There were many incidents throughout the course of the book that were irrelevant and just down-right discusting. The author made many refernces to women in a derogotory sense, which made me as a female feel degraded and uncomfortable. On more than one occasion Robert Cormier irrelevantly included more than one of the students pleasuring themselves whether it was at home or in school. These actions do not belong in a book that is read in school. It teaches to do wrong and think like a perverted man.\n\nAnswer:",

They look more cartoonish than they need to. The fightings o.k, but not good enough to be a good dragonball z game.

There was no adventure like the second volume. I was disappointed at the way the story ended. Aerial sacrificed herself throughout the story. Despite the finality of this triolgy, the story line is wonderful. Everyone who loves adventure and fantasy stories should consider reading this trilogy. The ending leaves me longing for more.

As I sat in theater 3 at the Nandesucon I thought this was an early 90's mecha flick. Past the opening scene I was suprised to find that it was actualy about three women who wanted to get back to earth. The characters are your average anime women, a tomboy schoolgirl, a ditzy teacher, and a renegade mech pilot. I have never been impresed with Bandai. I first knew them as the importers of Power Rangers, somthing that dwindled my respect for the company. This DVD does not have the best visual quality, but is much better than the static of Eat Man 98', for those of you who own it. Personaly I like this DVD, it has action, humor, and busty women.

The new model is poorly designed and lasts only a few weeks before it collapses.I owned at least five of these filters over the years; they usually lasted at least one year, although they always tended to soon start leaking around the ring that screws to the faucet. The new system seemed improved at first,(it was easier to install) but after a few weeks the plastic ring that holds it could not sustain the normal flow of the water coming down, and became stripped, causing the whole unit to fall down. Customer service has been helpful, repeatedly sending me replacement rings, but they all last only a few weeks. Too bad, because the filter insert did a decent job of removing the chlorine taste from the water.\n\nAnswer:",

Otherwise, pass this up and go for something with a little more substance.I don't know, maybe some of the bands this album rips riffs from -- Rolling Stones, for instance. If The Verve was sued, then Jet should be in court any day now.One song is a total Oasis rip-off--they even sing like them. Who are they trying to please?

When the vacuum is completed, you remove the wide-mouth jar sealer. The jar lid stays in place because of the negative vacuum pressure created inside the jar.

While the album was better than 98%of other releases and deserved some of the praise, it is not the best album by Spiritualized. The thing with this album is that it accomplished bandleader Jason Pierce's melding of traditional soul and gospel with old school psych-pop. The results are decidedly mixed: the title track, \"I think I'm in Love,\" \"Stay with Me,\"Broken Heart,\" and \"Cool Waves\" are exactly what the whole album should sound like.

I am 61 yr old and take three Hatha yoga classes per week: I am not new to yoga. I found her instructions often hard to hear (mumbling, eating her words) with little attention to modifications. Aside from her suggesting that you take a deep breath, there was little attention to the role of the breath in relation to the movement. I felt she was too relaxed/casual in her manner: assuming that the audience was actually using proper alignment with few cues regarding possible tricks to prevent common position errors. Savasana was very brief. I gave this DVD to my daughter who is a Certified Yoga Instructor. She hasn't given me her opinion yet but it would be interesting to hear what she thinks.This is one Yoga DVD I did not find useful nor enjoyable.

Having seen \"Clutch Cargo\" I thought I had seen the lowest of cheap animation, but NO! They took almost every panel from the comic, recolored them, and simply animated the mouths and arms! How much did Marvel pay for these cartoons back in 1966?!? The second episode, \"The Power Of Dr. Banner\", was even worse! And yet, somehow, I still felt I got my money's worth...simply for the origin story. You do get to see the classic Kirby artwork on the TV screen.

The moth \"floated\" to the top, possibly because ti is completely dried.Apparently, this how Marshalls Creek Spices decides to add protean to their spices.

I was distracted by the foul-mouthed Allen character; made to feel uncomfortable. Which was the point I guess. The film opens with a vicious argument and a strange, repeated image that unsettles. If you were expecting something else, you have to adjust.I adjusted better the second time through and enjoyed it much more, hence this edited review. There are plenty of good jokes (like the out of focus actor, played surprisingly subtly by Robin Williams) and set pieces. The scene when Harry visits his sister is particularly funny - classic Woody Allen.On the whole, I felt the film was treading old ground perhaps a little more than usual. I don't think of it as one of my favourite Woody Allen films, but it does stand repeated viewing.\n\nAnswer:",

As I was reading some of the hisory around the book, I learned that Mr. Tolkien had started it a bed time stories for his childeren. This is very believable, because I know I was often motivated to reading it aloud. Now, I am on to the Lord of the Rings!If you are at all interested, buy this book.\n\nAnswer:",

My personal favorite is Long Lost Brother Of Mine, but for sentimental reasons- when I heard this track, I was in a new city, about 1300 miles from friends and family, and I was really missing a close friend, hence the song 'spoke' to me.

I expected much more depth from Wells' characters. Because it is told as a series of flashbacks, the reader is only given thin facades of each character. None of Wells' characters seemed to possess a soul. I think Wells' intended message was that even though Siddalee endured so much abuse as a child, she realized that her mother loved her, and did her very best. A message often hard-learned, but after reading 356 pages, I expected much more depth, breadth, and a greater understanding for my own life experience and journey.\n\nAnswer:",

The dubbed-in operatic baritone by an Italian actor playing a Frenchman with an Italian accent both when he speaks and when he sings (?) sounds ludicrous to the 21st-century ear, the dialogue is frequently laughable, and the bizarre directorial decision to film some scenes through color filters that just look nasty, combine to make this an exceptionally overrated piece of nostalgic cheese. Plenty of ham to go with it, too. Bleah. The only reason there's more than one star in my rating is that the film does very well in making its point against racism, a socially redeeming factor that was very much germaine in the late '50s. But that's no reason anyone should be subjected to this snoozer at this late date.\n\nAnswer:",

At last the truth is told ! in a constructive a detailed manor.\n\nAnswer:",

This case is built for the 1gen - opening for your earbuds is on the WRONG side on this case, it's a little bit too small (though will work), and the plastic covering isn't positioned quite right to be able to control your scrolling.

I've probably made about 150 cups. In the last 3 months it's started to show some serious problems. Perhaps they are fixable but I wish I didn't have to have it serviced and can't even find parts on-line. The crema stopped after about 50 cups. The more serious and recent problems are that the basket seems to be seriously clogged, despite lemon juice or vinegar cleaning treatments and maybe because or in addition to this, the seal around the basket leaks and the steam setting leaks, sending some seriously hot gasses through the grinds and diluting your just made cup of espresso if you haven't removed it. Needless to say, this also diminishes the steam pressure available for frothing. I'm starting to look for a new one.\n\nAnswer:",

This book was highly original in the power of magicians. It's not just like using magic to do everything and being in secret from non-magic people. the structure of it is cool because of the way it has two main charaxters and switches views. Since magicians don't actually use magic, (they summon demons and the stronger the demon, the harder he is to control so you need to be a strong magician to control strong demons) Bartimeaus is actually the one with all the power, not Nathaniel (the magician).

I found little new information, there certainly isn't anything in this book that the better ones in the genre doesn't contain. Also the tone and level of advice in the book reeks of amateurism.Instead read for instance the aid climbing chapter in \"Mountaineering the Freedom of the Hills\" or \"Big Walls (How to Rock Climb Series),\" by John Long and John Middendorf, round that up with perhaps the best one in the field \"Climbing Big Walls,\" by Mike Strassman and you will be much better off.\n\nAnswer:",

Not only does this destroy the chorus and the climax of a normally brilliant song, but it drags Tori down to the level a street thug ghetto rapper. Its unforgivable and totally incomprehensible. If you can release a CD with naughty words, you oughtta be able to back it up on video. The rest of the DVD is okay, despite the horribly drawn massacre they make out of Crucify, and I think Take To The Sky is the highlight of the show, but I'm still so angry about Professional Widow that I refuse to ever watch this DVD again.The extra songs on the bonus disc make it barely worth the purchase, tho.\n\nAnswer:",

Plans go awry when the kingpin offers $100 million to anyone who can free him.This was a fun and excellent take on the '70s TV series where a wily SWAT sergeant returns to assemble, train, and lead a group of five officers who have to escort a notorious international criminal. Director Clark Johnson who has worked as a director (\"NYPD Blue\")or actor (\"Homicide\") on a TV police drama doesn't go over the top and lets the movie remain faithful to original source. The cast here is great with Jackson as \"Hondo\" and Farrell as Street and Olivier Martinez brings a weasel-like charm to his character. Even Steve Forrest, who portrayed Hondo on the TV series has a small role here which is nice to see.\n\nAnswer:",

What I do not like about it (although I could not give it less than 5 stars) is the regular-size NumLock key (some Logitech boards have a smaller NumLock key, which allows your to avoid pressing it accidentally). Well, it is just a wish, actially. Also, I am not crazy about the placement of the Delete key: it is somewhat hard to reach. The second ''|\\'' key exists for no reason (I guess that the manufacturer did not want to make another irregular size ''Alt'' or ''Start'' key ) and it kind of interferes, sitting between the ''SpaceBar'' and the left ''Alt''. Yes, I type fast, I type ALOT. So, certain things do make difference for me. There are no perfect keyboards, but this one is certainly above-the-average in so many ways.\n\nAnswer:",

For me it seemed to work best when the tip of the wand was parallel with the outer edge of the breaker. When you do find the \"right\" breaker you'll get both the tone (not to be confused with the ever-present 60Hz buzz) and the top red light is illuminated. Sometimes it seems like I get a \"tie\" -- pick one, open it, if the tone doesn't stop, it's the other one. Even under the worst of conditions where you can't decide, it's still somewhat handy, since flipping breakers one a time until the tone stops still beats flipping a breaker and jogging to some other part of the house to see if you got the right one.\n\nAnswer:",

(Such harmonies are the same ones Brian Wilson grew up with; the ones that influenced his Beach Boys compositions) But Fagan's The Nightfly is like a wine cooler: thin and dated. It's okay as far is it goes (and that's not very far) but not satisfying for more sophisitcated tastes. If you must have beginner's jazz in your system, get Steely Dan's Aja instead.

Phil Collins and Steve Hackett were good additions to the band and the playing all around is quite good. The only drawback is the short throwaway songs For Absent Friends and Harlequin in the absence of a good long song. The 3 long songs on the album are very good as are the fun Harold The Barrel and the more dramatic Seven Stones.\n\nAnswer:",

Oblivious to our parents life-less bodies, he locked himself in his room, determined to repair the cube and complete it's unholy puzzle. I could only hear animal-like howls and shrieks through the door. I haven't seen my brother in twelve years.

Though Parachute is but their first album, and as all 1st's are its not their greatest, (it's kinda like losing your virginity, a 1st album that is, the other 2 are just highly evolved masterpieces) it's still a must to have. Don't tell anyone, but Guster has replaced the spot for me that once only Dave Matthews could fill. So, take this advice and buy this cd (or tape if you must, maybe both!), try to be the first of your friends to have it! Guster is something the whole family will enjoy so go ahead, spend the meager bit o' dough and enrich your life today w/ Guster :).\n\nAnswer:",

It's wide angle diffuser lives permanently inside the unit, sliding out and clicking into place with ease. The flash is very good close-up, very good outdoors against the light. Sony's sophisticated flash control helps get exposures spot-on. It has extra AF assist LED's for the R1 (best turned off for the V3).

I ended up having to remove the heat sink and the low quality thermal compound I originally used due to bad performance.If you don't build computers all the time, as I don't, you will want to include Arctic Clean 1 & 2 for cleaning up and removing old thermal compound.I thought I had done my homework when I researched the components that went into my new system.

Tanaka is letting the images speak for themselves.If you're not a fan of anime or manga, don't be scared of this book. It stands by itself as a good example of Japanese illustration that, while having clear roots, goes beyond the cliches of most others.Highly recommended for any lover of comic and movie illustration.\n\nAnswer:",

However, be weary of this book if you have never previously read Lewis. The development of the story is rather slow and lethargic and the non-Lewis fan may find it difficult to get through the early chapters.

If you want to just plug it in and do something else, it takes about 4 hours to do a full charge of two batteries. However, you can do a partial charge (which charges the batteries just slightly less than the full charge,) in about two hours, provided you don't mind checking on the charger and taking the battery out of slot 1 after 1 hour so the battery in slot 2 can begin its partial charge. All in all, buying a couple of travel charges would probably be a better value. To do a super fast charge with this unit you must stay with it during charging.\n\nAnswer:",

Toshiba has basically done nothing although this was purchased through their website. NetGear has done less than nothing except provide empty promises and excuses.I would strongly urge you to do the following....buy your products through Amamzon.com not ToshibaDirect. And stay away from both Toshiba and NetGear products as their customer service is horrible.\n\nAnswer:",

After six-month use of the wok, I am surprised that it does not change color like any other wok did. I basically use it every day. I only use a kitchen towel to wipe it clean and never use dish detergent or dish washer. The condition of the non-stick surface is just like the first I got this perfect gift!Although its non-stick surface is strong and is allowed any material of utensil to be used on it, I use only wood or nylon type. I believe that using softer material would avoid deteriorating the non-stick surface.I will post a following review if any condition goes worse. Let's see how long it will persist. And by the time, it may be a good change to test their limited lift time warranty though.\n\nAnswer:",

Finally, the material is almost exactly duplicated on the AMERICAN ORIGINALS album.

(snicker)\nText: This is a fun little book. 5 1/2 x 8 inches, 128 pages (nearly half of which is commentary).Somewhat of a \"Poor Richard's Almanac\" of its time (published sporadically in one form or another for hundreds of years), only part of which can be attributed to Uncle Albert. It has apparently been edited substantially from its original Latin form, leaving out all the salacious bits for the prudent Western audience.It contains wondrous descriptions of the magical properties of stones, plants, and animals. Most of these descriptions are incomplete, or at least don't actually describe what their headings advertise. But most of the information was probably lost in translation or just plain edited out anyway, so just pretend that when something is missing or the text just doesn't make any sense that it is some arcane alchemical allegory.All in all, a fun read and a little history lesson from reading the commentary.\n\nAnswer:",

Dickens had a flair for telling ghost stories in a charming way. The acting is outstanding. There is no music or special effects to assist a weak plot or poor acting. The actors are terrific and the plot is terrific. Dickens sympathized with people in humble vocations and here the movie manages to cause one to feel for the signalman who is haunted by a specter. The specter portends two horrible events, and on the third occasion portends the death of the signalman himself. It wasn't out of morbid sentiment that Dickens made this his ending, but it serves his heartfelt sentiment for those kind souls who were born into misfortune, were caste into misfortune by evil personages, or, like here, who squandered it through some series of hapless bad choices. And here is the secret of Dicken's charming storytelling.\n\nAnswer:",

It is hard to get into a book if you don't really care for the main characters.The main character Dalton Moss is messed up. She is engaged to her boyfriend who lives back east, and sees another man who lives in L.A. who also has another serious girlfriend.Her fience comes off like an a-hole also because he gets mad when he finds out about Dalton's boy toy, but he also had something going on with his ex-girlfriend when they were working together in Africa.Also Dalton's friends are weird. Her friend Ava seems like a woman-child, probably due to the fact of her mob family and the step-mother almost the same age as she is who has sex with Ava's brother when their father is away. Her other friend Electra is as messed up as well.\n\nAnswer:",

This is a \"must-have\" for all Star Trek fans. The sound remix is awesome. Many scenes were cut out, and many scenes were added. Some new special effects were added in just the right places. I thought the original version had too much lighting - that too was fixed. I can now watch this movie over and over again without getting bored! The bonus features were great as well. I especially enjoyed finally hearing the story on Star Trek:Phase II (The series that almost was). The Director's edition-DVD crew deserves a big round of applause!\n\nAnswer:",

And the reason why is that Landon had to walk her home after he got in trouble because he didn't have a car and everyone walked back then. The relationship started on their walks.... I have had to disassociate myself from the wonderful books when I see the movie because I know that they are NOT going to be as good and this one really got off track like Nights in Rodante and Message in a Bottle where they added characters, and took out 1/2 the letters, and The Notebook where they changed the ending and have ruined any chances of \"The Wedding\" becoming a movie.\n\nAnswer:",

Not expensive, but a bit inconvenient. Second, the RBC7A did not fit nicely into my APC Smart UPS 1500. The width was just a bit wide. It almost seemed that it was slightly bulging on the sides. So the front stuck out just enough to where the front covers did not fit correctly. I had to force everything back together. Lastly, here is where it really lost points for me. I called Tripp customer service about the situation and they treated me with such indifference that they pretty much told me that that's your problem.

Finally, what I found as irritating as the excessive technical jargon was all the French.

Overall the album is simpler and more of a straight ahead rocker, compared to AoB and CW. Musically it lies somewhere between AoB and Bruce's earlier work, \"Ball to Picasso.\" The album starts out fairly heavy and then becomes more varied and emotive towards the end. Bruce's singing is magnificent though, sounding much better than the last two Maiden albums and I enjoyed every song.

RCA gets points for supporting Divx, commercial skip and HDMI out.However, this model is missing features and has a couple bugs. My biggest gripe is that RCA removed the \"Split Title\" feature which is a useful way to perform basic edits and to free up disc space. Also, the title screen doesn't always display correctly when playing finalized discs in other DVD players. Lastly, it seems to prefer +RW discs as I constantly got errors trying to record to plain +R DVDs.I would suggest looking at LG's line of recorders, or last year's Sony GX315.\n\nAnswer:",

The singing, acting, and orchestra are very good. So is the opera (one of Massenet.s most popular). But the scenery and the shift of time to the 1950s make it seem silly. As for the scenery, the giant tree that is the theme in all four acts is fine for act 1 (the garden) and act II (the town square, but is rather silly as the wall of the sitting room in act III and is totally ridiculous in Act IV where Werther's death bed in his bedroom is under this tree. Changing the time to the 1950s makes the plot unbeleavable. Girls of the 1950s simply didn't refused the man they loved to marry the man their late mother had wanted them to marry.\n\nAnswer:",

I did note one error in your synopsis which states that Natalie feels neglected by her husband and takes up with her patient. The character, Carter Sugarland, is her long time boyfriend, not husband, who will never make a commitment to Natalie. The synopsis makes it sound as though Natalie left her husband. This sort of review misrepresents the book and leads me to believe the writer of the synopsis did not read the book.\n\nAnswer:",

The many ideas and systems described by Allen sound great but, in the end, do not generate a coherent system. Of the dozens I could cite, I give just two examples.1. On page 170 he admonishes the reader to not use a categorization of \"Hold and Review\". One paragraph later he says that anything that one would have put in \"Hold/Review\" should actually go in \"Read/Review\"....with no substantive differentiation.2. The book is replete with instances where Allen creates a proper noun such as \"Someday/Maybe\" and then overlays it with another word \"Incubate\"...which sounds an awful lot like \"Hold (incubate?) and Review\".While I did not attempt to do so, my overwhelming impression is that a systematic reconsideration of the system and a rewriting of the book in which every component fits in a coherent way with the next, could turn this into a useful system.\n\nAnswer:",

It was a good idea to keep Ripley in it and bring her back along with the brilliant Miss Ryder but the story just didn't cook. Good moments but not really too much suspense. What would now be great is to see an Alien film with them on Earth, as this film had much promise and on its own is a very good film but as the 4th Alien film is a dissopointment on the first 2 but it thankfully makes 3 not seem as bad.\n\nAnswer:",

From the beginning paragraph to the end it is one of the most convoluted books I have ever read. This book really is \"A Savage Journey to the Heart of the American Dream.\" Thompson and his \"attourney\" do so many drugs in this book, you would think that they were madmen. However, on this strange trip it's is Thompson's madness that carries him through his dangerous adventures, it's almost like a catch 22. I would recommend this book to anyone that is mature enough for the contents. Thompson may be no \"Hemingway,\" but he has a knack of giving us a different perspective, as valid as it is skewed. Perhaps this is key, to understand and survive in a mixed up world one must be mixed up. Thompson's brilliant imagination (or perhaps reality) will propel you right through the book which is easy 1 or 2 day read. Have fun with it.\n\nAnswer:",

The GLUT is one way to create an \"opengl window,\" but the GLUT is by all means the most basic and useless of the possible methods.

I gave this two stars rather than one because for a reader new to the period the book at least encapsulates the basic facts and trends.

For those who have complained about the high price, I too put off this purchase due to cost. However (and I don't know if I can get away with stating this here), the recording is more widely available in Europe and you can acquire it via the web through European sellers whose prices are a good deal more reasonable. The service I used is a classical distributor out of Birmingham, England called Crotchet (the English term for a quarter-note); their service was impeccable and the price was approximately $43 U.S. Crotchet can be contacted through www.crotchet.co.uk.\n\nAnswer:",

It will explain with documented cited sourced facts and information as to why \"baby wise\" parenting is wrong and harmful to your child. NO babies are the same and there is no \"way\" or \"schedule\" that a child is set to follow. Babies espeacily those that are breast feed want to suckle not only for substance but for comfort a feeling of closeness that they shared with you in the womb, why deny them of that? CIO that's a good way for your child to mistrust you. Crying is the way children communicate and for a parent not to respond to a childs cries demeans the child. How can a parent listen to thier little one cry, your little one simply wants to be with you, again why deny them of that.

Too bad that I didn't accidentally erase it. After four hours watching the \"full version,\" I gained nothing and cared less about the characters and who did what to whom. The only pluses to it were the attention to detail in costumes, props, etc. and the acting which was credible. The story was preposterous even for a myth.I cannot believe that anyone over the age of 12 enjoyed this or even consider it worthy of purchase on DVD.\n\nAnswer:",

It took a couple of tries to clamp the drain pipe such that it didn't leak (I tried it a couple of times to check it before I did a whole load.) Connections for water/drain are easy. I usually do one-two loads a day, with one being a goal. It spins the items well. I don't have a dryer, but hang items on a couple of racks above my dehumidifier (has a blower that works perfectly for this) and I save money on dryer and reduce wear on my clothes. Even dries towels. Takes up to 24 hours, but that's okay!Worst experience was forgetting to put the drain pipe in the sink. A one-gallon wet vac is NOT sufficient for such an occurrence!\n\nAnswer:",

However, there are a couple of things to note about this book:1.) The description claims that there are many examples in each chapter. That is simply not true if you consider 1 trivial example for each section to be \"many\" examples. My professor kindly reminded me that pretty pictures and examples can be found in undergraduate vibrations books. Also, the matlab code in the book is not available anywhere online or on disk. This makes using the programs rather tedious.2.) The binding came unglued the first week I owned it which is really annoying since I dropped approximately 1 billion dollars on the thing.

I wondered if I could have the pale-cream surface back, and bought this.Sadly, I have had no success at all with this solution. I don't think that using this cleaner from the get-go would have been brilliant, because it made absolutely no difference to the stains.

The unit comes with an adapter that has 2 RCA jacks to a \"female\" mini jack, this is useless unless you have a male to male cable (which I do). The other things to note are the green LED (S/PDIF) stays on all the time signal or not even though the manual states if there is no signal the light wil \"go on & off\" (if I recall another review mentioned this as well).

It has the feeling of one song been sped up and slowed down and there are incidental words just thrown across it every now and then without thinking of the consequences . If you are a pop loving soul , then by all means buy this album ( if you haven't got it already ).

I'm a very petite woman - so these work for me - but I also have long hair. So when you snap the front together and pull the glasses up over your nose, because the \"tether\" is so stiff - it fights with my hair. And the option to leave them on the outside of my long hair isn't an option. So these are a great idea, if the tether was a bit softer or more flexible and/or they adjusted much longer. It would be great for a man with a small head or face - as they don't really give you much lee-way. I opened them up to the largest adjustment possible so they fit me - but again - I am small. So this would not be something for a large woman or your average male.I do love the idea that they pull apart and then snap together - because when I left them open on my neck - and I was wearing a scarf, no one even knew they were there and they really can be convenient. So just some tweaking and these would be the dream reading glasses!\n\nAnswer:",

Can't do a second cup quickly...too hot to handle the filter to clean it out...and messy.I totally wasted $15 on this item. What a waste of money.Hint to mfgs....the Keurig system works with HIGH PRESSURE forcing water through the coffee grounds quickly producing a GREAT cup of full bodied coffee...hence the slight foam on the top. This lid has no seal at the top....first time I used it I noticed it and wondered how it would work without a seal. It doesn't. My belief is that if a seal was put on the lid it would work fine. If you open a K-cup after use the coffee is smashed against the lid...but the sealed cup keeps the water and grounds from coming out the top. Bad design...good idea.\n\nAnswer:",

However, he was still unable to add any ounce of musicallity to even the most lyrical of melodies in the Quate. His tone also does not reach the level of brilliance that his former teacher, Eugene Rousseau, shows on the Heiden \"Fantasia Concertante\" on his own CD. I would recommend this CD only if you are a young student who wants to play the pieces with a metronome and along with the CD at the same time, as Fischer does not know the meaning of musical nuance. Maybe he will ask himself whether or not it is time to stop recording and focus on teaching. I will praise Fischer for one thing, This CD does not hurt my ears nearly as much as the first.

I was amazed at their energy, looks and unique sound. They quickly became my favorite as much as the Stones. I lost track of them in recent years and this CD brough back all their originality without loosing their youthful great music. Thank you Phil, Dick and the other Pretty's and thank you for the song \"Vivian Prince\" for bringing back memories of the wildest drummer in his time. This is my favorite piece on the album together with \"Play With Fire\" and \"God Give Me The Strength\". This is the greatest Pretty Things album since the 60's!!!Andras Pallavicini, Toronto, Ontario\n\nAnswer:",

This DVD played in a 1080p upconverting DVD player looks very clean and crisp relative to the VHS copy. Viewers should maintain proper perspective when assessing the video quality in that the vast majority of the source films were produced during the late 1930s and early 1940s by combat camera personnel from various military organizations worldwide. Considering that fact, this DVD is excellent. Regarding the content of the program, the DVD includes all original episodes from the VAS series; without editing. A worthy addition to the video library of any WWII or Naval Warfare history buff.\n\nAnswer:",

For $60, I was expecting just a little more. Would I spend that much on one of these again--nope! The concept is great.. even the picture on line is good, but the bins are tight and small. You can only fit in SMALL toys as many reviews have already said. You still have to find something else for your bigger toys. Again, great concept--but not entirely what I desired to have for most of our Kids toys. This should go for 1/2 the price then I'd feel better, since it only takes care of 40% of the toys in our home :(\n\nAnswer:",

So far I have made the potato cakes (potato, watercress wraped in bacon). Absolutely marvelous with a grilled steak. The fingerling potatoes roasted with tomatoes, garlic and cream are sensational.

Also the sex scenes feel a little gratuitous,and there is an undertone of paranoia which makes this a scaryfilm - this is definitely not a film for kids. What redeemsthis film is seeing how two of them manage to save themselves frombad situations. The filmmakers don't take the easy way out bycondemning all religious fundamentalists. If you want to know whythe mother is so paranoid about religion, read the novels of YasminaKhadra (like In the Name of God)In the Name of Godand Tahar Djaout (Last Summer of Reason).The Last Summer of Reason\n\nAnswer:",

To add to this reader's exasperation with this mysteriously superficial biography, Randolph Scott's adopted son states at several points that Randolph's life was much more complex than the son is willing to reveal out of respect to Randolph's wife and friends. My guess is that Randolph's family still controls what is by all accounts a fabulous estate; thus both their own as well as Randolph's privacy interests will live on. If the family will not cooperate with an effort to substantiate and compile a definitive biography, there is virtually no chance that the son will ever be able to tell us more.Nonetheless, my curiousity was relieved and I am grateful for crumbs.Alexander Witkowski\n\nAnswer:",

Using it requires practice, you must get it going fast and turn it at sufficient rate to keep it going, but once you discover how it feels once it's going you'll be able to do it again.It's possible to use while driving, though requires some careful attention and a place to quickly put it, like a cupholder, if you need both hands (otherwise it will spin all around the car).The main downsides are that it makes noise while spinning, which might annoy your family and makes it unusable in many office/work environments, and it can be uncomfortable to hold with mainly your thumb and forefinger (Once it gets going I usually reposition it so I am using all of my fingers and palm to hold it from the bottom-- a slightly different grip around the edge would have helped with this).\n\nAnswer:",

It is the most magical, moving and haunting piece written for small orchestra and vocalists. The redemption scene at the end in which a madwoman's madness is absolved is of such beauty and power it leaves you breathless.However, this recording does not show the piece to it's full potential. The performances while vocally strong, have brash, harsh and annoying \"old men belting\" sounds. Even the wonderful Peter Pearce is not at his best here, where his performance of the madwoman is just too sane and slightly cold and nasal. Occasionally, the diction is unclear too (perhaps due to the nature of the piece), and the band/orchestra lacks flow, fluidity and sensitivity.However, I would still urge any enthusiast in 20th Century opera to buy this!\n\nAnswer:",

The story, itself, is a nice idea. Finding a message about a man's undying love for his wife would get most women and their libidos racing to find \"man with love expressive language.\" You can ask most single women, and I guess married ones too, how often they hear a man express his love, passionately, to them or anyone else. The answer will probably not surprise you so, when a woman senses this in a man, even if he is expressing it for another woman, said woman will want it, at any cost. Sparks mixes his metaphors, and continued to ignore the verb-object agreement. For the most part, the book read like it was done by a first-time, romance novelist.\n\nAnswer:",

How did that happen?End of Story was very well written, with no hint of the protagonist's hesitant over-thinking (which I started looking for in Peter Abrahams'own work.) The plot moved well, and the locales were interesting. There was an air of humor in some of the scenes and the entire story just never lagged.In conclusion: surprisingly, I will read another of this author's books in hopes that he draws a character that I do not want killed. Combined with his storytelling talent, and great forward motion, the next review I write on Peter Abrahams just might be a five-star.\n\nAnswer:",

When I went to use it just 3 days later on my other car, it would not extract transmission fluid.The plastic fitting that connects to the top of the unit was sucking air, so it would not create a vacuum. I had to stuff a circular piece of paper napkin between the fitting and the opening to get it to seal and work somewhat.After the first use the unit was rinsed with a mild solvent and cleaned as per the instructions. The oil I extracted from the van was NOT synthetic (see someone else's review on that subject).

Is he still alive?Out to the record shop. Buy album. Not bad. Great rock. Heavyer than most stuff then. But contrasted with Ozzy's kinda whining voice.The A Side is nearly perfect. Especially the 7:24 minute title track - nearly epic. Other highlights are the opener Mr Tinkertrain and the closer Road To Nowhere. But unfortunately No More Tears fades in quality on the B Side, and you start getting enough of Ozzy's voice.\n\nAnswer:",

I am sorry to say that I found it very slow and over written. The characters are shallow, the story line is far fetched and the nding is just downright unsatisfactory. And then, just when you think you've reached the end you discover 'Hisorical notes.' We are all aware that it is a story so why prolong our torture with 'Historical notes'? Its not real and the notes are irrelevant. Not only that, they pose the question of how Offred was able to record them. No-where in the novel does she relay any such detail as her difficulty in keeping records. And finally, my last moan, why are the notes at the end? They would provide a good basis and outline of the novel. They belong at the front. Though to be perfectly honest the whole thing belongs in the bin.

As a consequence, it conveys no feelings to the spectator. There are no villains and no heroes - all characters are \"bad\" to some extent. The violence becomes senseless gore without empathy or sympathy, and the \"romantic moments\" are reduced to showing of bare flesh in paparazzi style.

Sadly Tom Clancy seems to have forgotten this and treats us to a 700 page preamble that had me wondering if I should sign up to save the rain forests. The paper used in the last third of the story was worthwhile and that's about the best I can say for it. Even so I often wonder how such works receive such tremendous critical acclaim - it is no different here in Britain or the rest of Europe. For anyone interested in how you write and produce a work far superior to this and in half the pages I urge you to read English techno-thriller writer John Templeton Smith's 'White Lie' - JTS is one of the most underrated of writers, but then we Brits haven't got a clue about marketing.

However, I quickly found it jammed when printing, and thus you had to reprint, eating up the tape quicker, which is not cheap. Also, I recall it requires a lot of batteries, which seem to be exhausted quickly, compared to other things I have that use far fewer batteries, like digital cameras. So, it became an expensive item to maintain (printing tape and batteries), which i got tired of doing. So I soon replaced it with a Brother, which has neither problem.\n\nAnswer:",

In this album, two thirds of 12 tracks were recorded with new arrangement by Paul's way, but the rest(track 1,2,3 & 11) were performed like original classics. As for \"Andante from piano concerto no. 21 by Mozart\", the old version(maybe recorded in 70's) is a lot better...more than I can say.If I had wanted to listen to original classics for these titles, I would chosen Karajan or Bernstein. That is why I rate this CD as 3 stars. ....Paul, you don't have to be a Karajan even in performing classics.

Using the selective focus feature doesn't help as some part of the image will be always out of focus. The Coolscan may produce a 4000 dpi scan, but it will not be sharp center-to-edge unless the film is absolutely flat -rarely the case. This problem offsets any advantage of using high-quality optics on your camera. This is a situation where the (excellent)specifications do not give the true indication of the results.\n\nAnswer:",

Hank Williams Jr., who had vowed to not make a half-hearted attempt to follow in the career of his musically gifted and fabled father, was visiting this North Atlantic island republic to cheer on his mentor Bobby Fischer (nee Fishpincher), who was locking horns with Rooskie chess icon Boris Spassky in a cold war World Chess Championship match. Hank Junior, who was a step away from grandmasterdom in his true love, chess, got drunk in an Icelandic pub the night before a match and started to ad lib an old Viking sea ditty with Thor Magnusson, a local musician. Bobby Fischer walked in, heard Hank's heart-rending sounds, and said, \"son, as brilliant a chess prodigy as you are, it's nigh time you put your board away and pick up your gee-tar.\" Hank took Fishpincher's advice and took off with it, running.

They arrived yesterday, I built them with no problem (think zoidz, without motors), and then I realized something: they're tiny. The xevoz tower over these mini dinos, preventing them from flying on the dactyls.Size (they are about 3\" high by 9\" wingspan) aside, these are nice figures. Each one has two interchangeable heads, one with a crest and no teeth, and one with teeth and without a crest. One figure is a bone-ish color, and the other is glow in the dark (not green).

If there is a weak link, it is the young actor who plays Oliver, who seems merely a director's product, although it may be Polanski's intent to use a novice in presenting the innocence of a child.

The color of the batteries does not match the plastic of the controllers, and the stickers on the batteries leave a terrible residue.The plus side? If you intend to use the two batteries together, one at a time while the other charges, then this should be fine, as each battery will last longer than the time taken to charge the other battery.

Design is nice and the unit has some punch and bass, but you pay for it in accuracy in the mids and highs. Vocals receded to the background and even sounded muffled compared to a much lower powered Tivoli iSongbook. The Songbook has less power, but I'll take it for it's true mids and highs.All these machines are basically a boombox with a dock. I should be able to get decent sound for $100, shouldn't I?Vann's was good about taking it back.\n\nAnswer:",

How much of the assumptions about how Dorothy Putnam felt or how she really reacted in her status as a publisher's wife can a reader believe? Surely, there is a story in Amelia Earhart's life for all time, but this book seems to be a sort of self-promotion for the author's distant family connections -- the (yet-unborn) great granddaughter of the (already deceased) Amelia Earhart. If the book were written based on Dorothy Putnam's own version of the story or Amelia's version, it might be more believable. Still, it is always interesting material to delve into anyone's personal diary -- famous or not....\n\nAnswer:",

Truly, this is a CD to avoid. Elton's fans should avoid it for the lackluster rhythms, simple chromatic melodies (if you can call them that)and banal Tim Rice lyrics and forced rhymes. Disney film fans - this is NOT Lion King of the Central American Jungle! There is no grand opening melodic sweep like \"Circle of Light\" - instead you've got the moronic repetition of \"El Dorado.\" There are no ballads like \"Can you hear the love\" - so there's nothing to compare it to. And the comic songs isn't very clever, although \"It's Tough to be a God\" comes close. One last comment, I could buy the Spanish rhythms - after all the main characters are Spanish - but where the hell did the country/western sound come into the picture at all? Dreamworks, if you want to rival Disney, get Phil Collins to do your music next time.\n\nAnswer:",

It is actually more about the late 50's to mid-Sixties US. It had a few nice photos but spent more time on the Moon and Mars Landings and the Cold War than it did on the Space Family Robinson. I was tremendously disappointed. Also, it could have been edited a bit better...many quotes are used as chapter headings and as photo captions and then often in the middle of the text as well! It looks real nice but is not worth the money. The best part of the book was the two-page interviews with most of the actors telling us what they have been up to since the end of the series. Don't buy this unless you are a real LinS fanatic. For great photos of the classic series I recommend the LinS Arcade Series Entertainment Utility CD from Sound Source Interactive instead.\n\nAnswer:",

It starts out beautifully describing a people, a lifestyle and a part of the country that all deserve the intricate detail that Mrs. Goodman uses to paint their picture. The problem is that after the picture is painted, it just stops. No story, no emotion, nothing. You so want the characters to interact and they simply brush against each other on occassion: even husband and wife, brother and brother. Several of the characters introduced actually dropped out of the story without an explination. I hoped until the last page that this book would \"wake up.\" It was sort of like watching it rain.

Not worth it to me to learn this level of complexity for the calories burned when I do not even like to mix in dance-y moves in the first place. Also, with the added complexity of the step involved (which I am new to), the likelihood of eating it trying to keep up and learn the moves is, even more, totally not worth it for me.I am keeping it for the blast only premix which is approximately 24 minutes to use as an add on to other workouts for maximum calorie burn in minimum time.\n\nAnswer:",

The song is an innovative mixture of pure Greek music (the bouzouki sound is prominent) and modern pop and Euro-dance rhythms!!! They have released another suchlike track, \"Follow Me\" which also follows this recipe of success! \"Die for you\" is a very nice single that can by heard by anyone and at any time! I think that especially the Europeans are going to adore it (if they already haven't)!!!The only reason I give it four stars is because I would like it to include one more remix-this time stronger!

Golden is increasingly forgotten today, but his writing was often a warm trip down memory lane. Golden wrote about and generally embraced humanity, the USA, the family, Jewish immigrants in New York City, Christianity, North Carolina, church matters, economics, etc. Golden had heart for the little guy, wrote candidly about sex, and one was of those rare southern publishers that opposed segregation in the 1950's. Ironically, or perhaps not, his newspaper was popular among Christian clergy. This book is now dated, but its warm and insightful look at humanity still applies.\n\nAnswer:",

And with the size of the cameras, hiding them is a breeze. I have had the system hit with some heavy Texas down pours without a hitch. I do not mind only being able to record all cameras in the four split screen mode. My only complaint is the remote is like a child's clicker toy, a bit fragile.

With my failing memory, I thought Ed Harris played the lead role and I wanted to see some of his earlier works again. Unfortunately, Ed Harris was not the leading man but real life Anne Archers husband. I purchased it anyway, and it was not as good as I remembered, the age of the film is showing and it has the low budget look. The chemistry is there with Archer and her husband and the towel scene is still classic. Mary Kay Place was a delight to see as supporting actress. I just loved her accent in this film even if it was a bit over the top. I own it now, so I may look at again when nostolgia occurs to see Anne Archer or MKP. Last film I saw with Anne was her film with Tommy Lee Jones in \"Man of the House\". If your looking for an old TEXAS romance film, this just might fill the bill.\n\nAnswer:",

They are good. For newbies, it will let them learn how cool the wiimote really is, and for a group it will keep them entertained, but its not a game to play by yourself.Games like tank, billiard and laser hockey are amusing; find mii, fishing and racing (on a cow!) feel like a waste of space.Need a wiimote? get itotherwise, I wouldn't recommend it.\n\nAnswer:",

There is only one complaint that was legitimate and that is getting up against the compressor that is hot and getting burnt. This too is almost an impossibility as only a minute portion of the compressor is not shielded by the plastic housing. The only complaint I can see is the noise of the compressor but in real use the compressor takes forever to kick on and doesn't take long to recover. The truth is that the compressor is better built than others and holds the air pressure even after weeks of setting unused. The brad gun is light and easy to use and easy to load...\n\nAnswer:",

There are still some typos but they aren't that numerous.Overall this is a good book, but not great. The story gets sidelined a few times with long reminisces about the protagonist's current and past life. The earthquake plot seemed pretty real. But all the odd encounters and situations that occurred would make for great TV/movie but in reality they probably wouldn't all occur to an individual.There is a plot revelation at the end that I won't give out. A lot of the things in the book don't play out very well if you go back and apply them with the relevation in mind - which is inconsistent.Overall a solid effort, but didn't quite strike home for me.\n\nAnswer:",

I just got my copy of Freedom's Choice and I just loved it. While some of the main characters from the other books made no more that token apperances, other new ones took their place. And the colonists managed all on their own to help and rescue many others found on the other colony worlds. I think that ms. McCaffrey did a wonderful job of showing just how everyone can work together, irreguardless of the species line. And in the time this book was set the species line was drawn not by what you looked like, but by what you could do. I like that, it says a lot about the potential for humanity. Lets hope that each of us can live a little of that ourselves. I'm trying to, how about you?\n\nAnswer:",

What separates this book from its electronically broadcasted brethren is one key component: good editing. Leitch's drawn out diatribes and abhorrent use of language leave the audience suffering from more than his self-effacing semi-biography. I have only one question: if it is obvious that Leitch has had such a horrible time living his own life, why would I want to waste my time reading about it?\n\nAnswer:",

Barrett does a great job of introducing and finishing the story with his pre and post notes that hint as if Rowley was a real person and theses are real memoirs. I don't rate this higher because I had trouble identifying Rowley as a character. Rowley doesn't give the impression that he's fallen \"in love\" with his captor (though he no doubt believes that he has), but rather he's been brainwashed by her. His actions and attitude indicate psychological injury not unlike a Patty Hearst Syndrome, and the reader ends up feeling a pathetic pity towards Rowley. Again, the best parts of the book are Barrett's own narratives, which entice you to research these Taiping warriors and learn more about this period of Chinese history. An ample escapist story to tide you over, but a far cry from 5 stars.\n\nAnswer:",

Though you try to do what it tells you to do, it doesn't seem to work.

This makes installation very tight and one has to bend the wires hard to fit in a single gang box or if this switch occupies the right-most position in a multi gang box.I was working with a three gang box and had to move the other switches around so this switch occupied the extreme left position.I would buy it again and also recommend it but wish Swylite would change the wiring entry configuration.\n\nAnswer:",

Can anyone think of a rock group before them to build its sound around the bass? Jack's playing on this record is extremely strong. Its no accident that this record was mixed with his instrument making up half the volume, the rest of the band the other half. His playing defined the group, and gave it a foundation which they could swirl around. When I first heard this record, Balin and Slick's voices seemed to me to be shaped to resemble dueling Yardbirds-like guitars, and they still do. The whole group is tight on this record, and very attentive to each other. You just don't hear this kind of work on other SF groups from the period-a mix of well-rehearsed instrumentation and improv. They rocked much harder than the Dead or other outfits.I just wish that Jorma's guitar work were more consistant here, my only real complaint.\n\nAnswer:",

Also, I really did enjoy both the \"get to the point\" and brevity of the book but, perhaps I missed something, because I was getting confused between the \"TEXT\" portion of his examples and the \"RESULT\" portions - they were always exactly the same! Once the \"REGEX\" portion was applied against the \"TEXT\", wasn't the \"RESULT\" portion supposed to show only what was filtered? This made the examples meaningless for me. Aside from that, the print quality wasn't there; it seemed that at some point it had become over-xeroxed at the office. Overall, at the very least, I believe the book to be a good primer. I hope to see Mr. Forta follow up somehow. Also, if you get this book, make sure to look up the 19 erratas on his website.\n\nAnswer:",

Why would she believe a woman she barely knows over the man who has been her lover? This is never explained well. Freddy, Edward's cousin, is a great character.

So I went and bought a few books on that, and it cost me over 30.

Stay-at-home dad and environmental lobbyist in D.C. and his cohorts expose the contradictory functioning of the National Science Foundation and the worse functioning, or lack thereof, of the U.S. political machine on Global Warming. Highly polemical but that's not its problem; writer didn't have a plot or story in mind so much as an expose.

However when he returns to England with Megan in tow he resorts to a non-caring attitude in front of his wife. He argues with Megan over sometimes trivial things. Good thing she will stand up for herself once in a while. I would of slapped the man on more than one occasion.If you can get past a few minor errors in exact period, a strained relationship, age difference, and a brutish guy then this book is one you can at least take a stab at reading.

Others are: \"Outta Your Head\", \"Drop Dead Georgeous\", and \"Avant Garden\" which has an interesting spiritual side.

A large Group of people used to gather almost everyday to sit around and just drink. People in the story were always concerned about their self. All they thought about was sex and how they needed it all of the time. I thought Jake, the main character and the narrator, shouldn't have had to go through what he went through; .He didn't deserve all that. Jake was an innocent man who just wanted on thing, and that was Brett.This novel is very similar to modern day times. Sometimes people engage in drinking just to get away from their everyday struggles.. The time in which this novel took place and now times are similar in ways. In both the characters in the novel and people now-a-days, turn to alcohol for relief and have tendencies to party all night long. Yet, there are parts in the book I cannot believe can occur, but this may be a good part of the novel; A place where dreams may happen.\n\nAnswer:",

The academic grounding that Laszlo tries here to create makes for too many contorted kinds of arguments. The author points to all the right issues, and he goes at them in ways that might, under another pen, have produced some startling breakthoughs in thought. But Laszlo is not the one to take this on. For those who still hjunger for a grand synthesis of all things -- human and cosmic - I suggest turning instead to someone like Ken Wilber, or -- if you have a few months of non-stop reading time -- to the colletced works of Alice A.

None of the three leads ever sang their roles on stage although Freni did sing the last act at the Met during a gala.With all of the wonderful attributes of the singers, the presence and heavy hand of von Karajan might be a turn off to many. Turns me off within the first 20 minutes of act one. The conducting is extremely slow, overly detailed and precious, which is why this is the only BUTTERFLY on three CDs --- therefore the expense is something else that might cause someone to another recording.For fans of Freni, a less expensive alternative to this recording is the video that was made at the same time of the recording.

Steve Morrisey's departure into solo proves both musically powerful and visually appealing. Morrisey's \"Hulmerist\" is indeed fun to watch.Favorite Morrisey songs such as \"Last of the International Playboys,\" \"Ouija Board,\" and \"Interesting Drug\" are on here. They show Morrisey much the romantic that is not readily evident on his music. Too, his selection of Directors is quite noteworthy. Unlike the modern glamourboy images so prevelent on MTV, Morrisey looks very common as his followers. The fan footage, though sometimes drawn-out, shows his appeal in the UK.Clearly this video is an excellent buy for those who enjoyed Morrisey's earlier solo days. What better than to see it on your TV!\n\nAnswer:",

Lehane is an icon, whose works have been SO stand-out, with his earlier works absolutely brilliant, especially Shutter Island (in my opinion his Kafka-esque masterpiece). Now this.... It can only be called a cop-out, an escape from the widespread criticism Shutter Island received (from doltheads); what he's done here, in this evocation of early 20th-c. Boston, is sort of an evasive action, it seems to me. Much as I've loved every one of Lehane's earlier works, this one was beyond me -- uninteresting period and place, and very uninteresting characters (with the possible exception of an imagined Babe Ruth in the first chapter). Hard as I tried, I had to give up on page 169. This kind of historical thing from someone like Lehane is like Hemingway doing a Barbara Cartland....................

There is a powerful theme in Thomas Hudson's time in Cuba hunting German submarines and his isolation and despair over the loss of his sons. It carries well into the emotion of his relentless hunt throughout Cuban waters for the Germans in the novel. This should have been used to finish off the movie. Instead Schaffner switches over into late 50's Cuba??? It weakens the end. Excellent first two thirds, though. The casting of George C. Scott as Hudson is brilliant. It fits him like a glove.

I didn't figure this out though until my second shipment because I called to get a repalcement. With the first shipment I had thought that I had been shipped an already returned product because it(the box) was not in the original shrink-wrap packaging and the \"doll\"/extras video and what I had thought to be included-the complete set of cartoons on DVD's,was not in it. So, hence my call to customer service for an replacement. I, of course, finally figured out once I received the new shipment that, \"IT\" was only a house-shaped box & extras DVD. What about the \"doll\", you say? Well, they apparently don't include that any longer as per the sticker on the boxs packaging.

In the cat mysteries I write, I made up an entire county in northeast Georgia, but it never occurs to anyone (I think???) to assume they could find it on a map. Just so Davis gives us an exercise in critical thinking -- as in, I'm thinking that a meter is longer than a yard, and certainly longer than a foot.

If anyone could do that they certainly wouldn't need to read any books on making money. The books states that the only \"risk\" is the risk of \"lost opportunity.\" WRONG! If the stock purchased for the covered call goes to zero then all you have left is the premium for selling the option. So the losses could far exceed the potential pay off. In other words, lots of risk for a small fixed reward. Now name the billionaire that made money like that?

Vanessa can write her music, play the piano, evoke many emotions, etc....the standout track on her debut is the rocking UNSUNG with almost torch song like style vocals....her ballads WANTED and PRETTY BABY are also very beautiful....and her haunting TWILIGHT caps off an almost flawless debut....here's hoping she is around for a long while!!!\n\nAnswer:",

It opened to us, young jazz musicians of those days, a new dimensions in jazz. What struck me most was a unique transparency of rythmic background which rythm section was providing. It was done by very laconic but impressive chord play of Jim Hall, accurate swing of Ben Riley. Rollins' solos were very profound, full of feelings. This marks them noticeably from what he plays nowdays. Jim Hall was very young and full of energy and apart from elegant chord support also produced a number of beautiful solos of his own. I would recommend everybody who likes Rollins and Hall to buy this recording.\n\nAnswer:",

It is experimental and diverse enough (instrumental, singing, speech) that you find yourself engaged at every turn. My French is spotty, but I was drawn in all the way, alternately looking up some words on the internet and just letting the music wash over me when I got lost. When the piece ended, I wanted to listen again. That's the love it part. Et Si Tout is perhaps just too personal to the composer and experimental a piece for me to connect with. Again, if one is fluent in French, it might be better, but after loving Chansons, I didn't have the patience to endure this 35 min let down. Would I still buy the disc, given what I know now? Yes. Chanson and track 5 run a solid 40 min; I don't feel cheated. I just ripped the first 5 tracks to my computer and put the disc away.

The main track was not long enough to put me to sleep and having to get up to increase the volume on the last two tracks destroyed any beneficial effects from the first tracks. The volume drop on the subsequent tracks, with the stated intention to not disturb you if you are sleeping after the first one, doesn't work if you're not, makes it impossible to use the tracks consecutively.\n\nAnswer:",

The plastic clamp-like device that secures the holder to the music stand is not very secure and can be dislodged from the music stand. It would have been better if Manhasset improves on this design (shortcoming). The holding system for the violin and bow also works around gravity and tapping the violin may dislodge the violin off the violin holder. For adults, I think this holder may benefit, but for children (with a dog in the house) this holder is questionable for home use/practice.\n\nAnswer:",

Making such a big deal (book) out of so small a chapter seemed somewhat lame, to me.Overall, Queen Sayoko is both funny and charming, with the slightest hint of romance.

Perfect use of colors, ie its emphasis in dark and red hues. The slow shutter speed used in this film also brings incredible realism to this movie. Also pretty accurate special effects. Other than than that the movie has a marginal, at best, script and plot. The acting is so-so and the chracters are completely forgetable.

It's probably simply because there is conversation between intelligent adults, mostly about history. The acting is virtually non-existent, it's just one guy talking while others are reacting and asking questions. This lecture style really aids you to just go along with the story. Not much new is said in those conversations, but a pleasant insight into history, religion and such engaging topics.Said silly premise is that a young university teacher claims to be 14 thousand years old, when saying goodbye to some of his colleagues at a farewell gathering.Again, don't be put off by the silliness of the basic idea, it's an entertaining movie for those who enjoy mental stimuli.\n\nAnswer:",

The graphics and controls are decent, meaning that you can generally distinguish targets and terrain and the movement isn't difficult to master. The fundamentals of the game are sound in that the solo missions are satisfying, the campaigns follow the same theme as the solo's, but it's the multiplayer that is the biggest let down. Unfortunately there are cheat codes that find their way into the multi-play. So, for example, if you are playing flagball and someone is using speed-cheat, forget it, the game is over. And there is almost always at least one person cheating. Artillery support in King of the Hill is equally ruinous of any fun.I definitely wish I had picked up another game. Once you get tired of the solo work, which is quick, the multiplay is so dissappointing that there is no long term value in the game. Wait for something better.\n\nAnswer:",

One of them was Larry Goldings, originally a pianist working with Jon Hendricks and JIm Hall among others, this great CD is his debut album on the organ and his debt to the Jimmy Smith tradition is obvious at the recording time. Pairing with Peter Bernstein on gitar and the \"wonderboy\" Bill Stewart on drums, this a tight quality trio plays standards like \"Skylark\" and \"When Johnny Comes Marching Home\" with demand and control. Veteran tenor saxofonist David \"Fathead\" Newman add punch and colour to some of the tunes but not at a level expected from that man. For B3 afficiados - notice a unfamiliar jazz organ sound on Goldings B3 since he's using a vibrato registration that is more convenient to the theatre organ tradition...shaky but doesn't diminish the overall quality of the album.\n\nAnswer:",

The machine does give a good workout and serves its purpose. It's a little heavy and awkward when pulling out the foot plate and raising the levels. It you are not that strong with your upper body then this machine would be difficult to open and adjust. The sliding bench also came off track and is a pain to get back on. I did not feel like paying a lot of money for the other products. But, if you want a better quality product I suggest to look elsewhere. I found the product for 99 bucks at the Weider website.\n\nAnswer:",

Yet for all that it is a mostly conservative yet fantastic vision of a very possible future, one that most people have not internalized, have not prepared for, but will very likely see. It puts the gray haze of future technology into a clearer picture. As such, I would characterize this book as an important read for almost anyone, despite its myriad faults.

I placed a 2\" memory form topper to lessen the sag, which works but the dip is still there if you look really carefully. This Mattress Remedy really helps to eliminate the sag, restore firmness and even create a lil' lump via over-inflation. I figure that this acts as a lumbar support for my back if I sleep in the middle of the bed and so far it works. But the pump came apart upon 1st pump. It still works and crazy glue will fix that but you can imagine how bad quality that pump is. Before you throw away your sagging mattress, please do the planet a favor and give this a try, you may be surprised at how $40 can solve a $400 problem!\n\nAnswer:",

From the first moment the dialog began I cringed inside and any sliver of hope I had (even at this point), I knew was extremely wishful. The script was dreadful, it was reminiscent of someone you meet who upon trying to impress you, tries too hard, is a name dropper and talks incessantly about subjects you are informed of in a way that is immature and simply uncomfortable. If you are someone who understands the historical importance of Ada, this plot will be nothing but torture to you, and feel strikingly sacrilegious. This movie is not intelligent, but rather, it is insulting, has it's own agenda, takes credit for ideas that have been established by others, marries multiple plots into an annoying and badly acted overkill and is mostly disrespectful, as Ada's name has been used and defamed.\n\nAnswer:",

He talks about ancient power objects held in storage by his tribe and about the knowledge, accumulated by his tribe of hundreds of years, of the alternate reality that one can encounter in the bush.

Missing the extra earplugs though the blister pack was fully closed and had not been previously opened.3. All parts included and no satanic sound effects, however I have to admit that the earphones bundled with my Sansa sound much better than these (and that being despite the fact that I much prefer ear plugs over the bundled type).I thought these would rival the Spark Plugs I purchased a while back, but at approximately 3x the price, they don't.

We read the maybe slightly updated version from the 'olde english' and the main part of the struggle was figuring what the hell was going on. Then, when you finally figured it out, it was something maybe KIND OF funny, in a satirical yet also juvenile way. It basically takes you an hour to decode that once again, some miller is cheating on his wife, with, oh, say a goat.If you want a 'difficult read,' I would say read existentialism.

The image itself was clearly fuzzy with age and missing or brutalized frames weren't massaged digitally at all, as far as I could tell. Ten dollars isn't too much to pay for my favorite Cary Grant comedy, by any means, and I'm glad I have it, but when I get my home entertainment center in order, I surely hope to find these reviews to be true, because my experience with this disk was that it was as sloppy as many of those Image DVD's that came out right after the format was invented, and I felt it was misleading to release this disk with the gold banners and all the marketing trappings of some kind of special edition, when so much was messy.\n\nAnswer:",

The leading lady deserves a lot of credit for creating an iconic character. She is attractive, revolting, monstrous and pitiful all at once. Overall, the film is pretty sickening, rising above the level of utter hack schlock, but lacking the nuance to make it work.

Feasts are ultimately a spectacle where food is used to project personal influence, make deals and curry favors. As Strong shows, these motivations haven't changed thru seismic changes in the art of the meal (introduction of fork and spoon, tables, sugar, spice ..). The prehistoric culinary history spanning the Greek and Romans is fascinating, as is the rediscovery of these \"excesses\" under the watchful eyes of the church. The post-renaissance portrayal becomes less intrigue and more detail, although there are some nice segments about the effect of sugar, the rise and fall of spice and the emergence of etiquette. The latter half of the book could be more entertaining, but all in all worth a read.\n\nAnswer:",

The ink from gel type pens never seems to dry and will smear big time, even after a several minutes. A sharpie is really your only alternative.

Largely autobiographical, and including many mundane details of the lives of her boring friends, the book gives no sense of her growth as a person, a serious weakness in personal anecdotal material. Ms. Powers also lacks a sense of history, or the logical facility to come to conclusions based on facts and comparisons. Everything simply IS.

I tend to give this book a 1-2 stars on mystery and action scale, 3-4 stars on both historical and romance scales.This is actually a very good romance novel. Female readers will sure enjoy this novel better than most male counterparts. Typical to most lady writers, details are presently vivid on the characters and actions they did.If you are looking for a Da Vinci Code-like thriller in this book, you might as well forget about it. I almost abandoned this book after 100+ pages of nothing. But I strived to finish it, since Miss Mosse is one of the Orange Award on literatures, and she must have some \"muscle\" at the end. It did have some muscle. It was a good recount on historical accounts of Alaise, superimposing the plot with current day Alice Tanner (who is Alaise's descendent).Not recommended for anyone looking for a fast paced story, but recommended for romance and historical buffs alike.\n\nAnswer:",

While he doesn't ignore periods entirely, O'Gormans approach is to concentrate on key architectural principles, primarily structural, and use buildings, or even simplified sketches, to illustrate them. The book would have been even better if the glossary at the end were expanded, and used some sketches: words are frequently far less useful than pictures in explaining a term. Also, I found O'Gormans introduction a bit forced and wordy. Conversely, the last few pages of the book, in which he hurriedly covers such topics as the importance of history and association in interpreting architectural work, were fascinating, but rushed.\n\nAnswer:",

Also, they have four presets for each part, and not a way for you to design a totally new saucer. As aforementioned, since there is no cross bredding, you cannot make a new class.

This book is great at that, but I was very disappointed to find that the thin brochure has very poor layout - like a printed word document bound into paperback. And no figures are included at all, although they are mentioned in text. A list of Montessori tools is also useless without figures and illustrations, because one can not visualise what the text is describing. So, all in all, this does not help a parent in actually working the Montessori way - this is more or less just a chain of thoughts that are behind the method. For a practical demonstration some other book must be selected.\n\nAnswer:",

The music is so glaring I push the mute button on and the visual effects more resemble the Outer Limits. Also although I think Forrest Whitaker is a fine actor (and in this case producer) he seems miscast. In the 80's version you only had a narrator and this series would have done well to follow suit-no one can take Rod Serling's place. As for the episodes themselves, some are pretty good and others so-so. Being a fan I still bought the set knowing all of the aforementioned from watching some of the shows when they first aired. This may well be the last attempt to revive this otherwise outstanding series which is likely the most beloved sci-fi gem. Maybe we'll all luck out and an unlikely network like AMC will take it on in the same quality format as they did w/ their hit show Mad Men.\n\nAnswer:",

The powermatic was the winner. You can't go wrong with the 5 hp motor, fine machined table, steel machined crank locking knobs, bigger crank handles, rock solid fence. The saw came with a QA label showing arbor runnout, etc. I set it up in about 4 hrs and ran a machinist straight edge over the table. The saw measured out at .002 flatness, pretty good. You will need to buy a 10 ga wire, plug, etc to hook it up. The manual was clearly written. The saw has not been slowed down while cutting everything from ripping old hard oak to maple. Great piece of equipment. The only concern was the PM 66 had always used a 3VX belt to drive the pulleys and Amazon even advertised as such. However, when I received my saw it only has 2 belts and pulleys. This was very misleading in my view. Overall - good saw, but have had the saw for over a year and Amazon is still advertising the 3VX belt.\n\nAnswer:",

Yet, when everyone who has been urging her into these romantic nightmares gives up on her, there is a strange let down until she discovers that Fate is willing to give her one last chance. Her \"Marley\" is the ghost of an old woman with the unlikely name of Mrs. Batty Smith, who informs her that three spirits will visit her to encourage her to change her ways. Cupid, aka, Valentines' Past, is sort of cute, albeit irksome. Valentines' Present is the ideal man, one that readers who like to play the book as a movie in their head will want to hit pause on when he comes around. The spirit of the Future- we won't go there. Suffice it to say, she outdoes Christmas Future on the scary level. With more humor than Dickens, readers are given an equally meaningful message that applies to any day, not just Valentine's Day.\n\nAnswer:",

Praise Satan for evil people who call themselves Christians and actually enjoy this book. May they suffer in the afterlife!!\n\nAnswer:",

Such music can often sound trite, weak, bland or lifeless. Not Jack's opus however. The songs on this album are quietly and sensitively poetic - listen carefully to tracks such as the trad rock 'Flake', 'Inaudible Melodies' and 'Middle Man'. Jack Johnson is an analytical songwriter - he knows what is essential and sticks to it. He conveys a lot with what, on the surface, appears very little. Brings to mind cool, warm Californian evenings on the beach. I've never been there, but this is the atmosphere Jack Johnson seems to create. A cool fusion of surfer philosophy and guitar creativity.

The set buzzes out of the box. You can hear the buzz sound over 10 ft away when there is no dialog or you put the TV on mute. The set was manufatured Nov in Mexico so even the latest ones have this problem! Mine is on its way back.\n\nAnswer:",

The entire soundtrack clocks in at a jawdroppingly shallow 27 minutes 52 seconds.I think my experience with resonate with other buyers: I played the soundtrack once, trying to capture a bit of the spark from an enjoyable *little* movie. But what you find is that any verve came from a combination of the songs with the video. Best example: the 'Evita' moment - a spirited rendition of \"Don't Cry For Me Argentina\" - is rendered flat and affectless on CD. Not seeing the audience jump up on cue, Madonna-like, in classic Evita pose succeeds in draining the fun out of the track. What you're left with is dinner show-quality takes of well-worn Broadway tunes...and, not even the whole tunes, just what amounts to a 28 minute medley with some useless interspersed dialogue.\n\nAnswer:",

He writes simply for enjoyment.Many of the 59 poems betray a youthful haste and lack of \"A Doubt?\" expresses sharp feeling in a spare, clean and concise form; \"Unknown\" has a clear, cwell-maintained sense of rhythm; \"Your Name Must Be Beauty\" has lovely correspondences (\"slowly\", \"softly\") especially in the first stanza.On the whole, these expressions of sentiment for a real or ideal love are sincere and accessible. The book is deftly illustrated by Derek Lee\n\nAnswer:",

Poor editing, chaotic organization of chapters and (maybe in an intent of making the book more enjoyable) a fixation in Dr. Mastria's story instead of his discovery make of it a dull reading. The writing is very confusing. You have to read the book a few times to find the very simple things he wants to say. He seems mistified for his own discovery and its importance, which is kind of anoying. I'm sure a class or a conversation with the author would be a lot more interesting and enlightening.In short, I found his ideas are really worthy and helpful.

It's most important feature is that you can clean and maintain it as often as you want without having to replace it.You simply cannot expect a high performance gain from a filter installed in the stock filter box, in a stock, low-rev engine. Yes, it sounds better at high rev and maybe adds a couple of HP, but that's not really noticeable in an engine with 160HP to boot with. Even a CAI would not benefit that engine that much - not without a proper ECU remap. With that combo you might be flirting with 2 digit gains (like 10% best, with a good mileage penalty tho).So buy with confidence that this filter is not magic...4x stars exactly cause they exaggerate a bit in their site about performance gains...\n\nAnswer:",

The tones were way too low --the sound of the plastic dolphins hitting against the plastic ring was most often louder than their \"singing\" And, with two kids in the tub, this toy took up TOO much room. Water Symphony had two performances before bad reviews from my kids closed it for good at our home.\n\nAnswer:",

Struggling with the accessories to add to her collection is a constant as everything AG sells is so darn over-priced! I must say that I wasnt even happy about spending over 50 on this piece of furniture but I am glad I did. It is very roomy, it holds about 20 outfits (also generic brand lol), has racks for accessories and shoes, folds up nicely, very simple classic design (white finish with ribbon), and the additional doll vanity and stool is great for roll-play with the dolls. I will be searching for the bunk bed next and soon to review!\n\nAnswer:",

And I like that, I like Radiohead for being anti-Blair, and even more so for being against major corporations and dollars and cents in general. Indeed they are. Just as long as the heart matters too (Pyramid Song) I can dig a little piece of Autechre (like in Pulk/Pull). I think of Amnesiac as the bridge between OK Computer and Kid A.

Flying below the radar screen for most people, this band offers soft wispy melodies that are catchy, well produced and keep me hitting the repeat button on certain tracks. \"But I'm Still Here\" is a jazzy hook-laden charmer that is entrancing. Songwriter and guitarist Patrick Linton has soft vocals that are engaging as on \"Yellow Dusk,\" \"And though it seems that I am older, a thing I never wanted to be, and suddenly the world is golden, there is nothing left out there for me.\" \"Where I'm Going\" is a piano based road song like a pastiche of images, \"And I look into those eyes, we got such a long way to go.\" While not every track works equally well, the CD maintains interest because Linton has unique musical ideas and keeps trying different things.

When I called to ask about warranty they asked how I knew it wasn't working. I suspect they wanted me to say I still had bugs. But the blinky LED and the absence of the Slight clicking sound convinced them they should send me another unit. This is the ONLY reason I give them three stars, they actually shipped me a replacement unit. As for functionality... I couldn't say empirically that it works but I think it put an ever so slight dent in the number of bugs in my house, but did nothing to the level of one or two furry critters in the house any given winter. Regardless to say due to the presence of invertebrates and furry vertebrates the wife and I hired Orkin yet still have some bugs but not nearly as many as pre-Orkin.\n\nAnswer:",

Somehow, however, it seems incredible to me that Richard Sharpe happened to be at every dramatic episode, from bringing the crucial message to the Bruxelles ball to charging the Guard in the end and always turning the tide at crucial moments. Seeing that Sharpe also instigated the crucial breakthrough at Vitoria, I can't wait to find out that he was also at Borodino, Leipzig and probably any french defeat you care to mention. Is he going to poison the exile at St Helena? Does Napoleon know Sharpe beat him almost singlehandedly, despite the incompetent british officers, cowardly spaniards and the perfidious prussians?

Enough already with the matching yellows. The cover tells you everything you need to know about this silly book. No need to look further.My recommendation: Pass on this one. Quickly.\n\nAnswer:",

Another thing is why is an RSX faster then a supra~ ridiculous!It has got to the point where i would be yelling profanities at the tv screen. Best racing game ever?! hmmmmm thats definately questionable , with a measly small choice of cars and somewhat weak gameplay u can expect GT4 to wipe this game out< i gave it 2 stars for NOS and ONline PLAY\n\nAnswer:",

The ball clouded up from gerbil waste within hours of them moving in, requiring it to be cleaned daily, unless you like watching waste go around in circle.

The addition of female vocals on several songs, particularly \"Nothing Better\", was genius.Four stars because while the album still does reach a boring lull in the middle (ie/Clark Gable, Recylced Air), the first four and final three tracks are all remarkable in their own right.\n\nAnswer:",

I do appreciate the author's evident sense of wonder. Unfortunately, much of that wonder is wasted on a narcissistic insistence that the Wonder is Wolfram's Alone (courtesy Mathematica).

As a book titled, \"Programming Windows\", it's not complete. Read together with books like \"Advanced Windows\", \"Inside COM\".2. Very little mention of NT features, for example MaskBlt, PlgBlt, world transformation, NT 5.0 features.3. Bad programming styles, for example, no C++, not much code reuse, every program has a WinMain and registers a class, no assert, lots of static variables which are dangerous in multithreading environment, no exception handling, only single instance of window allowed because use of static variables, no much const where should be.4. Information not fully updated for Win32 API, for example, use RegisterClass instead of RegisterClassEx, spool file name on p. 599; the warning that you should not delete stock object on p. 162 (which is actually safe in Win32);\n\nAnswer:",

From Tchaikovsky to Barber, we get a well played and recorded program of works, usually found on discs featuring a single composer. The big work \"Romeo and Juliet\" comes off nicely, but the other shorter works also shine.The \"Volcalise\" includes the soprano solo version as a bonus.This is an excellent disc for those on a budget, those filling gaps in their collections, and for those begining to appreciate the classics. Virtually unknown conductors and obscure ExSovietorchestras are the performers, and for sure there are better performances of all this music. Hence my reservations on giving a 5th star.

Sadly, Fitch's diction has drifted over the valley of literary art like a vast headache and made people dumb with pain.If you mock my figures of speech, I applaud you. Oleander is overgrown with them. (Incidentally, I pulled these weeds from the fields of White Oleander.)Read this book if you want to expose yourself to today's literary allergens. If it doesn't bolster your appreciation for good writing by way of bad example, nothing will.

Instead the workman-like Freddie Francis steps in for old Terry(who was apprently sick at the time) And delievers a sort of quase-shawshbuckler-mad scientist movie. Not special or in-depth like Fisher's entries, but a fun sleazy gulity pleasure trip. Francis imbues the film with a gritty damp feel, quit unlike the earlier entrys or later ones, contrasted in John Wilcox's flat photogaphy. And Anthony Hinds's poorly scripted screenplay (one of his worst) manages to conjure up some absurd snappy diolouge, that will keep any Bad-cinema buff entertained.Unfortunetly this guilty treat is not avaiable in it's un-cut format, which consists of scense shot from TV upon it;s original TV airing. Though these cut, or added scenes (which ever you like to term them) can be seen on AMC, whenever they happen to air it.\n\nAnswer:",

But here he does not take the repeats and his pace is, ah, rapid. So rather than a stroll through the countryside, poor Beethoven is trotted along. Your heart bleeds for him by the end. You worry about his health. You think, oh this can't be good. Heart attack any moment? Why are they abusing the man? Stop for a breath! No repeats are taken. No one is allowed to enjoy the view. No. Only between the movements when some souls dare to clap. Is it over? Is it bow time, was it really that short? On to the next run, the next lap.Listening to the end, the audience doesn't know what to think. Did he end it? Did he chop it up, was this Beethoven? Oh, Carlos, what were you thinking?And no cheers for Orfeo. An abbreviated 6th and that is it on a full price disk? Grrrr.\n\nAnswer:",

In the end some of the product had to be dumped out to make room to tint the paint.

But they gamely press on to the end, leaving out Paul's surprise Her Majesty tag.

It seemed to all lead up to Hesse's message regarding the responsibility of the self to accept the responsibility of guiding others and that pure followers are doomed to disappear.

As many have pointed out, the first chapter (actually a 27 page paragraph) makes the author analyze a room of Polish people and, without knowing the language or actually hearing conversations in toto, assign them roles as if casting the play that follows. I think this is why we are left with incompletely fleshed out characters. The premise of the book ( expatriation from European nobility to American homgenation) has been written before and better. There are pages of beautiful descriptive writing to be sure - Sontag is well practiced at her craft - but in the end we are left not really caring about the stolid, laborious venture through which we've waded. Though Sontag is hypnotized by studies of history's influences on the present, I think she writes better when she sticks to her own metier.\n\nAnswer:",

As a spring break film you need to focus on the women, the souped-up rides ( not the regular rides, unless there are a group of females in them), the type characters you see there and the parties and activities. This person clearly didn't do that. The only good part was the last 2 minutes of the dvd, which was like a quick collection of clips of the things you wanted, and also you can see this part by itself labeled as a bonus video.\n\nAnswer:",

Not only that the explainations for some of the problems are really bad. The reason why people think physics is hard is b/c of books like these that make it hard. THEIR are even mistakes in the formulas they use and they dont round numbers to significant digits. Im the top of my class in physics only b/c i like science, this book can change your mind real fast. The book does not explain who and how which is vital in learnig and passing any science test.

It suffers from poor editing, poor image reproduction and questionable image use. The stories are so so and I felt the print quality of it didn't justify the price whatsoever in the end.

By adding replacing the antenna that came with the unit with the Crane, I got more oomph in the bass (and it was still tight, without spreading out) and more fullness and musicality in the treble. Sounds like a lot of flowery talk, but it did improve the sound. Was it a night and day change? No - with the exception of small chamber ensembles played on our classical station - WOW, better than a cd and about as good as nice vinyl. Did I expect to improve my 8 grand system phenominally or to a point that I couldn't live without it with a 30$ atenna, no - but there was an improvement.In the end, it works, no huge change, and I guess that some people could see similar or better improvements for relatively cheap by upgrading their interconnect wires. It did make a better sound and I'm keeping them.\n\nAnswer:",

The 2nd most detailed section is about TMA.

We were not sure they would be sturdy enough for a move and/or if young kids accidentally get hold of it. Bot happened and they are doing very well so far. We love the space saved even though it doesn't exactly match all the previous seasons.Second, I was leary of so many changes for this season and had only been able to see a few episodes since we rely on the airwaves for our regular TV viewing. We have been pleased so far to see much of what we enjoy still in the show although we would prefer the original cast and with more interaction with a secondary group made up of some newcomers instead of what we see. The show is still too good to pass up on and the DVDs view so much like movie quality that we still have to give it the full 5 stars.

Overall the lyrics of loves remembered and existing long term loves further kindled is really rich in the thoughts they bring to mind, while the music really swings, even in the slower tempo songs.I know the Ballad Essentials series was meant as introductory records, but trust me, for the best sample of the most unsung singer in history, take it Sweet & Slow!\n\nAnswer:",

But when constrained to three minutes, sans editors or their own self-editing,their mini-speeches show a whole new side to well-known writers. This book is all ups ands and down. Some clever, some confusedand wandering. Best you use Amazon's Look Inside Feature to sample these ninety-second wonders or wanderers.Nice spread of top talents though; you might like to read the candid thoughts of writing celebs, focussed or consciously rapids-streamed. For my taste (and these are real subjective nuggets) there are more ups and downs. This I'd call one-time-throughreading. (And yes, no power on earth could stop some writers from running over their three minutes. Now, this isn't chauvinistic,but this seemingly holds truest for women writers.)\n\nAnswer:",

Only I say that exists a \"relativity\" between two albums and is possible to explore this aspect(Observe: \"...electromagnetic force...\" in Speed of Love!).
