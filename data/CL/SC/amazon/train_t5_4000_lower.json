It prints pretty fast but the ink is really light sometimes. The tray on it broke right away with minimal use also.\n\nAnswer:",

His rendition of this song leads me to believe that the American Idol producers were afraid to let him and Clay sing the same songs for fear that Clay would give far superior performances of the songs. Can you imagine Clay singing this song?? Would have suited his voice much better!\n\nAnswer:",

It took a while for me to get into the book. About half way through is when it all comes together. Typical Koontz introducing the characters and it is all needed background but just long winded. The middle to the end of the book is when I couldn't put it down. Wonderful ending and the last half of the book was the best part of this book.

The case feels very nice and it fits very well and the grip on the two sides makes the note much easier to hold compared to it w/o since it is so slippery. However, there are issues w/ the case. I cannot charge my phone when I use the case because of the way the charger port is cut. Also, I would have press the power button extremely hard in order to hit it. But for what I paid, I guess its not too bad. I would recommend the case maybe I just got a lemon...\n\nAnswer:",

When I first bought this as an record album I wore the vinyl down until the grooves were dull and flat. Now with the CD version that same excellent sound is there. This album shows more range of the group then any of ELO's other albums. This album was the turning point of the group from Classic Rock with violins too Pop-rock and the high tech sound, like in their albums Discovery and Time. To know Electric Light Orchestra you need to own this album, Out of the Blue.\n\nAnswer:",

The book, \"The Islamic Connection\" is an excellent resource for educators. Whether teaching history, mathematics or a course on human studies, this book will assist instructors in opening the minds of their students.

Now you are choosing to not release just part 2 of season one, but you are going to release the entire season? Relaly not okay. Terrible customer service. YOu know that people will buy part 2 if they already purchased part one.Come on people, just not okay.Oh, and if you think that people are over-reacting because you plan to release season one part 2, then don't make announcements like this. Just stupid. Terrible.\n\nAnswer:",

I wanted to hear more about what the lessons she learned from her experiences and observations as well as applications for the future. I did not want to hear that instead of shopping I could \"color in a coloring book with crayons\".

This book is a dynamic book, meaning that the page is sized for the text. The problem with this feature is twofold. First, the parts lists are difficult to reference quickly.

It would be a great Kindle feature if you could choose between standard book layout styled print and dynamic pages (depending on your personal preference or quality of eyesight).

The water is more soft now than hard before, which i can i feel in the look of my hair. My hair is more soft and lushly now.

If I didn't have the cable bent just right, the sound in one or both ears would drop out. It's a shame because they sound so much better than the phones that came with my Zune. But I guess at $10 or whatever I paid for it, there's not much I can complain about. Great sound though, and inexpensive.\n\nAnswer:",

Also, I liked the fact that there is a mole and that someone right next to you could destroy the whole game. However, the interactive games and such used to get more clues are not made well. Though you try to do what it tells you to do, it doesn't seem to work. Since these interactive parts are so simple, yet not made in a way that one can control what is going on, you waste your time trying to do them and you never get to the end. I had three college students and two adults try it adn no one could seem to get it to work correctly. So, if some bugs were worked out, this game could be a much bigger success.\n\nAnswer:",

This book is great at that, but I was very disappointed to find that the thin brochure has very poor layout - like a printed word document bound into paperback. And no figures are included at all, although they are mentioned in text. A list of Montessori tools is also useless without figures and illustrations, because one can not visualise what the text is describing. So, all in all, this does not help a parent in actually working the Montessori way - this is more or less just a chain of thoughts that are behind the method.

Bottom line...Avoid any dive knife with plastic parts. At least make sure they are not part of the structural components of the knife. On the other hand I love the Kydex sheath design, especially the straps that are made for quick release. Makes for easy on/off. Over all, if you are going to go with Kershaw, go for the Amphibian. Same sheath, better knife.\n\nAnswer:",

It laser prints well. My only complaint is that it doesn't take ink pens well. It is very slippery to write on and medium ink pens register only a very thin line (if you can get the ball rolling at all). The ink from gel type pens never seems to dry and will smear big time, even after a several minutes. A sharpie is really your only alternative. Use this stuff for permanent finalized work.\n\nAnswer:",

I tried the product twice and my hair never turned blonde. I had to run out and get my hair professionally dyed in order to be blonde for my TV role. What a disappointment! It says on the bottle that it covers gray. Well, it does not!!!\n\nAnswer:",

However, I quickly found it jammed when printing, and thus you had to reprint, eating up the tape quicker, which is not cheap. Also, I recall it requires a lot of batteries, which seem to be exhausted quickly, compared to other things I have that use far fewer batteries, like digital cameras. So, it became an expensive item to maintain (printing tape and batteries), which i got tired of doing. So I soon replaced it with a Brother, which has neither problem.\n\nAnswer:",

It starts off with a small section on motion and the human bone and muscle system, then moves into detail on action moves such as running and walking from many different angles. The bulk of this book is on battle moves, and they have a ton to show you. Everything from chops and punches to roundhouses and elbow strikes is right in this book from many different angles. The only reason I gave this book four instead of five stars is because I really think they could have gone into more detail on the muscle systems, and there are no weapons in this book. Although they show it on the cover, they don't show how to animate your characters with weapons. A small downside, but it still is a great book to learn many different types of action especially battle moves.\n\nAnswer:",

As for the historical fiction aspect of the book, it wasn't anything out of the ordinary. If you are looking for a bible story where women are treated like animals, this is the book for you. If you are looking for a historical perspective on the time period, this is not the right book.\n\nAnswer:",

I'm a \"conflict to happy ending\" type of book reader and this was DEFINITELY not the book for me. But it was somewhat enlightening.\n\nAnswer:",

Also, they have four presets for each part, and not a way for you to design a totally new saucer. As aforementioned, since there is no cross bredding, you cannot make a new class.

It appears that there is a little flaw in the casting where the V-groove is not deep enough on one of the bases. I belive that I can grind it out with a dremel but wished to contact Moen for warrenty info 1st.Here's where the rub comes. I contacted Moen a couple months ago via Email with no response. We finally called them this week only to find out that Amazon.com is not an \"authorized\" dealer so there is no warrenty. I guess that I'm going to hope that that I can repair the base and not have to purchase another from an authorized dealer - so much for the savings!!\n\nAnswer:",

I absolutely loved Prospero's Children, and I enjoyed Dragon Charmer, but I thought the author kind of gave up on this one. I really enjoyed Fern's strong character in the other books, but she seemed weak in the Witch Queen. The author had a good idea, but didn't follow through. The ending especially was not only a letdown, but also violated my idea of fair play in books. It was almost as if the author just got bored and couldn't think of ANY other way to end it. Without giving away too much, I think that's all that I can safely say.Just a warning, Witch Queen is not of the same calibre as Ms. Siegal's other books.\n\nAnswer:",

Turn up the brightness of your hd tv.sit back and shut up & enjoy the movie. No it's nothing like the theater version of 3D that I agree, but this is tv folks and by the way, at it's best. If you were honest on your own review than you do know that when you purchased this 3D version it came with a 2d version as well. I never once heard those people mention that in there reviews. Hmm makes me wonder if they ever purchased the Blu ray version..I ejoyed it in 3D as well. It is what it is. A great movie in 3D and in 2DIf your not happy with the 3D, than plop in the disc 2 and watch it in 2D, it's just that simple folks! Watch it and become a kid again!\n\nAnswer:",

Of course, this is the Americanized version of the true Japanese story, but it is, by all means, a fair account.

Not great but not horrible. When it works the way I want to, the blades cut pretty well, and close. However, the main and largest problem is the 5-blade design. With the blades so close together, hair easily gets clogged between them, requiring more work to take out and clean. And clean you must, since it's hard to continue shaving when there's hair worsening the blades' gliding/cutting performance. As for the other users who love this razor, maybe its for some people and not for others (like me), or maybe my hair is too thick. Whatever the case, I recommend you to try this 5-blade razor out before you commit to buying the extra blades.\n\nAnswer:",

This one is more of a meditation and relaxation video than a workout video. Most people say the segments are each 20 minutes long, but that's only if you do all of the meditation. The workouts are actually 13 minutes for the AM and 18 minutes for the PM. The other video I purchased has so much more to offer with more than one routine and much more length. If you don't want to spend a lot of time working out, press stop when you're ready. This video is over before you know it. In addition, the PM section wakes you up more than the AM, so I'd reverse the order when using. Definitely go for a Bryan Kest video.\n\nAnswer:",

I never heard any other of their previous albums and after listening to this one, I don't really have the desire to do so. It is true that Sum 41 copied a lot of other bands on Chuck but that doesn't really matter to me. If a band plays good and makes good music I don't really care how or from who they got their ideas. I didn't really like the album mostly becuase I don't like their style of music. Almost all the tracks sound the same, you can't tell one from another. Also, most of the tracks have beats that are too fast for my liking. I only enjoyed 4 tracks on the album: 5, 8, 11, 12. Personally I like Yellowcard's Ocean Avenue much better.\n\nAnswer:",

It works very nicely, though I sometimes nearly burn myself when carrying the mug with hot water when I'm not careful. The glass gets hot very quickly, and the handle is small. Similarly, when I remove the infuser from the mug, there is not an easy way to do so without touching the hot metal. If you're interested in this style infuser, which I am convinced produces superior tea to ball or spoon infusers, go for it. You might also consider purchasing just the infuser and using it with your favorite mug instead.\n\nAnswer:",

Set was supposed to come with 72 pieces and we only got 68. There is not enough pieces to complete the activity cards, even if we did get the 72 pieces. For example: On many activity cards, 3 'charactors' of the same color are needed and only 2 of each color was provided and there are 6 different colors. In short, this set is useless if using it with coordinating Activity Cards. I would also say this set is too big and chunky for kids 4 years old and up. I'll be sending Activity Cards and Count and Sort Set back to Amazon. Disappointed.\n\nAnswer:",

Some elements seem to be there just to pad things out, others are actually quite interesting takes on the original plots.

My son cried endlessly, especially when Elmo bent over laughing and touched my son's leg. He pushed Elmo away and was scared to have him nearby. I was a bit nervous he was scarred for life and wouldn't want elmo again, but once we turned him off and put him aside, he reluctantly gave Elmo a hug. Anyway- bottom line is don't get too crazy about this toy if you can't find it. My son would have loved any Elmo just as much, and probably would prefer one that didn't \"attack\" him.\n\nAnswer:",

I had saw the movie some time ago, but found the book to be more in-depth, as most books are. Not my favorite of Mr. Baldaccis, but a thriller none the less. Luther, the star early on, passes the torch to Jack and Det. Frank. The events towards the end made up for the few lulls in the middle. Strong characters, Sullivans, Baldwins, the law firm make for an overall good read. The corruption at the top of the governmental scale was very evident and interesting. As I say I enjoyed it, and look forward to \"Wish you well\" by Mr. Baldacci.\n\nAnswer:",

A large Group of people used to gather almost everyday to sit around and just drink. People in the story were always concerned about their self. All they thought about was sex and how they needed it all of the time. I thought Jake, the main character and the narrator, shouldn't have had to go through what he went through; .He didn't deserve all that. Jake was an innocent man who just wanted on thing, and that was Brett.This novel is very similar to modern day times. Sometimes people engage in drinking just to get away from their everyday struggles.. The time in which this novel took place and now times are similar in ways. In both the characters in the novel and people now-a-days, turn to alcohol for relief and have tendencies to party all night long. Yet, there are parts in the book I cannot believe can occur, but this may be a good part of the novel; A place where dreams may happen.\n\nAnswer:",

I guess what I really love about Ani is her ability to take a simple melody, add a bunch of different instrumentals, creative lyrics, her emotional voice, some really unique chords and key changes and turn it into something complex, but not grating. I felt like only 2 songs on this album did that: Studying Stones and Paradigm. The rest of the tracks, I just didn't enjoy listening to because I didn't like the melodies. I don't have all of her albums (I have 8, I think) but this is the first one where I don't absolutely love at least 2/3 of the songs.

It is especially useful if you plan to drive, as it occasionally mentions hotels with garages and gives detailed information on certain routes.Buy Bradt for the guide, but Lonely Planet Venezuela for the maps.\n\nAnswer:",

I also realized I was probably shortening my life by spending it hunched over the computer. But I work online. Solution? Opted to get aFitDesk(a.k.a., exercise bike with a laptop desk attached). Only problem was, the seat was not especially kind to my now-ample backside. I tried and tried to woman up, to no avail. Fortunately a seat adapter came out for the FitDesk, and I jumped on this baby. I was a little worried that even this would not endear me to long stretches on the bike, but it's just what I needed. For an upright bike design, there's no bumping of the thighs, and at last my new pas-de-deux with gravity is bearable. Ahhh.\n\nAnswer:",

Most of the other reviewers have summed up the plot well, so I won't do that, but I DO want to say that I was really offended by the racial slur used to describe the character Ron (well, describing his accent) towards the end of the book. I re-read the paragraph over and over to see if it really said that. I can only guess Mr. Fromm, the author was trying to convey Lucy's disgust for this character. This could have been done without that expression. Shame on Mr. Fromm and his editors for letting a racist expression, which added nothing to the story, into the book!\n\nAnswer:",

The writing is very confusing. You have to read the book a few times to find the very simple things he wants to say.

With TV prices and technological advances, this LCD should be no more than $600 - $700 if you think about it. I would totally wait for prices to drop or for new models to come out.

The book is basically composed of paragraphs with very little use figures, tables, exhibits, etc. It's just paragraph after paragraph. My biggest issue with this book, however, was the fact that I had to constantly skip the inline citations that were everywhere! One example: a 4 sentence paragraph with 3 citations. It was very distracting to read and it took away the focus from the material to, instead, reading last names and years. I do not recommend this book whatsoever.\n\nAnswer:",

Most of the birds are no longer in use, but some are still flying and will be flying on the 50th anniversary of the plane. It began as an all-weather fleet defense interceptor for the US Navy, but will be remembered most as the mainstay of the Air Force operations in Vietnam.This book is the exhaustively researched records of what happened to each of the planes that were built. It includes the McDonnell build information and more on the planes lives. Most of the data is in tabular form, you can't put too much about each of the 5,000 planes in only 360 pages.And of the 360 pages, about sixty of them are beautiful four color photographs showing more imaginative paint jobs than you can imagine.This book is going to remain the definitive report on the construction and operational use of the F-4.\n\nAnswer:",

If you need a tele lens and you are on a budget, then get the 70-300 for $100 more and get more tele power.It does not work if you use it as one fits all lengs.

Instead of mimicking the tried-and-true journalistic voice of authority, the author lets his subject do most of the talking, about baseball in general and the Red Sox in particular, as well as on things that have little to do with sport but are nonetheless interesting, such as the Ramsey murder, life in the Army during the Vietnam era, race, and psychology. In one lengthy passage, the author uses old and new James analysis to make a case for Lou Whitaker being severly underrated and having had more value to his teams than Ernie Banks or Lou Brock to theirs. Whether you agree or disagree, or you like Bill James or don't, this book is pretty fascinating. Some reviewers have complained about the structure, but I found it a fun and easy read.

This little boy is sweet, innocent, and hates that there parents kill so Tiffany makes a pac with Chucky to stop killing for good. Do they finally stop? Also Chucky and Tiffany don't know what there kid is... a boy or a girl? what do you think? Jenifer Tilly plays the voice od Tiffany and she plays herself, a actress.The dolls looks better becuase they get a makeover. It's really funny and I liked it.\n\nAnswer:",

I used several of the colors in the book and they looked wonderful on my walls. This is one of the few paint books that I have bought that actually provide the brand and color names. It is extremely frustrating to pick up decorating books or magazines, find a color that's appealing and then find no reference to the brand or color name. This book actually provides three different paint brands to pick from for each color. I also really liked her descriptions of different color combinations and the feelings (restful, cozy, bright) that goes along with the different colors. The price is reasonable so even if you don't use the colors in the book, its a great place to get ideas. I highly recommend this book. I hope she releases another!\n\nAnswer:",

The story, itself, is a nice idea. Finding a message about a man's undying love for his wife would get most women and their libidos racing to find \"man with love expressive language.\" You can ask most single women, and I guess married ones too, how often they hear a man express his love, passionately, to them or anyone else. The answer will probably not surprise you so, when a woman senses this in a man, even if he is expressing it for another woman, said woman will want it, at any cost. Sparks mixes his metaphors, and continued to ignore the verb-object agreement. For the most part, the book read like it was done by a first-time, romance novelist.\n\nAnswer:",

Record companies shouldn't make singles with only 2 songs. They should have at least four. The cost of buying this isn't worth it. As of now, it's $4.99 new. If the album is what, maybe 12 dollars, that means 2 1/2 of these cost about the same amount as the album. That's only 6 tracks, when you can get (I think it's) 13 tracks on the album. \"Get it poppin\" is a r&b track, that sounds like it came from her first album. I'm sorry, \"Get It Poppin\" is good, but it's just not good enough for you to fork over all that cash. Not to mention shipping.\n\nAnswer:",

There were parts of it that didn't really make sense to me, like how Morgaine, who is in most cases called the Fairy, was against fairies. But there were also parts that were fully engrossing and I really enjoyed. To me, it read like a first draft. It was, however, one of the few King Arthur stories that I could stand to read all the way through. I would have liked to see Arylwren as a slightly more flawed character- she seemed too perfect and benign to be true, while everyone else was a bit of a mess. I think it had gaps, as well.

He describes his slow transformation from stanch athiest to devout Christian in the complicated simplicity that only Lewis can achieve. However, be weary of this book if you have never previously read Lewis. The development of the story is rather slow and lethargic and the non-Lewis fan may find it difficult to get through the early chapters. Yet, for the Lewis admirer the lax early chapters are well worth the culminating transformation in the late portion.\n\nAnswer:",

I'm only 5'2, I can't imagine this would work for a tall person. I'm also thin, size 6... The pillow wraps around me and hits the chair back behind me, leaving a huge gap between my waist and the pillow, leaving baby unsupported too.

I would try the breast friend pillow instead, if I get a hold of one cheap, I'll update this review to compare the pillows?Update:Brest friend pillow is much more supportive.

NOT! Largely autobiographical, and including many mundane details of the lives of her boring friends, the book gives no sense of her growth as a person, a serious weakness in personal anecdotal material. Ms. Powers also lacks a sense of history, or the logical facility to come to conclusions based on facts and comparisons. Everything simply IS. The only rule seems to be that Nothing, and no one, is subject to any kind of judgement. Oh, I've thought of a second rule that has been applied - different is rule 1. Anything \"same\" is uncool.

This is a nice enough flavor, but it is not really like a more traditional genmaicha which has the flavors of both the toasted rice plus the green tea.I prefer either the Yamamotoyama or the Coffee Bean and Tea Leaf company versions of genmaicha for commercially available sources.

I thought it would be a nice art book--good illustrations, etc., but the illustrations are very boring and the book is very tiny. It has good information, but it's not real interesting---it's like studying for a course in college with a dry book with no pictures. It came highly recommended to me, so maybe I'm under-rating it, but I just thought it would be a much nicer book. As I said, no reflection on seller---my problem because I read the reviews and bought the book. Just one of those things. I would not recommend it to my fellow art friends. I'll loan them this one, but certainly wouldn't recommend they buy this for that much money.\n\nAnswer:",

I received it in my home, shipped from Amazon on May 8th, 2007, Yesterday on July 26, 2007, IT DIED! I paid, $129. Anyway, I call Amazon, and they SUCK! 30 days is all they cover, after that YOU are on your OWN. I don't know what has happened to them, I am not going to use them anymore. Not to mention the guy in Customer Service couldn't speak English and Understand me. NOT his fault, but frusterating all the same. I know they could care less if I shop with them or not, obviously due to the way I was treated. Anyway, It worked Awesome for 3 short months. What ever you do, if you must purchase this item, don't buy it from amazon, as they don't back what they sell for more than 30 days. Good Luck to you All.\n\nAnswer:",

Please trust me, or just play the sound samples and hear for yourself. This is bootleg quality. Hot Wacks would rate this good to very good soundboard at best. A great tracklist & decent performance from Iggy are not enough to recommend this.

Most of this film is spent watching one guy go about his business, as he is slowly turning into a zombie. The film never seems to go anywhere,and for something to come out under Fangoria's banner, you would think there would be more horror to the story, but unfortunately there isn't. Boring, boring, boring, is the best I can say about it. Very little special effects. Mostly just on his zombie makeup. This is one movie I couldn't reccomend to anyone.\n\nAnswer:",

I have this litter box in titanium, and I think it's as attractive as an indoor outhouse can possibly be. The lid is excellent at keeping flying litter in so far, and it's roomy enough for my 9 month old cat. My kids ripped and flung a few things in their excitement to get all set up for the new kitty, and so the charcoal filter went uninstalled for a few days. Sadly, I can honestly say I notice no difference at all in the level of odor after installing the filter. And no difference at all between the odor from this box and the small cheap-o open box we had at first.That said, I'd still buy it again for the sleek look, compact size and the nice enclosure. I wasn't really expecting it to smell good-- it's a box full of leavings, after all-- but I definitely expected it to contain the litter. And at that it's doing a great job.\n\nAnswer:",

The numbers are all in the book. A caution ... the low calorie version of the diet has not resulted in much weight loss.

I didn't know much about the authorship controversy before reading this book, but I found the theories explored both easy to follow and ultimately intriguing.

Considering that fact, this DVD is excellent. Regarding the content of the program, the DVD includes all original episodes from the VAS series; without editing.

You can vary the pitch from a high and loud noise, to a lower pitch. It does not create the low sound of a large standing fan on low speed, so if your ears are sensitive to high pitched noises this may not be for you. I noticed at the higher level I wake with a ringing in the ear, but I have had that disorder for sometime now and this is why a small fan didn't work well for me. There are two speeds on the machine. With the unit I received I have to run it on high speed for a while before I switch it to low speed. For some reason it does not start out well on low speed.

This blu-ray version has some pluses, the first being how visually clear it is and how vibrant the colors are. It is definitely an up-grade from any standard DVD I have seen. Another plus are the featurettes, one on Gene Kelly which is well done and another on the making of this particular film. Both are very interesting. The only disappointment is the 1:33:1 format - or a standard format. This is a film which should have been done in widescreen - especially the dance sequence at the end. We are so spoiled by all the new productions of musicals in widescreen that it is too bad that this one was done before its time. However, lovers of Gene Kelly and musicals will most likely enjoy having this version in their collection.\n\nAnswer:",

I think that would hold up much better.2) The two sides are held together by a small piece of velcro. This leaves the sides open to wear dust/dirt can get in.

I laughed so hard over this that it was hard to be disgusted with the whole mess! Why on earth would The Dixie Chicks give a darn if someone chose to smash up their pirated cds??? They received no money for those rip-offs in the first place! As a very loyal fan who BUYS the cds as soon as they come out, that really just struck me as a hoot!\n\nAnswer:",

I always looked forward to a new release by Ms. Howard and would gladly shell out the price for a hard cover. The last two releases left me disappointed to say the least. Cover of Night was just awful, the plot was way beyond realistic. Ms. Howard must have had enough typed to satisfy her editor or to fill up a specific number of pages because the book just ends with a very hurried explanation. The same can be said for her two books prior to this one. Needless to say Ms. Howard has lost a fan.

But as I purchased this product for the program itself, it is only a slight dip for me.

This book was highly original in the power of magicians. It's not just like using magic to do everything and being in secret from non-magic people. the structure of it is cool because of the way it has two main charaxters and switches views. Since magicians don't actually use magic, (they summon demons and the stronger the demon, the harder he is to control so you need to be a strong magician to control strong demons) Bartimeaus is actually the one with all the power, not Nathaniel (the magician).

While it fills time between Murakami books, I find both strength and weakness in its form (a story told through a series of letters exchanged by former spouses who have been apart for 10 years). The problem with writing a book in the form of letters is: 1. the author's need to maintain proper writing (grammar, punctuation etc.) at the expense of the character's natural writing style (are they both such perfect writers? we'll never know); and 2. the hard-to-ignore fact (perhaps just in this case) that the letters are indeed written by the same person (the author).

If you resize the images you want to load to 720X480 pixels (or thereabouts) using, for example, Photoshop Elements, you can get as many as 70-90 images on the device.

Compounding these simple errors were stilted classical allusions that seemed either incredibly obscure or incorrect.As a neophyte, I gained a fair bit of information on the War and the primary actors.

Next is a cover of the flipper track sacrifice, which sound incredible sung by buzz.The only let down from this album is the fairly mediocre With Teeth.

It became tiring and annoying to wade through some of the more descriptive passages of the story while waiting for something useful to happen or some progress in the story.

While AKNF was just like any other pop-punk album, DTLI incorporates metal, and skate punk into the songs. Everything is better on this CD than the other one. The vocals aren't whiney, and there is some pretty cool guitar riffs and solos. The lyrics were pretty good. Nothing special though. I would compare their sound NOFX or Pennywise.

The musical style of [The]Caseworker is completely original and it shows. Trying to describe the sound the band has on this album would do it no justice. Extremely chill cuts with melodic beats and chords, to the faint lyrics that put you into a trance. Completely soothing yet dark at the same time. Most would classify this as indy rock, as would I.However, they are in their own category and rightly so. Track 4 is the only cut I don't care for on this album. The abrasive sound of track 4 is a completely seperate sound from the rest of the album. This album is a must have for ANY collection.I listen to this CD at least once a day...and so should you.

The thermostat also gives you the current temperature, which is also very convenient.I've also own two 1000 watt Zilla thermostats, and I prefer the Hydrofarm over the Zilla for two reasons: (1) Hydorfarm's is digital, which makes setting an exact temperature possible, and (2) it displays the current temperature.

So, hence my call to customer service for an replacement. I, of course, finally figured out once I received the new shipment that, \"IT\" was only a house-shaped box & extras DVD.

This is a \"must-have\" for all Star Trek fans. The sound remix is awesome. Many scenes were cut out, and many scenes were added. Some new special effects were added in just the right places. I thought the original version had too much lighting - that too was fixed. I can now watch this movie over and over again without getting bored! The bonus features were great as well. I especially enjoyed finally hearing the story on Star Trek:Phase II (The series that almost was). The Director's edition-DVD crew deserves a big round of applause!\n\nAnswer:",

The novel is not nearly as imaginative as you would believe, given the premise of the story itself. Aside from the circus setting, this is a very conventional book story-wise. Which isn't necessarily a problem, except that the author attempts to stretch the story beyond what it is, often falling way too in love with her writing and going on for long, descriptive asides that lead nowhere. Ultimately, the story is tied together by a very abrupt and rushed ending. Just very unsatisfying. Not horrible but was a disappointment since there is so much critical acclaim tied to this novel.\n\nAnswer:",

The first problem is the pop up trimmer, on the Arcitec it is useless. When I need one I always go to the 5801XL. The second problem is that sometimes I don't shave on weekends so Monday mornings with the Arcitec the job gets only half done and I have to finish up with the older model. I was going to buy new blades for the Arcitec but decided to spring for a Speed XL instead. Sorry Philips Norelco but for me your flagship model has hit an iceberg.\n\nAnswer:",

The text is OK, but the illustrations are terrible. It is done in a cartoon manner, but it makes the soldiers of the Civil War look like a bunch of buffoons. I know the idea is to appeal to young boys--but this book goes too far. On one page dead soldiers are laying in a battlefield--their butts are up in the air and they look more drunk than dead. Scenes depicting amputations are made to look humerous. This is no way to present history. Kids are already de-sensitized to violence, and this book makes it look funny.

However, there are a couple of things to note about this book:1.) The description claims that there are many examples in each chapter. That is simply not true if you consider 1 trivial example for each section to be \"many\" examples. My professor kindly reminded me that pretty pictures and examples can be found in undergraduate vibrations books. Also, the matlab code in the book is not available anywhere online or on disk. This makes using the programs rather tedious.2.) The binding came unglued the first week I owned it which is really annoying since I dropped approximately 1 billion dollars on the thing.

There is also the possibility that she, as a writer, has edited her version of the past as a protection for someone or atonement for something.That said, this is not your standard Barnard mystery, with deliciously nasty characters and a real puzzler that only resolves in the last few lines.

Eddie Lane provides some points that should be considered for the church or religious group trying to minister to Black men. The author expounds upon issues which have contributed to the lack of men in the church. He provides a variety of illustrations that clearly and concisely show the points he is making. I recommend this book as valuable tool for helping to teach on men and as tool for developing further outreach. Other recommended reading - \"Reclaiming the Urban Family\" by Willie Richardson.\n\nAnswer:",

Perhaps it was the concept of the film. Or me imagining that happening to me what was happening to Drew Barrymore's character. Whatever it was, it kept me from enjoying the movie. I did not really find it sweet or cute or funny in any way. It was just odd. I know that people do experience such an awful form of memory loss, but to me, that makes a good dramatic film. Not a romantic comedy. I mean, I can understand why people would wish to make light of the situation and make it romantic and whatnot, but for me, it didn't work.

I have only been using the switch for a month, but so far, all three inputs are working perfectly.The switch is moderately sized and should easily fit into your existing setup. Up to a maximum of three devices can be hooked up simultaneously to the switch. A fourth optical cable will be needed to attach to your receiver or whatever device you are routing your sound through.The cables snap in tightly and the switch itself locks into place on the input you have selected. Since there is no power cord required, installation should take only minutes. If your AV equipment is lacking a suitable number of inputs, this switch will enable you to hook everything up quickly and easily.\n\nAnswer:",

The story is fascinating, and, if one needs a brief look at the (mainly) military side of events early in the war, this book can be useful. Beginning about mid-way through 1775, the story works through its title year and early 1777, providing a clear picture of the difficulties Washington and his Continental soldiers experienced. However, most of the research comes from published sources, with a couple of notable exceptions, and some battles, for example, White Plains, are glossed over so quickly one best not blink.

But honestly, I have a hard time seeing how she is doing anything of eternal value. As it is, this is a passing fad where we've chosen to celebrate a teen who can put a commercialized web site together instead of recognizing the students in our world who are making lasting impacts through overseas and local service projects in their communities. If Ashley gets the spotlight simply because Sprite.com is a sponsor, I have to wonder what we are really encouraging - a meaningless chase after the wind? Or perhaps the better question is what are we discouraging? Give me a teen who's making a selfless impact instead so they might feel encouraged to keep on keeping on. Ashley Power, meanwhile, can have Levis Jeans.\n\nAnswer:",

He will take care of you. Don't rely on your own strength and wisdom, but rather, His. No matter how painful an event in our life is, it is there for a reason. Usually, it brings us closer to God because we are forced by our weakness to come to Him for strength. I truly recommend this book to anyone who is hurting and who is dissatisfied with life. I also really enjoyed the quotes written before each chapter that serve as a preview of the lesson to be learned in that chapter.\n\nAnswer:",

It is an excellent collection of data and photographs of the Minesweepers and Armed yachts of the USN in WWII. While it contains no service records of the vessels concerned, it has many technical readouts of a very varied collection of very necessary ships. No WWII navy got by without buying and requistioning a collection of Yachts, many of which performed valuable roles in the naval war. In addition, it also contains the readouts of the Minesweepers of the USN. A minesweeper is a minimal ship, whose purpose is to find and render useless a very ugly naval weapon. They didn't get much glory, but they did save many lives. Sadly you don't get any deck plans, and there is no index, but a lot of good stuff is found between these covers.\n\nAnswer:",

I recently purchased the Poulan Pro PP125 and it works good. Attached the edger to the trimmer right out of the box. The edger works fine but it takes a few minutes (and sparks) to get the hang of it, especially if your area has not been edged in awhile. but on pre-edged surfaces it works great. The attachment does make it a little heavy on the end, especially if you are a tall person (I'm 6'3\" and it gave my back a good workout). I've been edging with a string BlacknDecker trimmer the past 5 years and wish I had switched long time ago. Make sure you tighten the thumb screw on the \"U\" handle of the trimmer, as it will move with the weight of this attachment. All in all, this thing works good, and looks good too.\n\nAnswer:",

It will explain with documented cited sourced facts and information as to why \"baby wise\" parenting is wrong and harmful to your child. NO babies are the same and there is no \"way\" or \"schedule\" that a child is set to follow. Babies espeacily those that are breast feed want to suckle not only for substance but for comfort a feeling of closeness that they shared with you in the womb, why deny them of that? CIO that's a good way for your child to mistrust you. Crying is the way children communicate and for a parent not to respond to a childs cries demeans the child. How can a parent listen to thier little one cry, your little one simply wants to be with you, again why deny them of that.

First because of quality, and second, because they were extremely lightweight. On first appearance, the present product looks very similar to what I used in the past - especially when viewed on the internet. However, when the product arrived, it was considerably heavier than past shoes I've purchased. The sole is now molded to the upper shoe, so that when the soles wear out, the shoes are basically finished. Prior Rockports were easily resoled due to how they were constructed. The present product is okay, but I will need to see and handle any further shoes before buying. I will keep this pair to see how they handle in the long run.\n\nAnswer:",

Making such a big deal (book) out of so small a chapter seemed somewhat lame, to me.Overall, Queen Sayoko is both funny and charming, with the slightest hint of romance.

The book is definitely a guilty pleasure. Fans of Jacqueline Susann and Jackie Collins will, undoubtedly, enjoy this book.\n\nAnswer:",

The plot devices were no longer credible, even given the suspension of disbelief inherent to this type of book.My hypothesis is that Crichton was thinking of the big screen when he wrote this book.

It's a bad game and the developer is hoping it will sell because of its sex appeal and intense amounts of gore. Don't be fooled, this game is going to be a mediocre (at best) action game. The game is basically a rip off Max Payne, Devil May Cry 2, and Blood Omen: Legacy of Kain with a lot more gore, sex appeal, and the gameplay doesn't nearly match up to the games it is \"ripping off\" from. The gameplay is supposivly very similar to Resident Evil. Although I love Resident Evil, this game is a fast paced action game and RE's controls are better suited for survival-horror..not action.Remember..there are lots of games out there with a lot of sex/gore appeal but that doesn't make them all good. Some such as Grand Theft Auto: Vice City, BMX XXX, Resident Evil, or Mortal Kombat:Deadly Alliance (trust me, it will sincerely be a good game) will be good but others such as BloodRayne are just trash.\n\nAnswer:",

When two girls insulted Apple he frowned, and when Heather was patting or riding him, he smiled. It was cute, but sort of weird.Not counting the inacuracy of the horse facts and illustrations, it was a very cute book. Girls between six and ten would love it.

Even to dismiss dialogs between quarters you must use the mouse or keyboard. I can't start a game, kick back on my beanbag and play, I need to sit at my desk so I can keep the mouse within reach. If I had known this before I bought the game, I would have bought the PS2 version.\n\nAnswer:",

After a long time on the phone with customer service, they admitted that with the new FCC rules the transmitter signal is too weak to give good sound on many radios. You have to get the system hardwired to get it to work correctly.Tip - call customer service and complain long and hard enough that it was false advertising and eventually they will agree to sending you the hardwire kit for free and also credit your account $30 dollars for the approx cost of getting it installed.

The batteries, when used in conjunction with the nunchuk, have a slim battery life of just over 2 hours average. The color of the batteries does not match the plastic of the controllers, and the stickers on the batteries leave a terrible residue.The plus side? If you intend to use the two batteries together, one at a time while the other charges, then this should be fine, as each battery will last longer than the time taken to charge the other battery. Design is nice, snaps well into wiimote, although quite tight for constant removal and reinsertion. Cheaper than batteries regardless for the lightweight gamers like me, who hate having the batteries die when they only play an hour or two a day, at most.\n\nAnswer:",

I really like both of the actors in this movie. And to describe some of the scenes to my friends, you would think it was a hilarious movie. So I'm pretty sure the writing was good, but the execution was off. The timing and the passion never seemed to click. Maybe having Downey Jr. as the straight guy was the problem. He seemed more mean that funny. Mean can be funny if given proper attention - Dr. Evil is quite funny, but he was vulnerable too. Downey's vulnerable side seemed fake so you never really cared about the character. Comedy is surely one of the hardest forms of acting to capture on film - you really have to commit to the character and the scene. This movie and the actors never really did that. There were a few funny moments, but in all it was a rather dull ride. What a shame. I really wanted to like this movie. Two popular actors cashing a check. That's all.\n\nAnswer:",

I would recommend this book to anyone that is mature enough for the contents. Thompson may be no \"Hemingway,\" but he has a knack of giving us a different perspective, as valid as it is skewed. Perhaps this is key, to understand and survive in a mixed up world one must be mixed up.

The handles are my main concern and for the price. When I pick up a heavy cut of meat, the small handle torques the wrist, a longer handle allows some of the weight to be placed on the fore-arm like a fishing pole. The wood on mine has dark stripping imbedded in them like it was made from water damaged wood. \"EZ-Hook\" has much longer hardwood handles and are made in the USA. I will be ordering these for my future gifts to grillers.\n\nAnswer:",

I need a vacuum bottle that is durable, and that will easily fit into my grip. This bottle fills the bill in that department, but after a couple of months, this bottle has started losing it's heat retaining capabilities. I took it out of my grip (bag) the other day, and the whole outside of the bottle was very warm. The coffee inside was lukewarm, and I did the preheating stuff beforehand. This is my fourth Stanley bottle, and I will NEVER buy one of these again. They all start out great, and get worse as you use them. I have since ordered a Thermos/Nissan Work Series Thermos Beverage Bottle - (40 oz.). These are hands down better than anything Stanley makes. I got mine from [...]. The Stanley bottle has great potential, but the company needs to figure out how to insulate it!!\n\nAnswer:",

They are good. For newbies, it will let them learn how cool the wiimote really is, and for a group it will keep them entertained, but its not a game to play by yourself.Games like tank, billiard and laser hockey are amusing; find mii, fishing and racing (on a cow!) feel like a waste of space.Need a wiimote? get itotherwise, I wouldn't recommend it.\n\nAnswer:",

It's bad enough when a product doesn't even last a year, but there is no excuse for poor customer service like that. I will never buy any of their products.

While he doesn't ignore periods entirely, O'Gormans approach is to concentrate on key architectural principles, primarily structural, and use buildings, or even simplified sketches, to illustrate them. The book would have been even better if the glossary at the end were expanded, and used some sketches: words are frequently far less useful than pictures in explaining a term. Also, I found O'Gormans introduction a bit forced and wordy. Conversely, the last few pages of the book, in which he hurriedly covers such topics as the importance of history and association in interpreting architectural work, were fascinating, but rushed.\n\nAnswer:",

There are much better episodes in the show, notably some of the multipart arcs, which made this feel average by comparison. Also, they committed a cardinal filmmaking sin by cutting away in the middle of an action scene and resolving it off-camera with little to no explanation. Considering that this DVD costs almost as much as an entire season of the show, it's hard to give it anything more than a lukewarm recommendation.\n\nAnswer:",

I received my EbookMan this past Friday and spent the weekend attempting to loan the operating system. It never worked as promised. The included installation materials were a joke, the instructions, such as they were, had to be written by a committee of 3 year olds. If you wanted complete documentation, you had to download 150+ pages. Not that it would have helped all that much. By Sunday afternoon, I decided that the EbookMan was not worth the hassle and will send it back to the retailer. Franklin should not have rushed this product out to the public before it was ready. Their reputation will be tarnished and the ebook segment will be hurt again by poor product.\n\nAnswer:",

The one they sent me has one pocket (on the chest), and has a regular \"shirt tails\" hem, like the one you find on a dress shirt, except it falls almost down to my knees. Maybe this was just a mistake, but I am returning it. It looks like maternity wear or something. On a more positive note, the fabric feels nice. I will try and find out why I didn't receive the same shirt as the picture, and get it exchanged, but there wasn't an e-mail address provided with the order, so I am just frustrated and annoyed.\n\nAnswer:",

After about a year now, mine plays half a song and just turns off. The ear phones supplied with it are bad also. And the ear phone plug is touchy. You have to twist the earphone connector just right to hear both ears. Spend an extra $30 and get an mp3 player that has anti-skip technology.\n\nAnswer:",
