I use it in a home business where i do print alot so it gets alot of use. I hate it that if you run out of one color it wont print black and white until you change the color ink. It prints pretty fast but the ink is really light sometimes. The tray on it broke right away with minimal use also.\n\nAnswer:",

Ruben tries to swing through based only on his smooth voice. His rendition of this song leads me to believe that the American Idol producers were afraid to let him and Clay sing the same songs for fear that Clay would give far superior performances of the songs. Can you imagine Clay singing this song?? Would have suited his voice much better!\n\nAnswer:",

It took a while for me to get into the book. About half way through is when it all comes together. Typical Koontz introducing the characters and it is all needed background but just long winded. The middle to the end of the book is when I couldn't put it down. Wonderful ending and the last half of the book was the best part of this book.

The case feels very nice and it fits very well and the grip on the two sides makes the note much easier to hold compared to it w/o since it is so slippery. However, there are issues w/ the case. I cannot charge my phone when I use the case because of the way the charger port is cut. Also, I would have press the power button extremely hard in order to hit it. But for what I paid, I guess its not too bad. I would recommend the case maybe I just got a lemon...\n\nAnswer:",

When I first bought this as an record album I wore the vinyl down until the grooves were dull and flat. Now with the CD version that same excellent sound is there. This album shows more range of the group then any of ELO's other albums. This album was the turning point of the group from Classic Rock with violins too Pop-rock and the high tech sound, like in their albums Discovery and Time. To know Electric Light Orchestra you need to own this album, Out of the Blue.\n\nAnswer:",

It would also have been helpful to have guides between the three rows as the cans often go crooked making it difficult to insert the cans. I definitely would not recommend.\n\nAnswer:",

The book, \"The Islamic Connection\" is an excellent resource for educators. Whether teaching history, mathematics or a course on human studies, this book will assist instructors in opening the minds of their students.

Now you are choosing to not release just part 2 of season one, but you are going to release the entire season? Relaly not okay. Terrible customer service. YOu know that people will buy part 2 if they already purchased part one.Come on people, just not okay.Oh, and if you think that people are over-reacting because you plan to release season one part 2, then don't make announcements like this. Just stupid. Terrible.\n\nAnswer:",

I wanted to hear more about what the lessons she learned from her experiences and observations as well as applications for the future. I did not want to hear that instead of shopping I could \"color in a coloring book with crayons\".

This book is a dynamic book, meaning that the page is sized for the text. The problem with this feature is twofold. First, the parts lists are difficult to reference quickly.

It would be a great Kindle feature if you could choose between standard book layout styled print and dynamic pages (depending on your personal preference or quality of eyesight).

The water is more soft now than hard before, which i can i feel in the look of my hair. My hair is more soft and lushly now.

His music is usually refreshing and sometimes unique or bold. This time it just died. I can always use the Mythodea CD as a reflector for my Christmas tree light. I know ill never listen to it again.\n\nAnswer:",

Both sides of issues should be represented with each side getting an equal voice. We supposedly have a free media in America, but news has a definite slant in one direction or the other. Presenting both sides of an issue is an impossibility even when the networks DO attempt to interview everyone; the network still leaves you in no doubt as to its own opinion. Perhaps we should get androids to report the news instead of anchormen\n\nAnswer:",
