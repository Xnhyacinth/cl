It worked on the mildew but didn't clean the dirt on the shower floor tiles, even with heavy scrubbing. The bleach smell was overwhelming, even with the windows open and a fan going.I decided to try it on some outdoor furniture that was dirty. It didn't really do much except for killing some mossy growth in the corner of one of the chairs. It didn't make much of a difference on the dirt, even with scrubbing. I sprayed the product on the chairs and let them sit for 10 or 15 minutes and tried again. Still didn't touch it.So then I mixed up someChurch & Dwight Co 51516 Oxi Clean Versatile Stain Removeraccording to directions, and applied it with a rag and let that sit for 10 minutes on both the outdoor furniture and shower floor. It did a much better job of removing the dirt from both the lawn chairs and the shower.\n\nAnswer:",

Margarine contains unhealthy hydrogenated trans-fats, and it is extremely bad for you. It is not something I want to be putting into my body, and I am a bit surprised that Ms. Zukin would choose this as a butter substitute.There are other substitutes (such as unrefined coconut fat) that are much healthier. Unfortunately, I do not have the time or patience to experiment with replacing margarine with coconut fat in so many of her recipes.I have yet to find a dairy-free cookbook that provides a healthy butter substitute.\n\nAnswer:",

It was interesting and somewhat entertaining, but it was incredibly depressing and almost nihilistic. The people in the play sit in a bar all day and don't do anything. As a matter of fact, they don't even try to do anything. This play is similar to Arthur Miller's `Death of a Salesman' in the respect that both plays are sad and depressing, but Willy Loman in `Death of a Salesman' is a good, family man who is at least working hard and is at least trying to improve his life unlike the complete bums and pathetic losers in `The Iceman Cometh'.

BOUNTY by William Bligh\nText: This is William Bligh's personal account of the mutiny on board the H.M.S. Bounty in 1789. The first half of the account concerns the Bounty's travels among the islands, interactions with the indigenous peoples, and the transportation of breadfruit plants. These portions are quite often boring, as they get bogged down in mundane detail and nautical jargon. The account of the mutiny itself is extremely short. But the second half of the novel, Bligh's 3600 mile journey in an open boat, is gripping and astounding.Bligh's account, while more or less fair, is nevertheless one-sided. And dispute over what kind of man he was persist.

Though the album is a bit different from their earlier CDs, the new sound is still good. From the driving beats of the singles \"The Hand That Feeds\" and \"Only\" to the harder edgier sound of \"Getting Smaller\", this CD is all a NIN fan could have hoped for after their 6 year break. Some of the other, more industrial-like tracks, are reminiscent of the album The Downward Spiral, a favorite among many fans. Though some of the songs on the album are a bit dull and repetitive, the good certainly outweighs the bad. It's not their best album, but I think that With Teeth was a great effort at a new sound that pleases old fans and new ones as well.\n\nAnswer:",

What follows is a review from Billboard magazine. But I think it accurately reflects my feelings of \"When It Falls\":Many a critic and fan have been anxiously awaiting the release of this album, the follow-up to Zero 7's globally admired \"Simple Things.\" With the release of that album in 2001, Zero 7's Henry Binns and Sam Hardaker shared a wonderfully warm electronic soul vision with the world. Thankfully, the British duo did not feel the need to deviate from this winning sound on its sophomore set. Like its predecessor, \"When It Falls\" features the sublime vocal stylings of Sia Furler (news) (\"Somersault\"), Sophie Barker (\"Passing By\") and Mozez (\"Warm Sound\"). Danish newcomer Tina Dico makes her Zero 7 debut on two tracks: \"The Space Between\" and \"Home.\" The latter sounds like a long-lost recording from \"Ladies of the Canyon\"-era Joni Mitchell (news). Rich, lush and romantic, \"When It Falls\" is aural nourishment for the soul.\n\nAnswer:",

Overall, this book was okay but I had some problems with it. First of all, I thought the author's description of locations and places was completely lacking...I hardly felt as if I was there with Paul in the trenches or in the bombed out town, etc. because I felt I had not been given enough detail of the surroundings. Secondly, I thought the ending was pretty terrible. Not because of what happened (I expected as much) but because of the way it was written. I felt as if the ending was rushed and it left me, the reader, wondering what happened, exactly. However, I don't want to say more so I don't spoil it for those who haven't read it. I just want to say that while I think this is worthy of a read, it isn't \"the masterpiece\" that some people have made it out to be. I have read a lot of other books in the same genre that are much better written.\n\nAnswer:",

The characters, especially Elizabeth Bennet and Mr. Darcy are quite well drawn. One of the best aspects of the novel is the vantage point from which it is written.The reader learns everything through Elizabeth Bennet's point of view and sees the world through her prejudices. The point of view broadens as Elizabeth develops as a character and loses her prejudices, particularly against Mr. Darcy.Pride and Prejudice continues to be extremely popular and inspires many spin-offs including Pride and Prejudice and Zombies. Its influence on English literature and its continued appearance in popular culture alone make it worth reading.Trev @ trevsliteraryreview.blogspot.com\n\nAnswer:",

Real Monsters,\" \"KaBlam,\" and \"The Angry Beavers\" are not on Nicktoons Network anymore (I still like it however).And where's the Doug songs? I think Doug was stuck in repeats and they couldn't find anything. Also, where's the stuff from \"The Wild Thornberrys\" and \"Oh Yeah! Cartoons\"?Anyway I can't really listen to it because my copy's missing and I don't know where it is.However...HAPPY, HAPPY, JOY, JOY!\n\nAnswer:",

I used it with a recipe I found online for a healthier ice cream that I cooked on the stove before placing it in the ice cream maker to freeze. As far as I can tell, I followed the directions from the maker perfectly. The ice cream came nowhere close to ice cream consistency in the ice cream maker. I put it in the freezer, as the directions say you can do if you like firmer ice cream, and it came out an icy disgusting mess. I spent all day on the ice cream, so I was not happy. I couldn't even eat it. I called Cuisinart customer service and explained the situation. They said you HAVE to use the recipes in THEIR manual for it to come out correctly, which it didn't say anywhere in the directions or on the packaging. So they were no help. I then contacted Amazon who offered a 50% refund minus return shipping for the product. Blah. I am so mad. Don't waste your money on this awful awful product!!\n\nAnswer:",

I could have bought this size at a local store; I wouldn't have ordered it online had I only known it was not going to be the 3 inch rolling pen. Very frustrating when you go to all the trouble ordering & returning and then receiving another \"WRONG\" item! I would have rated it 4 stars if it had been as described in the ad.

I am enjoying the story a lot, and there seem to be a lot more dialogue options in this game than in NWN I.On the downside, you spend A LOT of time controlling the camera, especially on indoor dungeons. So many games have gotten camera control right, it's a shame this one didn't.The biggest plus over NWN I is that you can finally have a full party again. That's what made games like Baldur's Gate and Icewind Dale so much fun, and that fun is now back again. If your system meets the requirements for this game, you'll have a lot of fun.

It didn't really have time to develop the characters the way they should have been. The movie needed at least another 30 minutes. Other than that the movie was fine to me. Yeah, some of the guns were a little out there (like the gatling guns on the saddle and the dual cross bows that shot dynamite) but that is not enough to say the movie is horrible like some reviews I've read.

I used it on wet hair and the flat iron fully dried my hair using 3-4 passes over each section. I was even able to get the roots dry. My hair come out soft, smooth and STRAIGHT! Not poofy straight but straight! My hair is so soft and not frizzy at all. This is the best product I have ever tried. I have received so many compliments on my hair it's amazing.

They were very expensive and looked nice at first but soon the bronze plating begin to wear off around the aerator and the drain. The aerator is difficult to remove for cleaning and needs to be cleaned almost daily to keep water from spraying in all directions when the water is turned on. This week the faucet, not the plumbing under the sink, began to leak copiously. When trying to troubleshoot the problem on the telephone with the tech. rep. it was clear that although he bragged that he had been working at the job for 5 years, he didn't know anything about the construction of the faucet. He even insisted that the aerator and the piece that holds it into the faucet were 1 piece, even though it was clear that I was holding 2 pieces in my hand. He insisted that I didn't know what I was talking about. Would never buy another Danze faucet.\n\nAnswer:",

It did seem to help his dandruff/itchy scalp, but left him with oily hair too.

They are not played on the oldies channels which tend to focus on the group's 60's material, and you won't find it on the \"Classic Rock\" stations. This is unfortunate. Perhaps it has something to do with the relative lack of commercial success of most of these songs. This is sad, as I feel that this period was one of the most creative for the band. \"Add Some Music To Your Day\" is one of the group's best. I was always a fan of the Holland album and was happy to see that the \"The Trader\" and \"California Saga\" were included. The covers of \"Peggy Sue\", \"Come Go With Me\" and \"California Dreamin'\" are surprisely enjoyable. While this material is not as well known as their 60's classics, it has aged very well and stands the test of time. Recommended for all fans of the Beach Boys.\n\nAnswer:",

My only complaint about this watch is the size of the face. While I don't like the 'Mega face' trend watch makers are tending towards these days, this one is goes a little too far in the other direction. In fact when I opened the box I have to say I was a little shocked and thought I had ordered a women's watch by mistake.

It is more of a heavy overnight cream and I would be hesitant to put it on under my makeup during the day, but it is perfect for overnight.

Being in the construction business it's a real pain to be sending batteries back for rebuilding. If you're in the construction business you have to have at least double the 24 volt batteries you need because half are always out being rebuilt.

It seemed to be fine for about the first week. After that, the timer started working intermittently, so that every once in a while, but with increasing frequency, what ever was in the thing would simply burn to a crisp. More recently, it started toasting unevenly, so that half the bread or bagel would be quite dark and the other half would look like it had never been in a toaster. I went out and bought a 4 slice Cuisinart toaster, which is what I should have done to begin with. It is considerably more money, but at least it works.\n\nAnswer:",

I only bought it because of Clay, so I wasn't really planning on liking much of the rest of the CD. However, it's pretty good. Clay, of course, get's all of the stars I could possibly give him. His version of \"The First Noel\" is beautiful, and he also sings on \"Silver Bells\", \"Oh Come All Ye Faithful\", and \"Santa Claus Is Coming To Town\", so I definitely think Clay fans should buy this. I also thought Kelly sounded really good on \"Oh Holy Night\" and \"My Grown Up Christmas List,\" but as usual, I was a little bit disappointed that she gave it her touch of soul. I think Christmas songs sound better as pop, but maybe that's just me. I also really enjoyed Kim Locke. The rest of the idols were good, but not really my cup of tea. I like more than 75% of this album, and it really put me in the Christmas mood, so I would recommend it!\n\nAnswer:",

It does not stay closed. When I pull it out of the back of my suv it pops open jabbing me in the legs. The basket is nice and deep but wont stay in the up position. It constantly falls down and it must be up to close the stroller. Today I went to the park and when leaving I tried to close it and the button you have to push to close it is stuck. The stroller will not even fold up!!! I spent 15 minutes in the parking lot trying to get the button to work so I could close it while sweating in the 90 degree heat and my poor 10 month old crying in the car. I eventually had to pick the entire thing up and throw it in my trunk in the open position. Thankfully I have a truck. On a good note, the stroller is nice and roomy, good for baby to lounge and the basket is deep if it does stay open. I would NOT RECOMMEND THIS STROLLER! Dont waste your money!!!!\n\nAnswer:",

I then struggled for a couple of hours trying to get it to see my computer. After resetting the unit a couple of times, downloading the latest firmware and re-installing the server software on my PC, I resorted to a Google search and came across some references to Microsoft Windows Media Connect, which also mentioned the DSM-320. I downloaded version 2.0 from the Microsoft website, upon which my PC detected the DSM-320 and asked which folders I wanted to make available. Seconds later, I was streaming content to my stereo downstairs without any problems whatsoever.My advice? If you're running Windows XP with Service Pack 2, don't waste your time with the D-Link software supplied in the box but go straight for Microsoft Windows Media Connect.

When the Beard released their new cd, I was let down. It was obvious that Neal's presence was missed. Now that Testimony is here, I remember what I love so much about Neal's music. Neal has a way of taking you on a musical journey. With Testimony we get awesome musicianship along with moving lyrics. Testimony leans more towards a Transatlantic sound rather than Spock's Beard, but it is different also. The album is heavy in orchestration. It is very powerful. The lyrical content is really good. Neal is telling his personal story and tetimony of how he came to know Jesus. Some have said that it is churchy, but since this is the things that he has experienced in his journey, he must express them how he saw and felt them, be it churchy or not. I am very impressed and excited. If you are a Neal Morse fan, you will not be let down. If you are looking for great music with a great message, then check this out!\n\nAnswer:",

I never heard any other of their previous albums and after listening to this one, I don't really have the desire to do so. It is true that Sum 41 copied a lot of other bands on Chuck but that doesn't really matter to me. If a band plays good and makes good music I don't really care how or from who they got their ideas. I didn't really like the album mostly becuase I don't like their style of music. Almost all the tracks sound the same, you can't tell one from another. Also, most of the tracks have beats that are too fast for my liking. I only enjoyed 4 tracks on the album: 5, 8, 11, 12. Personally I like Yellowcard's Ocean Avenue much better.\n\nAnswer:",

It fits well in my hand and even when it is full I can loop my finger through the top and carry it for long distances without it hurting me. It keeps my water cold for a long period of time and I really like the dust cap; however, I didn't realize that the bottle would \"breathe\" when I drank from it. It makes this high pitched squeaky noise like a seal barking really fast. This isn't a problem in a workout class or when I am out running on my own but when I am sitting in class or a meeting it is embarrassing to drink from. This is honestly enough of a deal breaker for me that I would send it back if I could but since I don't want to pay the $6 return shipping fee that Amazon charges...

It stopped working almost 2 years to the day i bought it. I've had this experience a few times with Apple products.

I used it primarily to hook up to my car stereo, which plugs into the headphone jack. Plugging and unplugging it a few times everyday did wear out the headphone jack after a little more than a year, and it needed to be replaced, but I wasn't too upset about that. I worried about leaving it in my car so I would disconnect it every time I had to stop somewhere, so it did get more wear than it would from someone who left headphones plugged in all the time.\n\nAnswer:",

Elsewhere, it says to \"bring to a simmer and simmer\" when it means bring to a boil and simmer. We tried 3 recipes, all of which bombed--2 of them were too spicy to eat, and I love spicy food. This is a horrible cookbook. I can't figure out why Donna Hay is such a popular cookbook author.

The two boys end up on the run.Intense, desperate and meandering, the plot comes together in an ending that is open to highly metaphorical interpretation.Terrence Malick was a producer and there are elements of his films (\"Days of Heaven,\" \"Badlands,\" \"The Thin red Line\") in both style and content.

Although the songs are sung fairly well, they seem to lack the usual sparkle, blending, and ease of delivery that one comes to expect from this group. Also, with all the great songs that Frank Loesser wrote I find the CD program to be a rather poor representation of Frank's artistry....\"Where's Charley\" and \"Hans Christian Andersen\" medleys? Why wasn't music from \"The Most Happy Fella\" included? I found that the \"Guys and Dolls\" medley and a few other tracks made the purchase worthwhile.

Unfortunately, I do not live near a retail store that sells Molton Brown products so I did not have the opportunity to smell the sample before purchasing it. I bought Naran Ji Fine solely based on the overwhelming high reviews from various websites and for it being their number one seller. Having said all of this, the scent does last a long time and if you like a strong floral scent, you may like it, but it was not the right scent for me.\n\nAnswer:",

The one thing I didn't like, which for me is a deal-breaker, is that the seat cushion does not have any support under it. You basically hammer in the seat cushion to the chair with tiny nails and then that's it. There is no support underneath besides the frame of the chair. I am afraid that one of these days we are going to sink through! The bottom of the seat is very flimsy, too, so you can't really trust it; it's super light with what feels like cardboard with some padding on top of it. If I knew it was going to be like this, i would have returned it, but we already assembled it so it is too much of a pain to return, plus shipping and handling was like $23, so we would have spent $46 for nothing to send it back.\n\nAnswer:",

I am also a fan of Tom Skerritt who stars in this one as Will Kane, the hapless marshal whose integrity and honor force him to make a solitary stand against four bad guys and an apathetic town.I am sorry to say that, despite a valiant effort by Skerritt, this remake and the rest of the cast fall woefully short. Even at bargain price I would pass on this one if I were you. It's just an impossible task to do what is attempted here: remaking or improving on perfection. Gary Cooper defined the role of Will Kane. Period. You might as well attempt a remake of THE COWBOYS, TRUE GRIT, THE SHOOTIST or THE SEARCHERS with someone other than John Wayne in the lead.THE HORSEMAN\n\nAnswer:",

A must-read book\nText: For anyone even mildly interested in Bigfoot -- whether believer, skeptic, or on the fence -- Rife's book provides an intriguing and thoroughly engrossing look at accounts of Bigfoot encounters. It's fascinating to see how people react differently to the incidents -- some immediately run away, others are frozen, and a few actually run toward the creatures!I never realized how widespread Bigfoot encounters are. Rife provides accounts from 48 states (only Rhode Island and Hawaii have no tales) and recounts them through well-written narrative as well as direct quotes from the witnesses. Whatever your opinion about Bigfoot, these accounts will surely leave you with a tingle down your spine.\n\nAnswer:",

However, I just found out that the plastic bottles that they come in are #7 which is contaminated with a chemical called Bisphenol A or more commonly known as BPA. Do a google on this chemical. Most baby companies that make bottles like Avent and Dr Brown's have recently begun using plastics that do not have BPA because of the dangers associated with it especially in young children. Shame on Pediasure for not taking the initiative to protect our children. I am going to start making smoothies for my daughter instead.\n\nAnswer:",

This time out Granny Weatherwax, Nanny Ogg and the other witches of their coven must protect their homeland of Lancre from an incursion by a clan of vampires who have been training themselves to be immune to such things as garlic and religious icons (it's all psychosomatic, you see). Pratchett, as always, is brilliantly funny and biting with his satire. No target is safe. As the title of the book implies, Pratchett's motto seems to be \"carpe jugulum... go for the throat.\"I must admit, as far as the series-within-a-series Discworld books go, it took time for me to warm up to Granny Weatherwax. She and her coven have become some of my favorites among Pratchett's creations, though, and this book was perhaps their best outing yet.\n\nAnswer:",

I was stuck in it, and if you are anything like me and have to pee anywhere from 5-9 times in the middle of the night, you may need diapers. I would have had to wake up my husband to help me out of the pillow in order to get up. The thickness at the head is extreme, and if you are already having back pain it only makes it worse. I tried flipping it upside down and putting my own pillow in the space, but that didn't work either b/c the thick part was between my thighs, making it too uncomfortable. I didn't even sleep with it one night, and I am in the process of returning it now. The quality is impeccable, but the design needs to be altered.\n\nAnswer:",

Petty's previous slingshots at the music industry (a line in the title song from INTO THE GREAT WIDE OPEN, for instance) seemed to convey a sense of defiant independence, but here, Petty just seems to sound cynical and nasty, without any idea of a remedy for the problem of music-biz greed and corruption. The previous inspirational lyrics (\"Refugee\" and \"Even The Losers\" from DAMN THE TORPEDOES and \"I Won't Back Down\" from FULL MOON FEVER are wondrous examples) have, sadly, been replaced by mean-spirited hopelessness that cannot be mitigated by his advocacy of sanctions against Indonesia in the wake of that country's trumped-up drug-smuggling conviction against a young Australian tourist. It turns out that Petty is releasing a new album at the end of this year or the beginning of next, so let's hope it's less cynical and more hopeful than this one.\n\nAnswer:",

Thomas pulls us into her life and her mind as we venture through all the changes with her. The book is written so conversationally that the reader can't help but feel as if the author is a close friend and one we care strongly about. While there are struggles and sadness in the book, the tone doesn't become heavy or depressing. Thomas manages to keep it upbeat so that we're not bogged down by the events. As she learns to live again, we are right there with her and learn much about our own thoughts and feelings. What would we do if our lives were twisted in a way such as her's was? Would we come through it as strongly as she? These are questions that flicker through the mind and it gives one pause to wonder. This is an all around great book and a quick read.

At the time, neither video made an impression on me...Well, fourteen years later, I came across SD's self-titled CD at the library and decided to borrow it. All I can say is that rockabilly and punk never sounded so good together! The CD is so good I went out and bought a copy of my own! In addition to that, Mike Ness' tales of hard luck and the downtrodden make it even all the more appealing. I especially like their cover of Johnny Cash's \"Ring Of Fire\". Pretty darn good if you think about it. :)In any case, this is a CD that I'll be playing for years to come!\n\nAnswer:",

They would then market the end result as a 'live' (in quotes) recording, thus having the effect of a live recording, without the costs of putting on a concert. I suspect that this record is one such album. That aside, it has some brilliant songs, recalling the Soul Stirrers' golden era with Sam Cooke and R.H. Harris. I first had this on cassette tape in the 70's (which fell apart many years ago) and I search far and wide for it ever since. Now that I found it, nearly 30 years later, it sounds every bit as good as I remembered. This is a worthy CD for any Soul Stirrers fan's collection.\n\nAnswer:",

In Ms. Rendell's novel, the title appears to be referring to John Cosway, an autistic man who lives with his mother and four sisters in a run-down, ramshackle estate. As the story develops, however, it seems that this is an entire family of monsters, with the son being,in actuality, the most human of them all. The mother and four sisters are almost completely selfish and self-motivated, often at the expense of their children or siblings, although one sister is perhaps a little better than the rest. This is not my favorite work by Ruth Rendell writing as Barbara Vine but I think it is one of the most memorable. Whether writing as Ms. Rendell or Ms. Vine, Ms. Rendell is such an expert at developing character, motivations, and interesting situations, that her books under either name are highly enjoyable and a true pleasure to read.\n\nAnswer:",

I am a freshmen in high school and my whole Literature Pre-AP class had to read Fahrenheit 451 for an assignment. Now I know what you're probably thinking, well of course it's going to be confusing for a freshmen. But, I beg to differ. This book is written good I suppose, but the story jumps around too much and certain parts come up and it is just plain confusing (i.e. Dentham's Dentifrice). Well that is about all I have to say about this novel. I'm sure if I read it over again I would enjoy it more. But I don't think this book would be much more than 2 or 3 stars.\n\nAnswer:",

It's a bad game and the developer is hoping it will sell because of its sex appeal and intense amounts of gore. Don't be fooled, this game is going to be a mediocre (at best) action game. The game is basically a rip off Max Payne, Devil May Cry 2, and Blood Omen: Legacy of Kain with a lot more gore, sex appeal, and the gameplay doesn't nearly match up to the games it is \"ripping off\" from. The gameplay is supposivly very similar to Resident Evil. Although I love Resident Evil, this game is a fast paced action game and RE's controls are better suited for survival-horror..not action.Remember..there are lots of games out there with a lot of sex/gore appeal but that doesn't make them all good. Some such as Grand Theft Auto: Vice City, BMX XXX, Resident Evil, or Mortal Kombat:Deadly Alliance (trust me, it will sincerely be a good game) will be good but others such as BloodRayne are just trash.\n\nAnswer:",

The digital readout is a major plus, especially considering that most thermostats in this price range are analogue. I secured the probe directly to the heating strip and set the temperature to 95F and the temperatures have remained steady around 92F - 95F. The thermostat also gives you the current temperature, which is also very convenient.I've also own two 1000 watt Zilla thermostats, and I prefer the Hydrofarm over the Zilla for two reasons: (1) Hydorfarm's is digital, which makes setting an exact temperature possible, and (2) it displays the current temperature. The probe is also about 10x smaller than Zilla's.I would recommend this product both for its price and the quality.\n\nAnswer:",

It was touted as one of the worst movies of the year. I would not say that. I'd say if you are a fan of romantic comedies and glimpses into the lives of how different marriages and people operate, give this a shot. It is no where near perfect, and is definitely one director's vision into a movie like this. The acting isn't great either, and sometimes Mandy can get to be too much. BUT if you can rent it for cheap or catch it on one of the movie channels (Showtime is running it already), go ahead and take a chance and watch it if it's up your alley. It's only 1 1/2 hours, so hey, if you don't like it then you only lost 1 1/2 hours of your time. I just don't like movies that are actually watchable to get such a bad rap.Take a chance on this one; hey, you may actually love it!\n\nAnswer:",

This is because all of the characters have been upgraded and they all have new moves.As for the graphics. We all know that the ps2 is a graphics machine. And TTT is no exception. As far as I'm concerned, TTT on the ps2 looks better than any game in the arcade, PC, or dreamcast to date.If you want a game that won't collect dust on your entertainment center after 10 hours of gameplay, then I highly recommend you look into this game.

It really helps that all songs are on one or two facing pages, so no page-turning is involved.These charts are very accurate, contrary to another comment below. I'm on my second copy of this book in seven years (it does tend to fall apart after a while) and have been very happy with the accuracy of the chords, unlike some other books I've seen.If you want to play note-for-note riffs and leads, then get the The Complete Scores, but if you just want to play and sing the songs, this book can't be beat!\n\nAnswer:",

The publisher did not clean up the spelling mistakes, and wrote everything IN UPPER CASE, which is annoying to read.

I'm all for believing in fairies, and I don't discount them offhandedly, but if you want to see pictures, this isn't the way to go. I would want the author to come up with pictures that have more pixels, that are clear, that are printed on good paper.

It's not bad, just not as consistent as others they have put out. The music on here is a mixed bag of \"soul\" spanning the 70s, 80s, and 90s. It starts off with a really nice version of Stevie Wonder's \"Golden Lady\" by Jose Feliciano, but then come the jarring presence of Driza Bone and later Lisa Stansfield and even Me'Shell Ndegeocello. Again, none of this is awful, but it just doesn't flow or fit the mood of the rest of the album. Tracks by Beats International, Omar, and the Blow Monkeys are better, but not really prime soul classics either. An interesting idea for a compilation, but not one that works that well.\n\nAnswer:",

Luckily with the extended warranty my son will be able to get a replacement game system, but it won't be an Xbox 360.\n\nAnswer:",

However, being an avid reader I could see immediately how this could be the best purchase I've made in a long time. It didn't disappoint me in the least. I love to re-read books, so I'm in the habit of keeping all the books I've ever purchased. You can imagine what my bookshelves look like. The appeal of having all your books on one device (much like an ipod) was seductive at the very least. I absolutely love the built-in dictionary. The device itself it well designed and easy to use. I'm amazed at how many things it can do besides reading a book. Of course it's primarily a reader, but what a great toy as well! I consider the money very well spent and highly recommend this to others.\n\nAnswer:",

I've had mine over a year in a house with three cats. It does get clogged occasionally, especially the brush attachment and the tube. But a little routine cleaning takes care of things and gets it back to normal.As for the filters, please do not listen to the lazy people who can't do a little legwork and find replacements. A well maintained filter (washed in water every 3-4 months) should last over a year. While Amazon doesn't seem to carry replacements, they are available at Bed Bath & Beyond's website and I've been lucky to find them in the store near me. Buy two and you should be okay for the lifetime of this vacuum. Also, someone here said that sharkvac.com isn't a valid website, but they're wrong - you can also buy replacement filters through that site as well.In all, this seems to be a dependable vacuum that is reasonably priced.\n\nAnswer:",

She is very well painted, and is a visually stunning piece. My only complaint with this, and the reason i only gave it four stars instead of five, is that her feet don't fit well into the slots on the base. Both of her feet have slots on the base they are supposed to fit into, however, they are not spaced right. I was not able to get both feet in both slots, so i have one foot in, and the other is just balancing. However, she does stand up well and this minor problem is not a big enough reason to me to pass up this exquisite figure.\n\nAnswer:",

I ordered Super Baby Food and Blender Baby Food at the same time, and was able to get started with baby food after reading the first few pages of this one. It's that easy to get into. Yes, order one of the bigger books if you want lots and lots of info, but if you just want a quick manual on how-to, this is a good book to get. The recipes are very very easy.My favorite recipes in here are the brown rice cereal (I make it all the time for my daughter) and the pear-applesauce, which is SO awesome, I steal my daughter's all the time out of the freezer when I need a sweet treat and finish off hers after she's done eating if she doesn't want any more!The only downside to this book is that some of the ingredients are a little weird, like sea vegetables, but if you're into health food, you'll love it.\n\nAnswer:",

I've been down with him ever since I heard him on \"The Chronic\" and \"Doggystyle\".The West coast-disc was the best of the two CD's on \"Kuruption!\". Kurupt sounds like he should do on it. The East coast-disc is not that good, a couple of songs, but not all of them.If you're into Kurupt, you gotta have this album. He deserves 5 stars for his lyrical skills alone.

I grilled them inside on this cast iron grill and they turned out better than on the grill. I did use olive oil to prevent sticking and medium heat. The reason for three stars is clean up. The marinade that dripped out of the chicken hardened within the grooves during cooking. It was so hard to clean. I tried heating water in the pan, putting in oven with water and ended up scraping out with a butter knife. It worked but took about 15 minutes. Hamburgers were much easier. I am still a huge fan of cast iron. They are the only pans I use. My all time favorite is Lodge Logic circle griddle.Lodge Logic L9OG3 Pre-Seasoned 10-1/2-Inch Round Griddle\n\nAnswer:",

Most of the other actors are pretty good, Robert Shaw and Edward Fox especially, and Barbara Bach looks luscious (and as a bonus, she gets about as naked as you can get in a PG-rated movie).In short, this movie is clearly inferior to the original \"Navarone\" as well as other MacLean-inspired movies like \"Where Eagles Dare\" and \"Ice Station Zebra.\" Inferior doesn't mean bad, but it's still the worst movie that I've ever seen more than 5 times.\n\nAnswer:",

However, I grabbed these bags because I pump at work and being able to pump directly into bags would save the time. I was horribly wrong. Cleaning up spilled milk takes longer than transferring to bags from bottles. These are really awkward to use if you only have two hands (which I'm pretty sure most, if not all nursing moms do). The seals are really finicky and I'm always scared the bags are going to bust open in my pump bag on the way home from work. I've also had issues with the holes for the attachment \"hooks\" ripping. Add in the limited space for milk (5 oz as opposed to Lansinoh's 6oz bags with room to spare) and the milk that gets above the zipper seal while you're pumping (even with a Pump In Style), and these are just a bad product. I bought two boxes of Lansinoh bags today and I'll never try to switch brands again!\n\nAnswer:",

This workout did not disappoint either. You have to pay attention to the cueing, and it's not meant for beginners. But I tackled this one without viewing it first, and I kept up with them. I missed a few steps here or there, but that's to be expected for a first time. If you can follow Kari Anderson or Petra Kolbert, you can do this. If I was new to stepping, this one probably would have made me cry, but I started stepping back in the days of Jane Fonda, so I know my way around a step bench. I got a great work-out. My only complaints are 1.) the DVD doesn't tell you how long the warm-up, workout, and cool-down are on the jacket or on the DVD menu, and 2.) the stretches seemed rushed to me. I usually end up stretching more on my own when the DVD is over. Aside from that...I love this DVD.\n\nAnswer:",

The soap has a great refreshing scent and gives an invigorating cooling effect because of the menthol. It is easy to lather, and provides good protection and moisturizes well. The brush whips up a great lather, but when using on the face it is a little stiff. After use, it does seem to have softened up some. Overall, I am very satisfied with these items!\n\nAnswer:",

When we got the Sunday paper, I would scan through the obits, read the ages of the deceased and their life achievements. The thought of encapsulating someone's life in 4 to 5 inches of column space seemed like a huge task. Marilyn Johnson's book focuses on the people who do just that, those that write obituaries. She interviews obit writers in both the US and England, selecting ones whose obituaries she has enjoyed reading. It also talks about the different type of obituaries and how the format has changed through time. This is one of those books where I said to myself \"wow, you really CAN write a book on just about any topic\".\n\nAnswer:",

He was reading it on a family vacation and he LOVED it so much he read it cover to cover in 2 days. The funny thing was that, probably because of his age, he completely didn't get the fact that the book was a parody on zombies. He took all of it very seriously and he would come in and fill us all on little known zombie facts. I thought I was going to die laughing.My 30-something brother picked it up and just had a great time with it. He said it was a fun and interesting read. We capped off the trip with a Zombie movie marathon that the boys analyzed for us with their new knowledge of Zombies.Bottom line: both loved it and gave it 5 stars.\n\nAnswer:",

She had a light voice of limited range (I'd say about one octave) which she used sweetly with a \"cool\" delivery unusual for her time. She recorded standards as well as remakes of old British and Scotch folks songs like \"It Was a Lover and His Lass.\"But honestly, she was nothing special. There were so many other pop-jazz singers of that time who could sing rings around her, Connee Boswell, Ella, Billie, Helen Ward, Mildred Bailey, even June Richmond. Check them out if you don't believe me.This is OK singing. I have four of her records on a John Kirby compilation and I like them primarily for her cool style which was unusual for its time, but I'd think twice before buying a whole CD by her.\n\nAnswer:",

The ice cream came out wonderfully! I did find that I had to run the machine for 5 min longer to get the proper consistency.I knocked off one star since the plastic lid is permanently attached to the motor housing of the paddle, so you can't immerse it to clean and cleaning thoroughly is a bit difficult. Other than that, so far I have no other problems with this machine.For the reviewer who was disappointed about not being able to make gelato, I can't really see why you couldn't as \"gelato\" is really only ice milk in reality...experiment and you might be surprised! In fact, here is a link to a site that gives ice cream and gelato recipes. As a matter of fact the ice cream maker they picture *is* a Lello!http://www.ice-cream-recipes.com/\n\nAnswer:",

As soon as I plugged it in, and turned on the game, the person I was trying to control starting moving backwards at a pretty fast clip.

Sony sucks. They have lost all interest in quality control. They are going on their name alone. I have 2 sons who have exactly the same problem with thier Sony controllers. I was going to send it back, but I just figured it would be a hassle, so I threw it away. Forget Sony if you want anything with high quality.

The movie starts off where the first one left off: Spiderman is at the peak of his superhero status, and as with any peak, there is a fall in store. Spiderman gets fired; he is delayed in paying rent; and he's not doing that well in school; his love, MJ, thinks he's a flake. Well, he has a job to do. The choice is his -- continue to be Spiderman, or live the life of a regular guy? Initially, he chooses the regular guy status, but falls short. He later learns that his role is to be a superhero, which means sacrificing certain things that others take for granted, such as falling in love and marrying the girl of one's choice.\n\nAnswer:",

You get a decent workout -- but as many other people have said, the cueing is BAD. Plus several of the moves are just plain NOT safe. I'm a certified personal trainer and have done aerobics for years, so I'm pretty experienced at saying this -- the lunges with a twist is just not good for your knees. Plus some of the moves with weights could definitely hurt you if you are using a heavy weight. I normally work out using 10 - 20 pound weights and could only use 5 pound weights for most of the video because of the speed and number of reps. Not sure why she kept saying to use \"medium to heavy weights\". Overall just very disappointed that The Firm would put out such a poorly put together video.\n\nAnswer:",

It's a love story, but it's innocent and bittersweet, which gives it it's charm. The movie is one to which everyone can relate to. Rosemary and Gabe are like our inner child, and New York City as the setting is beautiful, it gives off the \"magical place where anything can happen\" aura.The cast is also incredible.Everything fits and comes together almost perfectly. I especially liked the fact that they made Gabe the narrator and that he doesn't come off as corny, but more as a cynic as far as love and girls go (which would be understandable for his age). The movie never loses pace and I didn't once look at my watch, which is a huge plus.Overall, it's a movie I really enjoyed watching and that I'd highly recommend.\n\nAnswer:",

They have learned exactly how to use it and actually do a great job with it -- so it is educational. It is also very durable and has survived a few falls. However, the picture quality is SO bad that the pictures are completely useless! They come out grainy, yellowed, and either too dark or over exposed.

I remember having something like it when i was little but i don't remember it being so difficult to maneuver. only one button is easy to push. the other 4 are more complicated and my toddler has a hard time popping the toys out. usually i make the animals pop out and he pushes them back in which is much easier to do. I also find the toy very loud and unsettling. each time an animal pops out there is this big bang. I dont like noisy toys and this kind of gets on my nerves. my son doesnt seem to like it too much either. I think if it wasn't so startling each time it pops he would enjoy it much more.the concept is great and it is durable and has educational value (teaches hand coordination) which is why i still gave it 3 stars.\n\nAnswer:",

Bring Your GPS Device Or You'll Get Lost In the Details\nText: The writing in this novel is exquisite. However, any reader who isn't familiar with Orthodox Judaism will need a road map, a cultural dictionary and a Yiddish-speaking tour guide if they want to understand the book. The time line is also confusing as the story jumps back and forth between the present and the past.Author Naomi Ragen writes beautifully about the culture of religious Judaism, but she never lets the reader in on the secret, never decodes the lingo so that they can walk in Tamar's shoes, which is necessary if the reader is going to be able to empathize with the character. For this reason, the book is less than satisfying and I would hesitate to recommend it.\n\nAnswer:",

While it is true that the album sounds horrible, the songs are good. Frantic and St. Anger are both great songs, and so is \"The unnamed feeling\", just to name a few. The drums are very loud, but don't sound as bad as some people say. It's really the guitar-sounds that really(...). The guitars sound way too muddy, so at times it's hard to hear what is actually being played. This album is not the melodic Metallica of the Black album and (Re)Load, and it is also not the pre 1991 Metallica. This album is something completely new. I just wish the album sounded better. If you can get over the sound of this record you'll be able to appreciate this effort. Just don't expect any ballads.\n\nAnswer:",

The book not only contains beautiful illustrations, but it also provides a well-written and clear account of the history behind the development of this art and the manner in which indigineous and mestizo painters achieved the syncretism of two different religious beliefs and traditions, by imbibing the European art forms with their own symbolism. Anyone interested in learning about this type of art would do well to start with this book. The author writes in a way that is easy to understand, even for non art-historians, and provides a wonderful and revealing explanation of the cultural significance of these paintings.\n\nAnswer:",

I don't think it shaves quite as close as a blade in the tough areas, but it's not significant. The auto clean is a nice feature as well.

I liked the fact that it used flash memory with no moving parts to break. It is also expandable with an SD card, but I never tried it. I paid $135 from Amazon at the time.She used it happily for four months. It only \"crashed\" once with a weird memory error that wasn't obvious to reformat, but I figured it out somehow.Last night she told me it was broken; the VOLUME DOWN button wouldn't work. UP worked fine, but she couldn't turn the volume DOWN. I knew the unit was out of the 90-day warranty so I opened it. I found the volume-down switch separating from the circuit board. Rio wants $99 to replace it, so I'm going to try my best to fix it. Either way, I'll never buy another Rio product.I gave the unit one star since the cost of ownership in my experience is about $30/month.\n\nAnswer:",

I guess what I really love about Ani is her ability to take a simple melody, add a bunch of different instrumentals, creative lyrics, her emotional voice, some really unique chords and key changes and turn it into something complex, but not grating. I felt like only 2 songs on this album did that: Studying Stones and Paradigm. The rest of the tracks, I just didn't enjoy listening to because I didn't like the melodies. I don't have all of her albums (I have 8, I think) but this is the first one where I don't absolutely love at least 2/3 of the songs.

It does clean baby, and his hair smells nice. I have since learned that organic liquid castille soap (like Dr. Bronner's baby castille soap) is fine for hair and body. I put some in a liquid soap 'foaming' bottle with some jojoba oil for conditioning & I use that for shampoo. You can google recipes for homemade shampoo using castille soap. You can also use melted coconut butter or flax oil to condition your hair (sounds silly, but it works great!) Be sure to use only a little bit of coconut butter before washing your hair (yes, condition before washing, not after) and use only a small amount - it goes a long way.\n\nAnswer:",

It was not true to Alexandra Ripley's book, which in turn was not true to the original GWTW. The whole murder and trial plot line was bizarre. Why did Belle Watling appear in Charleston? Rhett with blue eyes, Scarlett with brown eyes? Whoever wrote the screenplay was not familiar enough with the original material to realize what details were just not meant to be messed with. Okay as a television drama, but it doesn't live up to its association with GWTW.

The pace keeps moving swiftly, and the action is compelling. The acting is impressive, especially that of Edward Atterton. Atterton plays a German spy on the ship. His mission is to either take control of the vessel or sink it. With a skillful performance, he causes the viewer to really believe that he will accomplish his mission at all costs. But in the end, he is only doing his duty. As for the movie's other qualities, the computer graphics appear cartoonish at first, but they end up adding creative and helpful scenes to the storyline. For example, the aerial shot of the German submarine's torpedoes heading towards the Britannic is quite stunning. All in all, an entertaining story speculating on the demise of the Britannic.

I hope that I'm wrong, and that they bounce back, but 100th Window is a big letdown. Not terrible, but certainly not up to their usual standards. 100th Window may appeal to some (it reminds me vaguely of Radiohead, whom I also find dull but others like). It's definitely different from earlier MA albums, and the first monotonous, boring album they've done. I'm all for change, but not just plain giving up.\n\nAnswer:",

David Lynch still has the knack for catching the weirdness of life on film, it's just that in the Straight Story, he does it in a non-shocking way. The cinematography is wonderful, as you would expect with a Lynch film and the acting is particularly strong. These actors are not beautiful Hollywood stars, but average looking people with lots of talent. The story, as Lynch tells it is heartwarming without being hokey at all, it's funny, yet remains true to the story. Richard Farnsworth is a masterful actor who with one single silent expression can convey a wealth of emotion.See this movie now, you won't regret it. Highly recommended.\n\nAnswer:",

The movie is not encouraging, though it does hold your interest.The filmmakers focus on the reasons it so difficult to lose weight. We evolved in a world of scarcity and our ability to gain weight (and then keep our weight up) helped us when food was not available. The scarcity is gone (at least in the developed world). As a result, we find its easy to gain weight and difficult to lose it.The people who appear in the film are likeable, and one sympathizes with their earnest attempts to \"do the right thing.\" But the viewer sees little reason to hope that their lives will improve. The filmmakers imply that it is just too difficult to control weight in our calorie-rich, sedentary world. (Fat does present gastric bypass surgery as an effective way to lose weight).Fat is not a bad film, but another documentary on the same issue - Killer at Large - does a better job of engaging its viewers.\n\nAnswer:",

The grammer, punctuation and sentence structure is so poor in places that it is hard to follow the story as you would a regular book. Clearly this book is either self-published or published by a very small publishing company. No major publisher would print a book with such blatant errors. When the author is trying to make a point, the typestyle, which is much larger than necessary to begin with, often changes to all capitals. Sentences are ended with several exclamation points, I assume for effect. In reality this just comes across as BEING SHOUTED AT BY THE AUTHOR! (See what I mean?)

I really think the haters need to get over their preconceptions on this movie, sure it's going to have cliches and jumps scares, but theres so much to like. The vampires are way more in line with my personal preferences on how they would behave; rather than trying to sexually seduce or hypnotize a victim, they just tear them apart. They're vicious beasts, and it's a fantastic portrayal. There's good (not great) lines of dialogue, good action and gore, and it doesn't pull punches. There are problems, sure, but just sit back and enjoy the ride. This isn't a Palme D'or winner about raising a child in a war torn African village...it's a horror movie about vampires.

This is a great introduction for kids travelling anywhere and especially for kids who will be travelling to New York City. The music is beautifully written and catchy enough that I find myself singing along every time. Newt the newt is a fun character and the kids in the video are sweet. I love this video, but my son loves it even more. He often asks for \"Newt, Newt\"!I have to say that the person who reviewed this video previously has gotten really mixed up and must have ordered the wrong video. It's also really out of date and should be removed. I give this video 5 stars for being parent and kid friendly and having the best music of any kids video I've ever seen!\n\nAnswer:",

This book has much more about \"the hunt\" than it does about \"the engineer.\" Even more broadly, this book is about the Israel politics in the 1990s, the attempts at peace, attempts by terrorist groups to thwart that peace and Israel's attempts to stop those terrorists. At times, Ayyash (the engineer) seems like a bit player in this narrative. There is very little biographical information available about Ayyash, so Katz makes do with what he has.I agree with another review who was concerned with Katz's overly vivid descriptions of events and scenes he didn't witness. I also found some of the bombing scene descriptions redundant and cliched.As a whole, however, this book is a good choice for those interested in modern Israeli affairs, terrorism and counter-terrorism and peace between Israel and the Palestinians.\n\nAnswer:",

When I put the Dyson on the \"carpet\" setting and vacuumed these certain areas, it made a horrible screaching sound that scared my son.

First of all, it was kind of odd how Heather and her father just went to an auction without a horse trailer, halter, or leadrope. I wasn't crazy about the illustrations, either. The ponies all looked like a cross between a Beanie Baby and a dragon. Apple, Heather's pony, actually had facial expressions! When two girls insulted Apple he frowned, and when Heather was patting or riding him, he smiled. It was cute, but sort of weird.Not counting the inacuracy of the horse facts and illustrations, it was a very cute book. Girls between six and ten would love it. Of course, for a little girl who is truly horse crazy and knows a lot about ponies already, I would reccomend a series like Bonnie Bryant's Pony Tails. They are full of accurate horse facts.\n\nAnswer:",

I have been playing guitar for over 35 years, and have owned a lot of different amps in my day. And one amp just isnt enough anymore. I do a lot of recording and experamenting with sound, and this amp has plenty. This amp has (3) different amp models and a boat load of great sounding effects. This amp has a decent amount of power, and could be used in small to mid sized venues, it will get over the drums no problem. Amp also has MIDI and (3) different gain and speaker simulations. So if your looking for a combo amp with tons of versatility, and a fair amount of power, you will not find more bang for your buck than this little gem. This is my second behringer amp, and I have a lot of other behringer products. They have all held up well and done right by me. Behringer sometimes gets a bad rap because they are inexpensive, but those peaple are just haters. So buy with confadence, and God Bless!\n\nAnswer:",

So I usually have a few glasses of scotch when I cook, no big deal. So to prevent any accidents, its important for a knife to have excellent balance and feel, and not be too sharp. I'm not a circus performer or a knife juggler, so I don't have the kind of dexterity needed to handle an extremely sharp knife after I've had a few.Of the five times I have used this knife, I cut myself four of those times. If I shell out the money for a supposedly high-quality knife, I expect it to be effective, but forgiving.Another gripe of mine is that I have found the knife to be completely ineffective for certain uses, such as cleaning and skinning wild game. Again, if I'm going to pay premium prices, I expect the product to be versatile.\n\nAnswer:",

The songs have great breakbeats, but they're not as interesting any of the above British guys.

I didn't need to but it was cheap so I did.Pros:-Setup was very simple; much easier than the Linksys router. The CD walks any user through the process, regardless of that individual's IT expierience.-The signal is very strong; I can connect to this router with full strength from anywhere within my apartment (approximatley 800 sq. feet).Cons:-Singal constantly drops or locks up. I am often surfing and my laptop will disconnect; when I try to reconnect I am unable to do so. The router has to be restarted and for those of you who have done it you know it is a time-consuming process. The router, cable modem, and both computers have to be restarting. Takes all of 10 minutes.To me it just wasn't worth it. I am using my linksys router again and will probably do so until I NEED to replace it. When that happens, I will most likely go with another Linksys product as Linksys has never given me an issue.\n\nAnswer:",

I was very disappointed with the quality of it. The hammer looks like it is sloppily glued together, the case fell apart almost immediately - essentially the set looks and is cheaply made. It's been months since I bought the set (the only reason I'm posting this is because I was going through past orders and was appalled that this set had only one 4-star review!) and I'm not well-versed on the names of different items in the set - but most of the items were plastic and cheap looking. Maybe this should have been obvious from the price, but I was still very disappointed that I spent $50 on something that was more appropriately made to be a play tool kit for a child than to be used to actually do any kind of repairs. My advice - spend more and get something of better quality! We haven't gotten any use out of it.\n\nAnswer:",

It's a simple and effective concept. Our cat lives outdoors (he adopted us) and there is fairly high traffic of feral cats, deer, squirrels and chipmunks, so we mainly have problems with fleas in the yard and garage. When we come into the house we'll always have a few 'passengers' come in with us. I've been using the Victor trap near the garage door and it usually gets a handful of fleas overnight. We have noticed a decrease in flea bites on ourselves, leading us to believe that the trap is a good supplementary defense. I do not, and would not, rely solely on the trap. I spray the garage, distribute granules on the yard and driveway, and use Advantage spot treatment for the cat.I have also found that a disposable plastic plate with a mix of a few drops of dish detergent in water, placed underneath a nightlight, is equally as effective as the Victor flea trap.\n\nAnswer:",

In this tale, Holmes is reduced to a semi-deranged cocaine addict in desperate need of mental help.The amount of plot in this book is about the same as one of Doyle's short stories. A tacked-on chase sequence at the end seems out of place, but since the author is a screenwriter, it is perhaps not surprising.But the worst of all is this, revealed right at the start of the book: Professor Moriarty, Holmes' most dangerous enemy in the real stories, is reduced here to a meek, ordinary schoolteacher. What a ridiculous and depressing idea! I kept waiting for the real Moriarty to show up, but no. Meyer's Holmes has no brilliant enemy to challenge him, just a boring cocaine addiction.

The movie only gives you a glimpse into their lives for a moment and then you see them partying. Nothing else. Also, the foreshadowing is a bit much here.

It protected the seat from scratches and gratuitous amounts of shedding dog perfectly. My dogs are well adjusted to car rides, and thankfully didn't have any accidents, but it definitely feels like it would be water resistant enough to keep the bulk of it from soaking into the seats, though it would probably leak out the sides and through the seat belt slots.Considering the rest of the seat covers around are twice as much, I really don't see how they could be better enough to justify the cost.\n\nAnswer:",

The woman that takes care of her (if you want to call it that) is her father's new wife. Xing Xing has a stepsister who has bound feet and can't walk, so she is treated by her stepmother as though she were a maid.The story is told in the classic tale of Cinderella, with the wicked step-family and the prince trying to find the girl who the missing shoe fits. There is even a great mix of Chinese culture thrown in! I learned a lot about the old (and now mostly) unused tradition of binding a girl's feet.I enjoyed BOUND because I really love the Cinderella story. Xing Xing becomes a character that you want to see succeed and a girl whom you want to find a suitable husband.

It is entertaining, a film parents can trust to allow children of all ages watch, and is equally entertaining for adults. I would by no means put it on par with some of the Disney classics. However, that being said this is by far one of the best films Disney has done in the past 20 years. This film has the feel of one of the classic Disney films prior to the 1980's. A thoroughly enjoyable movie for all ages (I can't say that for all of Disney's recent releases).My version of this movie comes with two short films.

Koss has a good pair of headphones on their hands but it's not durable for the application I use it for. I'm a DJ and during one of my gigs the headphone just broke, I guess it cannot take the stress of DJ use. It broke at the point where the ear cup connects to the headband, Koss used plastic to reinforce that area and it cracked and broked. If Koss would have made that connection out of metal I think it would be perfect. I had to complete my gig with broken headphones which was very uncomfortable. I later customized it into a one earcup headphone since i only needed to listen to my cue points, a month later the other ear cup broke,sound wise it still works. What you get with the expensive headphones is durability.\n\nAnswer:",

There's really nothing catchy about the songs (the exception being \"I Love This Bar\"). This album is primarily filler material. I find that whenever artists release albums fairly quickly, as was the case with this CD, they don't seem to have much to offer. Perhaps Toby Keith should have allowed himself MUCH more time to write a CD with substance after the release of \"Unleashed\". I'm pretty disappointed with the album, and pretty angry that ~$15.00 was wasted on it.As an aside, I find it pretty pathetic that artists are using the 9/11 attacks as a way to make their albums sell.

Reading thru the book I sometimes felt like I could understand what she was going thru. The book is about a young girl named Billie Jo, who does not seem wanted by her Dad or Mom. When a terrible accident occurs she feels all alone, becuase her Dad can not talk about it. The one thing she loves to do she can't, becuase her hands are cracked and sore. Their crops are dying, her best friend just left, they get huge amounts of dust storms, which kill the livestock and the one person who she can talk to is gone. This is a good book to know what it was like in Oklahoma in the year 1934, but even though it is touching it can be kind of hard to follow.\n\nAnswer:",

The tryout process has changed a bit, with the online testing taking the place of sending in a postcard and hoping to be invited to a test, but I can't imagine too much has changed in the production process (especially the strict segregation of clue writers and contestants).The meat of this book is the 10 or so actual games printed in the book, though it's unfortunate that the answer pages (well, technically, the \"question page\", am I right?) are not marked in such a way that you can easily avoid accidentally spoiling your playing along. As another reviewer has mentioned, given the fact that this book is now 22+ years old, some of the clues are dated, but they seem to have done a good job of choosing clues that have stood the test of time.All in all, this book and the Jeopardy!

Once you develop a wood allergy, it never goes away so I am very careful to use this mask.First, if you are going to wear a mask all the time, it has to be comfortable. The #8511 is soft and with the adjustable nose-fit feature, it conforms snugly to the contours of my face. The two elastic straps provide snug but not over-tight contact and, with a little care, I get a close enough fit so that my exhalations do not fog up my safety glasses. The masks are durable and I typically can wear one all day, every day for several weeks (as long as I don't sneeze while wearing it!).The masks appear to effectively remove even fine sanding dust as the inside remains clean and I have developed no allergies after many years of usage.Thanks for another fine product 3M!ROD\n\nAnswer:",

There was some other kid instead of LDB, and he didn't seem to add much to the group. Batman was already taking the lead and was talented at singing slow songs. Romeo was already doing the rapping, although it didn't fit into the songs as well as it does now. This CD isn't up to \"Playtime Is Over\" standards, but some of the slow songs are almost as good.

Having parted ways with their record label and the Hoffman brothers, Deicide has released an album that fans having been waiting years for. Its obvious that Deicide couldnt stand their previous record label; and they released some sub-par albums because they were under contract with them. Lets face it, Insineratehymn and In Torment In Hell sucked. Thankfully, they are done with Roadrunner Records and 2006 is a new era, not only for Deicide, but for heavy music in general.

It seems to have been written by three men who have formed their own post-collegiate fraternity, complete with sticky floor and women of little or no self-esteem. I'm aware of many of the differences in outlook between men and women, but even with those in mind, I'll wait to find a man who has matured more than these three have.In addition, the language, sentence structure, and content structure of the book are written at a very low reading level. Are the authors not able to write at a higher level, or do they assume that women won't be able to understand a more sophisticated read?This book made me alternately laugh and cringe.

I found it too talky and its plot was not believable. It was really hard for me to suspend my disbelief while watching it. None of the characters were endearing and it was a challenge to care about what happened to them. Also, in real life, there would be no chemistry between Downey's character and the female lead, Ms. Monaghan. Her history and the reprehensible manner in which she treats him would preclude his devotion (unless he was a complete masochist). Further, and to my disappointment as I'm an extremely politically incorrect person, I found all the gay jokes about Kilmer's Perry obtuse. I really don't think anyone cares about that stuff much in this day and age. Overall, the interactions are too clever by half, and Downey's narration is a bore. Most of what's supposed to be funny...is not--a waste of time in my view.\n\nAnswer:",

It has difficulties sometime when focusing on something at around 200mm. If you want to have a tele lens and do not want to spend too much money then it is a good choice.I would like to suggest to get the 18-200mm for the convenience if you want to have one lens for everything, especially if you take pictures mostly indoor or in city. If you need a tele lens and you are on a budget, then get the 70-300 for $100 more and get more tele power.It does not work if you use it as one fits all lengs. You can only use it as a tele lens so you will need to switch with another lengs when you are out taking pictures. Also it dost not give you too much tele power.

Only reason I gave it 1 star is because Big Boi had sense enough not to sellout and stuck to being OutKast while Andre tries to be the next Prince. But even Big Boi was barely even trying with his lyrics. The only good songs on Speakerboxx are \"The Way You Move\", \"Bowtie\" and \"Church\".I understand why Hey Ya was #1 on TRL so much, and that's because TRL is a pop video countdown. Dre has definetly sold out. If you wanna hear OutKast and their best, buy Southernplayalisticadillacmuzik, ATLiens or Aquemini (Stankonia was alright, but not as good as their first three).

I don't mind it, I really don't. But the book simply goes too fast, leaping from one topic to another like a flea, never truly going into the minds of the characters with enough detail. For example, did Rachel feel any guilt whatsoever when she killed Tom? I would have liked a little more emotion. It also leaves too much out, like what happened to the auxillary animorphs. Did they all die or something? It would be nice to know what happened to them. It was a good plot, a good idea, but it would have been a lot better if it had slowed down, added a lot more character analysis, and explained things more clearly instead of leaving the readers to do a lot of guesswork. Still, readable and very sad to get to the end... but I would have liked it more if it had slowed down a lot.\n\nAnswer:",

I ended up using the component and audio cables provided by Time Warner with my HD DVR and everything looks and sounds fine.

Much like Bushido Blade, matches play out more like a game of chess than a music video, and this is very good. Frustration enters when you attempt to fight the computer armed with very little idea of how to do anything. For such a deep game, the manual is woefully inadequate. You basically have to learn how to counter moves and switch grappling positions by trial and error. The end result is that your submission moves are usually unsuccessful while the computer's holds almost always put the hurt on you. If you can afford to spend enough time to figure the game out, I'm sure it's immensely rewarding, and for $10 here on amazon.com it's probably worth a shot. I would recommend heading over to ign.com and taking a look at the game guide to get a better idea of what you're getting into first, though. Break a leg. Literally.\n\nAnswer:",

It didn't seem to have the same flow or intelligence of most of the other books, nor was there as much mystery as there was merely adventure. By now I am totally invested in the different characters populating her books, and I definitely wasn't disappointed to see more interaction between the siblings. However, as another poster put it, the ending was so disjointed it was almost like someone else wrote it after reading the last page of the previous chapter. It also left me with the feeling that this was the end of the series, which I hope is not the case.I visit Sharan's website www.sharannewman.com and there was no information about upcoming books, but I certainly hope this isn't the end of Catherine LeVendeur.

With a cast of unknowns or up-and-comers, it would shine as a fun little indie film. But with the comedic talents of Martin, Shandling, Kahn, Sanders, and others, you can't help but wonder why the movie isn't funnier. All complaints aside, it is a good film, as there are countless laughs throughout. But these moments are mostly due to the excellent performances by all (with Liev Schreiber stealing the show in what could have been a very cliche role), rather than the script itself, which seems to be uncomfortable with being a dark comedy, and continuously attempts to redeem itself with sappy couplings and a typical Kapra-esque happy ending. It may not make your list of Holiday Must-See films, but if you aren't expecting a miracle, you should come away happy.\n\nAnswer:",

I use this lens to mostly take pictures of my family. It has great range 18-250 (Minus the conversion factor, it's more like 24-300 I think). Have used it a little taking night shots and it works fairly well. Can't beat it for the price. I'm sure a professional could tell you a million things wrong with it. I haven't noticed any image distortion or fish-eye effect on any images.One thing, I removed the lens hood it came with. It was creating shadows at the bottom of my images.Great travel lens. If you can only afford to buy one lens right now, this is a great all around lens.\n\nAnswer:",

It is not his best either content wise or photo wise. Many of the photos are blurry or look like they were re-touched and look like paintings. I believe this is the first one that he wrote and it shows. That said, the photos are rare and good. He tells a lot of stories about how he got started and how he took some of the pictures. It's pretty funny to hear how he talks about keeping his techniques secret from other wannabe photographers. Petty maybe but nontheless entertaining. Sean's last book called Elvis In Focus is essentially a re-write of this book with better quality. The fact that this book has some different photos and different stories makes it worth finding. A word of caution- the last time I got an e-mail from Sean he said that he had only 2 copies of this book left and if I wanted to know the price I had to ask him. As with all of his books, it is hard to find and expensive.\n\nAnswer:",

One of the inspirations for his memoirs was Napoleon's subsequent denial of the importance of the partisans in this phase of the war. Unsurprisingly, then, the memoirs often seem argumentative, and present themselves as a mixture of personal experience, hearsay information, and analysis. The primary concern is with things that are worthy of being deemed \"history\" in the grand sense, and in order to make historical arguments, Davidov relies heavily on hearsay. Among his goals are (1) to document and to take credit for his own achievements as a leader of partisans; (2) to explain, to analyze and to critique strategic and tactical decisions of other leaders; (3) to explain important military events in terms of their less well-known causes; (4) to share his experience of famous military leaders (he gives a lengthy characterization of Suvorov, and decribes his observations of Napoleon).\n\nAnswer:",

My frame has a small flaw along the inside beaded edge--a 1\" long smooth section that should be beaded.

When the character who will obviously be the next victim is introduced, I groaned. I hoped for a twist or two, but no. A serious disappointment and inferior to at least 100 of the 211 other books I've read this year, including those by William Lashner, John Lawton, Jacqueline Winspear (author of another post-WWI series), Daniel Silva, and the ever-wonderful Donna Leon.\n\nAnswer:",

There are much better episodes in the show, notably some of the multipart arcs, which made this feel average by comparison. Also, they committed a cardinal filmmaking sin by cutting away in the middle of an action scene and resolving it off-camera with little to no explanation. Considering that this DVD costs almost as much as an entire season of the show, it's hard to give it anything more than a lukewarm recommendation.\n\nAnswer:",

The medical descriptions and dialog are real as they can get without bogging down to much in the details and the character development is excellent. The plot is a bit contrived but still believable. Having a notorious criminal getting an operation to change his appearance is one thing, but to have a known world terrorist operated on for a brain tumor and the lengths he goes to have the delicate surgery was a fresh take on the subject. I could easily see this being made into a movie as it moved along at a good clip, kept you guessing along the way and had a character you'd love to hate (the chief of surgery). The book has several subplots which kept your interest throughout and moved the story along. All in alll a very good read. I'll definitely be reading more of Michael Palmer's books in the future.\n\nAnswer:",

What I find unacceptable is the fact that menus must be navigated with the mouse, and cannot be navigated with a joypad. What makes it more bewildering is that this was ported from a console game, where it is expected that the joypad is the only mode of input. Even to dismiss dialogs between quarters you must use the mouse or keyboard. I can't start a game, kick back on my beanbag and play, I need to sit at my desk so I can keep the mouse within reach. If I had known this before I bought the game, I would have bought the PS2 version.\n\nAnswer:",

This blu-ray version has some pluses, the first being how visually clear it is and how vibrant the colors are. It is definitely an up-grade from any standard DVD I have seen. Another plus are the featurettes, one on Gene Kelly which is well done and another on the making of this particular film. Both are very interesting. The only disappointment is the 1:33:1 format - or a standard format. This is a film which should have been done in widescreen - especially the dance sequence at the end. We are so spoiled by all the new productions of musicals in widescreen that it is too bad that this one was done before its time. However, lovers of Gene Kelly and musicals will most likely enjoy having this version in their collection.\n\nAnswer:",

I was once a member of the United House of Prayer for All People for 14 years and unfortunately I didn't get a chance to see Daddy Grace. He died three years before I was born. Nevertheless the wonder about Bishop Grace thrived within me because of the stories my grandmothers told me. My grandmothers were loyal members of Bishop's Grace's church, joining in the early days, and filled my head with stories. They loved Daddy Grace. To be honest, when you interview members of the United House of Prayer for All People you get a one sided view, filled with legends about Bishop Grace. Mr. Davis' book lays out straightforward resources that examine the cult's founder. I didn't know there were so many articles, books, and dissertations written about Daddy Grace. What an interesting character in history he was. Thanks Mr. Davis.\n\nAnswer:",

Plus, it's not really an actual game, so young players might get bored easily with it.The camera is cool; it can swivel around. The downside about that is that young players might accidently twist it off completely, or just damage it out of frustration.The lens can be cleaned with eyeglass cleaner and a soft cloth, preferably the kind you get with your glasses at the eye doctor's office.A young kid could poke a pencil inside and penetrate the lens.My final thought is that is very interesting, very fun, but I would not recommend you to buy this for children under the ages of 8.\n\nAnswer:",

I didn't. It took me about three times as long to read this book as others of similar length and complexity. I will try to read another of Mitchell's books, but it will probably be some time before I do so.The book is a collection of narratives about the life path of a soul in various time periods. I probably would have liked the story better if I had liked the characters more, or if the writing itself had been more compelling. The later is a matter of personal taste, but to me the craftsmanship was not equal to the story. Of the characters, the only ones I really cared for were the woman. The composer whose score the title of the book comes from, I cared for least. The writing styles displayed have been done better by other authors. That said, if you care for literature for litterateurs sake, read the book. It is ambitious and different.\n\nAnswer:",

Bethany is a very accomplished surfer, with endorsements from surfing clothes and board manufacturers, and it's uplifting to know she is still surfing and still doing well in competitions after the accident.

On the upside, the vacuum generates an impressive amount of suction. It picks up pet hair and is great on stairs.On the downside 1) the \"filter\" is not terribly efficient. When you empty the dirt cup make sure to power the unit back on outside - it emits a very substantial cloud of dust when you first turn it on. Better still buy three or four extra filters and wash them between uses. 2) The dirt cup is quite small and requires frequent emptying. This then leads to the problem noted in 1). 3) The slide switch that selects the operating mode and releases the dirt cup jammed. The only way to operate it was to force the switch with a screw driver. Then the switch broke, rendering the vacuum useless. I really miss my dirt devil.\n\nAnswer:",

The acting leaves a lot to be desired, as does the basic script, as if the horrible outline wasn't bad enough, even the actors lines are written by someone who obviously doesn't know how to write, or write for the type of film this was supposed to be.I could not even finish this movie, it was that bad.

I think these two works (together, perhaps, with no. 7 in B flat) to deserve comparison with the Bach Brandenburg Concerti (which are of course the pinnacle of the concerto grosso genre). They are complex, sophisticated, and possessed of an impressive expressive range. This is very emotional music, true to the wont of the Baroque: look elsewhere for something quaint and decorative.The other works here do not quite attain to the standard of nos. 2 and 10, but they are nevertheless thoroughly satisfying pieces and obviously the work of a great master. The performances here are generally lithe and effective, though perhaps just a touch lacking in emotional involvement every now and then. This last is only a very minor complaint, however; I heartily recommend this album.\n\nAnswer:",

There are truly talented musicians out there who struggle for years before landing a record deal, and some never do.

Writers need to write a certain number of articles per year. Each article needs to include a certain number of words. Thus the truth is altered in order to have enough stories and to make each story fill enough space. If you passively read this magazine and many others you are letting yourself be hypnotized into believing a skewed version of reality. If you are reading this magazine with your guard up, retaining your skeptical/analytical mind, then why bother reading it at all?Let your ego go.

The cover and introduction promise stories of crime and misdoings throughout the entire history of the Democrat Party, but much of the book focuses on the last 25 years or so. Scandals involving Roosevelt and other older Dems are glossed over without detail. The writers seem to assume that the reader is already familiar with those events. Much focus is placed on the shenanigans of the Clinton White House, which almost seems to be an issue done to death. Vincent and McCain do bring up several Republican wrong-doers to be fair. I think the writers' strongest point is that while Republicans seem to face up to their crimes or at least have to pay the penalty, Democrats very often do not and are occasionally rewarded for them. This point alone is worth reading the book for.\n\nAnswer:",

The numbers are all in the book. A caution ... the low calorie version of the diet has not resulted in much weight loss. That part has been disappointing, but they do point out that this diet is primarily for blood pressure issues and that weight loss is secondary. It's worth reading.\n\nAnswer:",

This movie would have been extremely funny if they would have toned it down on Ryan's role (the single guy) with all the sex and language. Basically the two guys (Jason - family man & Ryan - Single pot smoking/womanizer) switch bodies & try to deal with each others lives.I would not recommend this movie for anyone that does not enjoy listening to bad language, nudity & sex senses cause there is at least 50%.

In the previous installments he was fun, and while this book focuses on his troubled past with his brothers, he comes across as way too needy. I like the book overall as a conclusion to the August Brothers series. The sex was great, as Lora Leigh really knows how to write them, but it seems like this was not a well thought out story as a whole.

Is he really a master performance artists who lowers himself to the level of his audience? Or is he the borderline retard who doesn't know anything about politics or humor? You decide. All I can tell you is that watching Wally's show on Saturday nights is a bit like taking mushrooms: nothing makes sense. (For the really bold, try doing them both at the same time; it will scar you forever). Anyway, this book sucks just like Wally does.

I was disappointed in Mariette in Ecstacy, but was pleased to find Hitler's Niece a much stronger book. (Mariette was just too darned atmospheric with too little plot or resolution for me.)One of Hansen's strengths, in my opinion, is his ability to render a convincing portrait of an environment dominated by men (probably has something to do with why I prefer the westerns). He's quite successful with Hitler and his inner circle. Hansen's Hitler, manipulative, cowardly, and vain, suited my existing point of view. I also found it oddly satisfying to see Hitler's cronies depicted as loony, dysfunctional social misfits.This story is a train wreck, of course, I knew that Geli would come to a bad end and it would be Hitler's fault, but I kept reading anyway. The weirder the relationship became, the more interested I became, and consequently, the more believable I found the story. I enjoyed it.\n\nAnswer:",

The first 90% of the book is spent explaining why meditation works, its background, and throws in some statistics. If you've already bought into the fact that meditation works as a stress-management tool (lower BP, better sleep, etc), you can skip to the end, or just do a web search on the topic.

The first song was good but,the rest of the album left a sour taste in my mouth. If I had to describe this record I would say it sounds like Atreyu and Avenged Sevenfold had a love child. The guitar is actually really good but, the singing is way too emo for my taste. It isn't very original either.You might even think that you have heard some of these songs on other metal records that recently came out.\"The Poison\" does have it's moments. I liked \"Spit You Out\" and \"4 Words\" alot. Had there been more metal singing, less emo singing, and a little more originality it might have been worth buying. Instead they just leave you wondering if the same people who created N'Sync created these guys. 2 stars weak\n\nAnswer:",

You can't help but adore them--even in the case of John the Bastard, the overly-critical professor of hopeful gondoliers. The ending, overly sentimental for my taste, was a bit disappointing. Overall, the book was not an unpleasant read. When it was out of print, I would have said it wasn't worth the trouble of hunting down a copy.

Throughout the book Cole goes through exciting problems that apparently help him. For instance, Cole gets mauled by the Spirit Bear. After he got mauled another 6 chapters was dedicated to what was happening to him as he was lying on the ground almost dead. After he was rescued from the mauling he had an un-realistic change in personality. He, all of a sudden, wanted to help Peter and other people. The book dragged out what happened to Cole and had over-specific details stating what happened. It has un-realistic consequences to what happens to people when they do something bad. It can teach children that if they do do something bad, they can get different consequences for what they did, even though it was wrong. Do not read this book.\n\nAnswer:",

Just to mention one of them, there is a whole section of the book on things like witchcraft and related practices. It makes the Portuguese look rather superstitious and unpleasant.

(I'm not sure how the Elmer Fudd image came to Matt the reviewer, above, but it certainly couldn't have been from the SOUND of the Harmonists: overall, these guys are silk.) Also, the pianist that accompanies them has a deft way of supporting the vocals without overwhelming them or becoming underwhelming himself. It's a balancing act of pure magic. The Hannibal CD has superb sound quality (considering the age of these recordings)--it really sparkles--and great selections. This is music you can listen to when you're happy, when you're sad, when you want to do a little two-step for the heck of it, when you want to think. It's versatile. It's perfect.

Although Nugent is best known for his ballistic guitar playing, bow hunting and taxidermy skills he is gaining a reputation with jazz insiders for his impressive chops. Many will be surprised to hear this collection of tender love ballads. Fans of Kenny G., Dave Koz and Boney James will surely be amazed by Nugent's fluid playing and true mastery of the sax. Recommended selections include \"Loin Cloth\", \"Bear Naked\" and the album's title track - a duet with Diana Krall. I can't begin to do this stunning album justice. Whether you're enjoying a romantic evening for two or gutting a freshly killed boar - this album is sure to enhance the mood.\n\nAnswer:",

I appreciate the authors no nonsense and humanistic approach to teaching the basics of digital photography. The sections on nighttime shooting, image resolution and color correction were some of my favorites to read. One of the books pluses is that it's loaded with important information and it's easy to read. The downside of this book is the lack of color examples. For example, it's hard to see the effects of lossy, color resolution and photo sharpening with a simple black and white image. I suggest that in thier next book to add more color images for examples. Otherwise this book is worth the money because of the information alone. I would definitely read it again.\n\nAnswer:",

The points that Lakoff and Turner make are very good, very logical, and will make you go \"Of course! Why didn't I think of that?\" It will not only change the way you read poetry, but will impact the way you watch t.v., listen to people speak, read the newspaper - any endeavor involving language. Why the low rating, then? Lakoff and Turner are structuralists, and they repeat everything over and over again, breaking things down to their minute building blocks. They made a very convincing argument in the first chapter, I thought, and didn't need to keep going the way they did. The third chapter, in which they apply their theory to a William Carlos Williams poem is also very good. Those two chapters would have sufficed. Again, an important book, but rather boring at times.\n\nAnswer:",

I purchased this book at the airport thinking that I had found the \"perfect\" book to read on the 4 hour flight from Chicago to San Francisco. I had more fun staring out the window (at night)than reading this book. Darci wasn't that great a character in the first book that she was featured in. And now there is a whole book that is basically dedicated to her. The only thing that I can say about the character of Lincoln Aimes is that he is Ms. Deveraux managed to cram just about every steroetype of the African American male into the character that she could uncaring father, sex crazed, etc.\n\nAnswer:",

Tolstoy rambles too much to make the story truely *interesting*, and Ivan Ilyich's untimely and meaningless end left me wondering \"well, then, what was the point of writing the story?\" The only factor that convinced me to give this book two stars instead of one was that at least the fellow gave it a really good try. Basically, it's too flat to cater to those who enjoy poetic or \"flowery\" writing, any messages Tolstoy manages to put across seem obvious and clich\u00e9d, and the characters have even less depth than the story. Furthermore, Tolstoy's apparent feeling about the nature of humanity is bleaker than Poe's. So if you want to read something meaningful with a mildly religious feel, go for George MacDonald or Peter S. Beagle and at least get a little enjoyment out of it. If you absolutely must read this book, though, take my advice and keep a bottle of Prozac handy. You'll need it.\n\nAnswer:",

The graphics and music are great, but some parts of this game are almost impossible to pass even in easy mode. It took FOREVER to get through, but I finally beat it. However, you have to pass Challenge of the Gods to get some of the unlockables, and these challenges cannot be one under any circumstances. The sixth one has you trying to jump across some moving platforms while guys are shooting arrows at you. The designers give you a whopping 40 seconds to finish it. After two (yes, two!) frustrating hours of screaming and swearing trying to beat it, I ended up getting so mad at it that I snapped the disc in two and threw it out. Do NOT buy this game - unless, of course, you want to get so angry that you throw your controller through the TV screen.\n\nAnswer:",

Screws were small and stripped more easily than the higher quality ones with the other model, which was a little less than twice as expensive. After securing the kickstand in place on my son's 20\" mountain bike, I sat on the bike and leaned on the kickstand to make sure it was secure. I weigh less than 195 lb and have done this on our other 7 bikes with various models of kickstands with no problem. In this case however the piece of pot metal that comprised the primary portion of the kickstand snapped in two. 30 minutes + $12 down the drain!\n\nAnswer:",

There were parts of it that didn't really make sense to me, like how Morgaine, who is in most cases called the Fairy, was against fairies. But there were also parts that were fully engrossing and I really enjoyed. To me, it read like a first draft. It was, however, one of the few King Arthur stories that I could stand to read all the way through. I would have liked to see Arylwren as a slightly more flawed character- she seemed too perfect and benign to be true, while everyone else was a bit of a mess. I think it had gaps, as well. I don't think I would recommend it to other people, but if you enjoy King Arthur tales, then maybe you'll find it better that I found it.\n\nAnswer:",

In the middle of the 80's, some rap artists and DJ's started producing some of their own compilations, thus the name \"House music.\" This movement caught on in Belgium and the UK in 1988 and 1989, with the creation of New Beat. It was a quasi-hypnotic music with much emphasis on dark, sexual overtones and lots of heavy beat and drums. it was played in underground dance clubs and old, abandoned warehouses, sometimes degenerating into all-night drugfests, otherwise referred to as \"raves.\" Although some of this culture was far from exemplary, its musical heritage and legacy are still apparent in today's techno and acid jazz movements.

The problem is the controls are designed around a peripheral, which most of you know, called Twin Sticks. Playing the game with a standard controller IS possible and ALMOST fun, but it's like playing Quake without a keyboard, possible but not tolerable. I purchased the game and decided the Twin Sticks were a must, so I attempted to acquire a set. I found that the controllers go for around $75 each AND even if I felt like sinking $150 into one game I didn't have the option because the controllers are not sold in the US (as of June 2000) and all mail-order shops I found were sold out. So unless you already have Twin Sticks (actually Sega Saturn Twin Sticks work with an adapter) I wouldn't purchase this game. Don't get me wrong, this game is awesome, but true gamers won't be able to put up with the lack of control. ---2 stars, for now\n\nAnswer:",

I think for many fans that this will be the right amount. King is just too good and too prolific for a one disc sampler and 4 CDs is a big box and big bucks for many fans. What this set is missing is the first 13 years or so of BB's career (there were many good songs there), the last decade (still worthwhile music) and just a very light sprinkling of the 1990's. His over 50 year career is just too big even for a big 2 disc set but you will get a lot of quality music at a reasonabale price here. I like the fact that there is some live music here along with the studio cuts.Besides being a great guitarist, King has a great voice, is a fine songwriter and an excellent interpreter of others songs and has had a great stage presence. If you have all that and a little luck, you can be successful for as long as BB King.\n\nAnswer:",

If you haven't, more than likely, you will not like this movie. I have yet, not met one person who hasn't played the Playstaion game yet and not like the movie. To me, this is one of the best Playstation games turn to movies by far, it has played right down to the music and the darkness of the game it self all the way to its disturbing creepiness.The only down side is that yes, the movie is a tad too dark and sometimes makes it hard to see the \"monsters\" and what not, however, thats how the game is played and wasn't really that big of a deal for me. But, the story was decent, the acting was so-so and not a lot of gore within the movie as you would see in the game, but, still not a huge deal. Anyways, if you are a fan of the game, you will truly like the movie. Recommended !\n\nAnswer:",

Not great but not horrible. When it works the way I want to, the blades cut pretty well, and close. However, the main and largest problem is the 5-blade design. With the blades so close together, hair easily gets clogged between them, requiring more work to take out and clean. And clean you must, since it's hard to continue shaving when there's hair worsening the blades' gliding/cutting performance. As for the other users who love this razor, maybe its for some people and not for others (like me), or maybe my hair is too thick. Whatever the case, I recommend you to try this 5-blade razor out before you commit to buying the extra blades.\n\nAnswer:",

However, I soon realized that I was in fact, mistaken. It had been so long since I first heard a ND song for the first time, I forgot that it takes a couple times through the CD before you really pick up on how good it really is. Eventually you find songs stuck in your head and you really start to enjoy singing along with what in reality are VERY catchy songs. The songs are all deep and strong, and closer to the bands roots than TK was. Overall, great release, worthy of the wait.\n\nAnswer:",

Nicholas Cage is about 50/50 when it comes to good films, but Michael Caine looked like he'd carry the story in the previews. I couldn't have been more wrong.Cage is a conflicted character, clearly he's unhappy. He's a bad father and his children and ex-wife are evidence of that as well. The preview made it look like a father-son film about being a better father and better man. For every step forward Cage takes, he takes at least two backwards.The sad part is through all of this conflict, there was a tremendous potential for the character to grow, but that never happens. At the end of the movie you are simply left with a feeling that a point should have been made but never was.\n\nAnswer:",

Since many of the songs were the same, I took a chance that this import was a repackaging of singles.It's not. These are live performances taken off the radio - in fact they sound like they might have been recorded off the air. The sound is tinny and the editing is a bit rough (some songs cut off suddenly during applause, but on another you get to hear Jim clear his throat after a song).After all that though, the album has its charms. The tracks are all live and Jim introduces several of them. If you're a big Jim Reeves fan, this is a chance to hear him in a more open context than a studio album. Still, his voice without any bass does seem a bit of a waste.\n\nAnswer:",

It took a while for me to get into the book. About half way through is when it all comes together. Typical Koontz introducing the characters and it is all needed background but just long winded. The middle to the end of the book is when I couldn't put it down. Wonderful ending and the last half of the book was the best part of this book. I enjoyed it once I got to the middle when the characters started to come together.\n\nAnswer:",

The premise is intriguing as the search for Dracula begins after a prominent professor goes missing. However, despite all the author's attempts at trying to make a suspensful novel, everything ended up being so predictable. The pace of the book is excruciatingly slow, and at times, I felt as though I was reading a textbook on Eastern European history rather than an exciting mystery. I actually fell asleep several times while trying to get through some very verbose and boring history which ended up leading nowhere.This book was not worth reading, the climax is painfully predictable and unclever.

Unfortunately the presentation was biased beyond belief blaming the whole collapse of the mortgage system on George W. Bush. As someone who had researched the subject before seeing this presentation, I was well aware of the fact that this financial disaster went back to the Carter Administration and was pushed through Congress by Cong.Barney Frank, Sen. Chris Dodd and others who believed that everyone had a right to home ownership, even if they could not afford it or worked for it. The presentation clearly showed the pro-Democrat bias of CBS and 60 Minutes. And please note, I am not a Repbulican, just an objective instructor. Don't waste your time on this one.

It's incredibly implausible, as well as horribly acted. I watched it with my dad, who is a HUGE Nic Cage fan and hed went to be half way through it because it was so bad. I hate it when such good actors sell out and make such bad films. At least with Indiana Jones and The Mummy films, I was able to buy into them and suspend my disbelief. With this film, its just so bad that you cant. The movie invovles a series of clues that Nic is amazingly able to figure out, no matter how vague they are. There are a few blunders in this film that were very obvious--poor job on the script editors part. I am in disbelief that this movie made so much money. I think most kids are smart enough to want a better movie. Rent the Indiana Jones films instead. They are good treasure hunting films with great actors, great scripts and so much more fun than this one.\n\nAnswer:",

While I would not use this directly on a wound (it adheres to the skin and is difficult to remove unless moistened with some type of sterile liquid like normal saline) it's efficient and perfect for wrapping and protecting an open-skin type of injury.My only concern is Amazon is describing the product inaccurately and consumers should read the full description as well as the sizes, length and ply to determine which type meets their need. I purchased this item when it was listed as Kerlix Sterile 6 Ply Gauze Bandage Rolls, 4.5\" x 4.1 yards, 60/Cs stored in separate sterile pouches.

This cd is cool though. Each band covers six of the other's songs. It's almost as if they're battling to see who could do it better.Rancid's renditions of \"Stickin in my Eye\" and \"Brews\" definitely did the songs justice. Tim's trademark slur is perfect on \"Bob\". Matt's vocals on \"Don't Call Me White\" crack me up. He sounds like he's going to eat someone!NoFX nailed \"I Am The One\". Jokingly slurring \"Olympia, WA\" keeps it entertaining. The reggae version of \"Radio\" admittedly took awhile to grow on me, but I love it now.All around good split; it's fun to hear two bands that really are friends impersonating each other.

For the Queen album in question, a medley extends through songs three (\"Tenement Funster\"), four (\"Flick of the Wrist\"), and five (\"Lily of the Valley\") for a total of 8 minutes and 17 seconds. The medley starts to ring in my head as soon as I think of it: heavy power cords, dramatic changes in tone from soft to heavy, from serious to flamboyant. The medley is followed by \"Now I'm Here,\" which has more fun dramatic changes. I once heard Queen referred to as a heavy metal band, and track 8 (\"Stone Cold Crazy\") could attest to that. Most people, however, would probably argue against such a label; but man, does Queen love its head-banging moments!\n\nAnswer:",

After hearing so many people saying how much they thought this was funny and great, I looked forward to seeing this movie. I saw it last night and almost fell asleep. I think I laughed once throughout the whole movie. I love Kevin James and he's always funny in the King of Queens, but this wasn't the way he should have broken out into film. Will Smith was way too smooth and Amber Valeta should stick to modeling while she still has half her looks. Even if this was truely funny, all the funny parts have been shown on TV Trailers for so long, that the semi-good parts weren't new to me.

I ordered 2. Once they arrived, the quality of the construction seemed to be pretty decent. I left the next day on a business trip to Spain.

Once I posted my initial seller feedback, the company contacted me immediately offering to replace the adapter at no charge. I certainly appreciated the offer, but it wasn't going to do me much good now...maybe for the next trip. These are a great buy at this price, but just be careful to test them with a continuity meter or something before you travel with them just in case you have an experience like mine.\n\nAnswer:",

It sounded like Rage was trying to rap Aaron's lyrics. Anyway, if Aaron had sampled this CD, I would have hoped he'd have gone and kicked Rage Against the Machine's a$$.

It doesn't get much simpler than this. The cards are layed out and you start rolling the dice to win \"prizes.\" Even though you win one, it can be won from you by another player if they roll what is needed. The winner is the one with three prizes at the BEGINNING of their turn. This makes for a lot of passing and rooting for someone else. I like that.The only real draw-back to the game is that so many prizes are almost impossible to get and usually the same ones get tried for over and over again. This can make for a longer game than necessary. And, if you're playing with people who are not risk takers, the game gets a little slow and predictable.The low educational rating is due to the fact that the game doesn't require that player to do anything but count and remember.Overall, this is a great little game to buy for the whole family. This is not a good game for teens or a primarily adult crowd.\n\nAnswer:",

The only problem so far has been getting my cockatiel to acknowledge its presence. (So far she's alternated between refusing to look at it and stepping over it with great disdain...) However, even though she won't actually sit on it, it does help keep that part of her cage a little toastier than the rest of the room, which is good. It would be much improved if there was a dial to allow adjustment; I think she'd like it better if I could turn the temperature down a bit.

There are many programmed musical selections, and the toy bar can be placed within easy reach of little hands. The only problems I can see are 1) there are only 2 settings for the toy bar position, so some babies may need to deal with having it too close because the length of their arms have not caught up with the distance of their sight; 2) the music bar does not automatically run through an entire song if you press it repeatedly. Our 3-month old likes to grab on and wave the music bar in the middle back and forth, so we get to enjoy the beginning of every song, yet never hear them the whole way through. The lights on this are entertaining, and the vibration level is just right. The whole bouncer is light enough to transport baby from room to room without having to take her out.\n\nAnswer:",

I have this litter box in titanium, and I think it's as attractive as an indoor outhouse can possibly be. The lid is excellent at keeping flying litter in so far, and it's roomy enough for my 9 month old cat. My kids ripped and flung a few things in their excitement to get all set up for the new kitty, and so the charcoal filter went uninstalled for a few days. Sadly, I can honestly say I notice no difference at all in the level of odor after installing the filter. And no difference at all between the odor from this box and the small cheap-o open box we had at first.That said, I'd still buy it again for the sleek look, compact size and the nice enclosure. I wasn't really expecting it to smell good-- it's a box full of leavings, after all-- but I definitely expected it to contain the litter. And at that it's doing a great job.\n\nAnswer:",

It made for an easy read. I felt like I had a good sense of Weill's character and business style by the end of the book. The only criticism I would make is that the book seemed like an \"authorized\" biography in that it was overly flattering of Weill at times - like commending him for his restraint in only having three large mansions. Also, like all biographies written during the person life, there needs to be more chapters for events that take place after the book stops. In spite of that, I recommend the book to anyone who likes good biographies of business leaders.\n\nAnswer:",

The handle and strap for the bag feels cheap and with such a large laptop I question it's longevity. The strap isn't padded but has a rubberized shoulder protector. This bag is a fine short term solution until a person can save up for something more rugged. I'm concerned long term use will lead to the handle failing and my laptop on the ground broken.

The game is entirely a side-scrolling fighter (except for the occasional forgetful mini-games)and you'll fight 3 or 4 of the same enemies over and over again on a level, then it's off to the next level to fight the next 3 or 4 new enemies over and over AND OVER. I was prayiing that each level would end before it ever began. This is just too bad because the sound samples and amount of unlockable content made me want to keep playing; sadly the repetitive gameplay overshadows anything positive the game can offer.

What's new is: 1. you very likely have a computer with a CD burner and 2. a 1GB SD card (enough to hold a CD) costs under $20, making recording either direct to CD or to hard disk less attractive.These days, for transferring vinyl or cassette to CD or MP3, I would recommend something like theEdirol R-09 WAVE/MP3 Recorder. Plug it into your stereo to record, and then carry it (or its memory card) to your computer. Edit and mix to taste, then burn. Do not be put off by the fact that this device looks nothing like a stereo component; rather, put it in your pocket and record your kid's recital, in higher quality than you can imagine if the last time you tried was on cassette.\n\nAnswer:",

What I find interesting in his books is that you can always guess what he's been reading recently. For instance, this book reminds me of Atonement by Ian McEwen, in being about an elderly writer looking back on her adolescence, which includes a climactic rape. There is also the possibility that she, as a writer, has edited her version of the past as a protection for someone or atonement for something.That said, this is not your standard Barnard mystery, with deliciously nasty characters and a real puzzler that only resolves in the last few lines. It's more of a character study--interesting, but not a page turner.\n\nAnswer:",

I bought new carpet 7 months ago and figured it was time to buy a REAL vacuum.As a bad back sufferer, I needed something that was easy to push, lightweight, etc. I read just about every review out there and decided on this one. Walmart had it for 167.00, online only. I printed out the page and brought it to PC Richard here on Long Island. They honored it and beat the price for $165. It's a snap to assemble. 2 connections and your done. I vacuumed my 2 carpets with ease. With the brush spinning, it's easy to push around. Since my carpets hadn't had a great cleaning in months, I set the brush on full spin. Upon emptying the cup, I discovered ALOT of carpet frizz. Seems like the brand new brushes trimmed my carpets a bit. BE CAREFUL with the brushes. Next time, I'll just use the vacuum with either no or light spin. Other than that, I'm glad I bought this.\n\nAnswer:",

You look up the activity you do and the book matches it with the right stretches. The stretching routines are long, but there are a lot of muscles to be dealt with.

It is another in the slew of mystery novels featuring Britiesh gentlemen detectives, combining crime solving with personal dilemmas. This is similar to books written by Ruth Rendell. What I liked best about the book was the descriptions of Cambridge, which brought back my own university days. What I liked least was the murder plot - this writer is so good that I don't think she needs to rely on formula. She would do just fine writing straight literary fiction.I read this several years ago and then reread it - I didn't realize that I had already read it till half-way through, so I guess it is not a particularly memorable book.\n\nAnswer:",

The author clearly states in the preface what her goals were in writing this book, which I think she does a great job of. However, being knowledgeable in the science field myself, I feel that there are a few flaws in her presentation of some of her research. I think at times it leaves one open to question the validity or the specific correlations of some studies mentioned.Overall, one does get a pretty good depiction of \"medical apartheid\" and it's definitely a VERY scary one!

Even though All-Clad is much more expensive, you're better off going with their chicken fryer because they bolt the handle to the basin (whereas Innova just staples the handle on).

I bought the Vista Cx because I thought the built-in barometric altimeter would reduce the problem with satellite determined elevations - it does not. The expected error in elevation is 50 to 200 feet, far worse than the positional accuracy of the gps. To reduce error Garmin recommends calibrating the unit every hour to a known elevation - if you know the elevation that well you don't need a gps! So, while you marvel at the positional accuracy of the unit you can still expect to get a good laugh from the elevations.\n\nAnswer:",

While it places a large focus on the high monetary cost of being a scientologist in good standing (purchasing dianetics), it fails to explain where that money goes. According to the documentary, it doesn't go to the majority of the members, because it makes their minimal pay very apparent. Does it go to helping the destitute? If so, they should be applauded for their efforts. Does it line the pockets of high ranking church officials? If so they should be ashamed. But the documentary never addresses this seemingly obvious issue. Although it allows some frustrated people to feel that they have a voice, which is good, I think it is pretty shallow in its approach and would have been better had it delved into deeper issues.\n\nAnswer:",

Similar in sound to Judas Priest and similar in pure energy to Metallica(Kill 'em All), Show no Mercy exhibits a sound that would never be heard again by Slayer or by any other thrash band of the decade. The lead work is brilliant, the vocals are dynamic, and the lyrics are a prime example of the band's Satanesque gimmick. I wish that the rating system would allow for a 4.5 star rating, because that is what I would officially give this album. Songs like \"Die by the Sword\" and \"Crionics\" are powerful while \"The Antichrist\" and \"The Final Command\" are blazing fast. The album is well rounded and welldone. It can't be recommended for everyone; opinions are relative, but any fan of Slayer or thrash metal in general will find this one to be worth hours of listening.\n\nAnswer:",

While other labels (RMM, Concord) lay on the smooth production, Cubop stays true to the roots, emphasizing the clav\u00e9, horns, and percussion that are at the music's core. \"Viva Cubop: Jazz and the Afro-Cuban Way\" is a 13-song sampler featuring the legends and new cats that are keeping the music vibrant and alive. Artists like conguero Francisco Aguabella, one of Cuba's greats; Papo Vazquez, who fuses Afro-Caribbean rhythms with his sensatational trombone playing; Bobby Matos, a leading figure in Latin Jazz; John Santos, a master of percussion; and London's Snowboy, who popularized the music in Europe.

The bulk of this book is on battle moves, and they have a ton to show you. Everything from chops and punches to roundhouses and elbow strikes is right in this book from many different angles. The only reason I gave this book four instead of five stars is because I really think they could have gone into more detail on the muscle systems, and there are no weapons in this book.

The tray that they (or toast) sit on is not solid, but rather a series of protrusions in alternate directions. It is very easy to put a Pop-Tart too far to the side, so it will go down but then only come partially up, and get eaten by the toaster. If you're even less careful, you can entirely miss the tray altogether so things go down but never come back up.As someone else said, it's weird that the cord is in the front. The cord is also fairly short, so you pretty much have to sit it sideways on your counter.But it does a good job on toast. Haven't tried the bagel button yet. And it was very inexpensive at the grocery store where I purchased it, so overall it's ok.\n\nAnswer:",

It goes through A LOT of batteries, way more than the average person would ever want to place in a wireless keyboard and mouse. The keyboard and mouse never shut off so even when your computer is off you are still losing battery power. I brought this back out last week sometime and have been using it and taking the batteries out when I am done. In the middle of typing last night the keyboard completely stopped working. Tried everything to get it to work with no avail. The only way it does work is if I hold the keyboard so it is vertical and try to type like that. Definitely not worth it and I would invest in a better set.\n\nAnswer:",

If you can conceive of the melodic abilities of Pavement combined with the quirky songwriting of Guided by Voices, and throw in a little Ween and Wilco, you have a bit of an idea of what you'll get here. But Flaming Lips may be the best of the bunch. Oh, below, someone rated it poorly and said it sounds like Neil Young in his Trans phase? Well, there are some to whom that couldn't be higher praise. I agree, and that's why I love the record (and if they want to go on reminding people of Neil Young, who could argue with that?). Really, the only things that link this music to Neil is the strong songwriting, freedom from formula, lively intelligence and strong melodic sense. And that ain't bad at all.\n\nAnswer:",

I really did. Totally didn't understand it and was expecting accessible pop gems like \"Sing It Back.\" Or maybe that first day I just wasn't in the mood to listen to an incredible piece of pop art like RUBY BLUE. Because it is amazing. Roisin's voice is flawless and Herbert pushes the concept of music with bizarre arrangements and creative sounds. The only weak spot on this album is the very last song-- I haven't even taken the time to remember what the name of it is. But it's boring and it just doesn't hit me. But the rest of the album is perfect to put on when you're laying by the pool on a hot summer day-- or just laying anywhere. I'm looking forward to what Roisin has to offer in the future. I just hope some US record exec gets wise and they start releasing her albums over here.\n\nAnswer:",

Feeling the heat one minute and realizing the electrical inside tripped/burnt, I now had a nice paper weight. I didn't bother with trying to return it because I am outside of the 1-year warranty... hmm... maybe that's why there is only a one-year warranty? I definitely recommend NOT buying this product.

He is that good. All the basics of Frankie's music are here covering most of his albums. For those that haven't heard Frankie, I always described him as a cross between Rod Stewart and Bob Seger but with his own distinct sound. Some are bluesy others more rock, some that have a country sound, and many great ballads. He is one of the all-time greatest voices and was an in-demand song writter. Outstanding combination.

I was literally salivating at the Cambridge book stall. Everything looked so great, but as a student you have limited funds. Suddenly an older woman walked up to me, recognized my bibliophile stupor and asked if I was a new teacher. I answered yes and she grabbed this title and \"Discussions That Work\" by Penny Ur. These two books have been invaluable in my teaching for the past five years. The activities are well organized and the explanations help as a springboard for my own ideas. As with all Cambridge series, the preference is British English, so if you are a purist, some activities are not readily available for American.

Much likeSix Feet Under, Towelhead explores dysfunctional family relationships as experienced through the eyes of a 13-year-old Lebanese-American girl.Many of Ball's familiar themes are present here - sexual awakenings, sexual deviance, abusive families - and as usual he handles the themes with an uncomfortable sensitivity. There are plenty of moments which you'd rather not be sharing with the troubled characters, but the film compels you to watch.The film medium perhaps suits Ball's subject matter better than TV. Where Six Feet Under often threatened to destabilize its credibility with the implausible bad luck that his central characters endured, Towelhead manages to maintain its focus, offering up a tenderly traumatic, and darkly humorous story of Jasira's coming of age into an increasingly sexualized world.\n\nAnswer:",

Good cast and a great tv show that has become a movie. I am not one that normally complains about language in a movie, but in the first 20 minutes of the movie I bet they don't go 90 seconds with out someone saying the F word or worse. The story week and most of the humor wasn't what I think is funny. A few good spots here and there but overall BAD. I haven't seen a movie this bad in years.

But, there are several issues that are a pain-in-the-butt.First off, if you are watching anything and hit stop to go into the setup, or even shut the player off, and then go back to the show, the player starts the show over. Most regular players will pick up where you left off. I've called support. They tell me that not all discs have that option. Huh? I have 8 movies and none of them do it. I don't have the problem on a couple of SD DVDs that I've tried.Secondly, if I put in a SD DVD and try to start it in anything other then 480 an error message will be displayed that states it is an illegal operation and will automatically change the setting to 480p. If you are playing the disc and stop it to enter the setup to make the change the player will automatically turn the format into 4:3. Support says it's normal. I also have a Sony DVP-NS90V for upconverting and I don't have a problem with that.[...] Great picture, tho.\n\nAnswer:",

Great music stirs something inside the listener, and matters to the person who created it. Britney Spears and the ridiculous product that her record companies have created is none of these things. It saddens me to see the number of copies an album such as this sells originally. And yet, the great albums of all times sell thousands of copies years - decades, even - after their release.

From an Audiophile standpoint, the sound quality is just not that good compared to other recordings. I also agree with the previous reviewer that the camera work is laughable. I've seen better video of my kids soccer games.

Even the format of this book was confusing. This novel was split into two parts, a tale of a man and a tale of a woman. I give the author some credit for writing a novel vividly, painting imaginations into the reader's head. However, I disliked the way that he failed to connect the 'two' stories together.

The two problems I have with it are as follows:1) The material that holds the USB devices in is plastic. To me that is not the best material. It seems it could break/rip off from the rest of the material very easily. It should have been made from a thin elastic material. I think that would hold up much better.2) The two sides are held together by a small piece of velcro. This leaves the sides open to wear dust/dirt can get in. I would have liked to pay a little more for something that zips maybe. Or at least seals all the way around.Overall, it does its purpose. I hope it holds up.\n\nAnswer:",

The restored footage is fantastic - buy it for no other reason than to hear Cool, Cool, Considerate Men. An outstanding musical number, which of course makes Dickinson's motivations much clearer than in the cut up version released in theaters. There is much more dialogue debating independence, which is most welcome. Also, some rather saucy dialogue concerning the establishment of prostitutes in New Brunswick near the Continental Army camp. 1776 is one of my favorite musicals, and was always a MUST see every July 4, until it was no longer shown in my area. I had to content myself to singing along with the CD of the original Broadway version. I would rank the film version at least in my top five favorite movie musicals, along with Singin' in the Rain, Meet Me in St. Louis and Kiss Me, Kate. You won't be disappointed!!\n\nAnswer:",

While it fills time between Murakami books, I find both strength and weakness in its form (a story told through a series of letters exchanged by former spouses who have been apart for 10 years). The problem with writing a book in the form of letters is: 1. the author's need to maintain proper writing (grammar, punctuation etc.) at the expense of the character's natural writing style (are they both such perfect writers? we'll never know); and 2. the hard-to-ignore fact (perhaps just in this case) that the letters are indeed written by the same person (the author).

The rest of the musicians are OK, the vocals weak, but John Cippollina's talent was on an entirely different level and very little of his work was recorded. The strongest lyrics here are on Hamilton Camp's old folk song \"Pride Of Man,\" but the best QMS moments for me were always instrumental. Dino Valenti was in jail and did not appear on this recording which gets it an extra half star from me. There were better bands overall around back then but John Cippollina didn't play in any of them. This was a great band live so of course their label never bothered to put out a live recording. I still listen to it a couple times a year after 40yrs which can't be said of many other recordings of the period.\n\nAnswer:",

It has been a blast traveling around the state and looking first hand at what is found in the pages of \"Ghost Towns of Wisconsin\".As an example... The location of the ghost town \"Gratiot's Grove\", it's just 3-4 miles south of Schullsburg just south-east of the intersection of Rennick Rd. and Cty. Hwy U. There are still some cellar holes visible and if you use your imagination, you can see where the city roads were using the size of the massive oaks as an indication. I found Gratiot's Grove using the book. There is also the Gratiot house which is on the north side of Rennick Rd. It's the 4th oldest private wooden structure in all of Wisconsin. It had partially burned sometime in the 1930's but the main structure is still intact.\n\nAnswer:",

All the needed hardware was enclosed to make it possible to mount this bracket to wall studs or to a concrete wall (glad I did not have to do the latter installation though). Once the bracket is in place, you can adjust your viewing angle up to 12 degrees and have a bit of room for lateral positioning the TV as well. My son and I successfully installed both the bracket and TV in less than an hour, and much of that time was spent measuring and positioning before we committed to a location.\n\nAnswer:",

So needless-to-say I was psyched when summer rolled around and I was able to pick it up and devour it.The book began well but that's it. 100 pages in I was still waiting for character development and a tangible plot. The entire book was one huge rant about how bitchy Andrea's boss was. I felt like saying, \"OK, we know this - now please move on.\"Unfortunately, the scenes (and demands from the boss) were unbelievable (even by chick-lit standards).However, it was funny (maybe because the bitchy demands from the boss were sooo over the top). It is something to read if you have nothing else to read, but this book does not live up to it's NYTimes Best Seller List push.This book should not be compared to Nanny Diaries.

I think because it's too much influenced by old classical music, the kind I also do not like.With the bands \"Yes\" and \"Strawbs\", the progressive trend and orientation of the rest of the group was perhaps forcing Wakeman to dig in that same direction, and that resulted in some really outstanding musical discoveries.But left alone...Maybe another reason for me not to like the solo albums is my tendency to favor music in minor (which sounds rather sad) as opposed to music in major (which sounds more \"happy\" if I can say that)Apart from this, I have to agree that Wakeman is technically very powerful. And lots of my friends did love these albums at the time they came out.So I suppose it's purely a question of taste in the end.\n\nAnswer:",

I think you should save the money and just use an overturned box or laundry basket. Same effect.The only upside is that she enjoys the car mode when I push her.

Perhaps because the idea is good? \"An intelligent Iranian women giving insight on life and struggles in Iran\" sounds like it would make a fantastic book. Maybe it will make a good book some day.

Instead of mimicking the tried-and-true journalistic voice of authority, the author lets his subject do most of the talking, about baseball in general and the Red Sox in particular, as well as on things that have little to do with sport but are nonetheless interesting, such as the Ramsey murder, life in the Army during the Vietnam era, race, and psychology. In one lengthy passage, the author uses old and new James analysis to make a case for Lou Whitaker being severly underrated and having had more value to his teams than Ernie Banks or Lou Brock to theirs. Whether you agree or disagree, or you like Bill James or don't, this book is pretty fascinating. Some reviewers have complained about the structure, but I found it a fun and easy read. If you're a Red Sox fan, you'll dig the \"Pedro Martinez / London pub\" story.\n\nAnswer:",

I asked for it - by model number - so nobody to blame but myself. I was surprised to find the power cord is only a foot long - if that! I don't know about you, but I rarely park that close to an outlet. Even if I did park right next to one, the outlets in my garage are high enough that the compressor would have to hang from it's own cord. It would not reach the floor. Maybe building code varies from region to region, but outlets in my garage were part of new construction - not added by the owner incorrectly.This will work fine for the person looking to inflate an air mattress/sports ball. There is no reason you could not do so indoors - using an outlet just above the floor. But if they really think this is convenient for the person looking to check and inflate their tires, they have to think again! I will need an extension cord at all times to use this in a garage.

Dale Hawkins was one of many rock & roll/rockabilly acts strutting their stuff in the late 50's who earned the distinction of being the most recorded of all white artists on the Chess label. Dale toured mainly with black R&B artists at that time before taking up recording duties in the 60's with the likes of Bruce Channel, Five Americans and Nilsson. More recently, he was responsible for producing the recent CD for Kenny Brown, the former RL Burnside sideman. \"Wild Cat Timer\" jumps out of the speakers from the opening title cut and continues in a similar vein taking on board a mix of swamp, blues, country and of course rockabilly. The playing throughout is loud, loose and jumping. Buy it before Dale takes time out for another 30 years to record his next gem!\n\nAnswer:",

However, when the product arrived, it was considerably heavier than past shoes I've purchased. The sole is now molded to the upper shoe, so that when the soles wear out, the shoes are basically finished. Prior Rockports were easily resoled due to how they were constructed.

It also gives an interesting angle on Australia's convict past, and the workings of class structure.

Obviously there will be references to the importance religion plays in their lives. The plot started out interesting but soon turned boring. I forced myself to finish the book.

The stories about Conlon's police work might strike some as repetitive, but what the police do IS repetitive. If they are on the drugs beat, for example, they don't investigate bank robberies. They deal with drugs, day in and day out.

The They are naive \"musicians\" who are stuck in the hackneyed genre of punk/emo/screamo. A few days ago I went a 30 Seconds to Mars Concert, and opening for 30 Seconds to Mars were a number of other bands, one of them being Aiden. I was very excited to see how this band was, because most of the people around me were praising the band, making them even more alluring. Soon enough I was privy to the exalted band that was Aiden, but they certainly were not all they had been built up to be. Constant, blaring power chords, off-key screaming and \"singing,\" and constant cursing seemed to be what this band was all about. Their songs were terrible, and the band got off time on many occasions. Aiden is just another typical screamo band that is ONLY out there to make money. Sorry for anyone who adores this band, but this is NOT music... Pick up a guitar and take lessons for three months and you could be in this band.\n\nAnswer:",

The CD is packaged with a styrofoam sheet to make the package look more bulky, like maybe a booklet comes with it or something! Don't be fooled. There's nothing to this but the classic recorded short story, the box, and some styrofoam.

It can be read as stories from a storybook, but this storybook is a collection taken out of a larger work called Srimad Bhagavatam - a holy book from India. I said deceptive because it is not a children's book, but is far deeper. The tales are constructed to raise consciousness. This book did raise my own consciousness.The stories are well written in English, and are captivating. The book is not unlike stories taken from the Bible, but of course the characters are very different.

The one important feature missing is dial back of numbers shown in caller ID. It saves the 10 digit area code and number, i.e. 555-555-1234. If you press \"display dial\", it dials those 10 digits. In my area, like many, I think, there are times when you must only dial 7 digits, and other times when you must dial \"1\" plus the area code and then 7 digits. Dialing all ten digits for a call within my same area code won't go through, nor will a call outside my area code without a \"1\" before the 10 digits. I have other Caller ID Phones that prompt for these rules during set-up so that they know how to return calls with a one touch call back of the caller ID number shown. This one doen't.\n\nAnswer:",

The songs on this album do not flow together to create one epic, like some of HUMs classics. Since the songs kind of stand on their own, I would have thought the songwriting to be a little more prolific. No one song really stands out to me. Tracks 6 & 7 sound like they belong on Smashing Pumpkin's \"Siamese Dream\", which was groundbreaking in 1993. After reading reviews that compared this work with some of Pink Floyd's, I am not seeing the connection.

However, the more I attempted to use it, the more it seemed to use too many words to say too little. This may be because it is translated from German, perhaps lacking the flow and comprehensibility of the original text. Either way, the card \"interpretations\" are far from concise and tend to meander, resulting in a rather unfocused treatise, sometimes verging on pedantic... The \"biographical\" section on Crowley seems a bit questionable... \"The Crowley Tarot\" does have some redeeming qualities, however; the numerous card spread systems are well illustrated and explained, and the \"music\" and \"art\" correspondences for the trumps are interesting.A difficulty arises in recommending a clear and informative work on Crowley's tarot. ...

Apparently one of the screws was so tightly fastened into threaded brass ferrule that the ferrule actually \"spun\" in the plastic receiver that was holding the brass ferrule into which the faceplate screw was fastened. This necessitated the removal of the faceplate by \"coaxing\" it off the switch box faceplate mounting screws. Then, after remedying this solution, the switch operated properly for two days, and then commenced to function properly only sporadically. I returned it for credit.

This whip instructor looks like he is just swinging wildly about as he attempts to show different strikes with the whip. In theory he has some good information, but the execution is less than poor. In comparison with several other cracking videos I recently received, the professional crackers show much more finesse and fluid movement and frankly I would be much more frightened to attack one of them than this guy. As I said, he really knows how to fight, but I would recommend he take some lessons on how to crack and then re-shoot his video. I was disappointed with this video.\n\nAnswer:",

My son cried endlessly, especially when Elmo bent over laughing and touched my son's leg. He pushed Elmo away and was scared to have him nearby. I was a bit nervous he was scarred for life and wouldn't want elmo again, but once we turned him off and put him aside, he reluctantly gave Elmo a hug. Anyway- bottom line is don't get too crazy about this toy if you can't find it. My son would have loved any Elmo just as much, and probably would prefer one that didn't \"attack\" him.\n\nAnswer:",

Except for the usual cadre of 10 songs heard on classic rock stations all the time in the Rust Belt, I had no idea that the Stones could make compelling music, and this album didn't help matters much. It took me years of bumbling around to find the really good stuff on the earlier albums. As for this taken on its own terms, there ARE some good songs here, peppered with filler. I particularly liked \"Time Waits for No one\" and \"Till the Next Goodbye.\" Languid but good mid-tempo stuff.

Given that he explains the meaning of the words when introducing a chant, I'd have to say he understands.At one of these workshops, I learned the story of how Dave came to chanting. He originally went to India with a documentary film team. He became so enthralled with the chanting he encountered there that he ended up staying and studying there, immersing himself in the culture and the language.Some of the songs (e.g., \"I and Me\")on Brink seem to bring an American sensibility to the concept of chanting. This could confuse or annoy purists, but one of the things about Stringer that appeals to me is his ability to convey the universal aspects of chants.It's hard for me to imagine what this album would sound like to someone who has not seen Dave's passion in action, but it is both deep and light-hearted, an important contribution to the chanting genre.\n\nAnswer:",

The Wallflowers' previous album BRINGING DOWN THE HORSE left me stunned, and had awesome, real, lyrics. Breach seems to be a stark contrast. The lyrics have an apathetic, \"looking-down-on-you\" attitude which I'm not too fond of. Although I appreciate the quality of the folk-rock style music, the lyrics make me feel cold inside, they feel so hollow. I'd prefer much more wholesome BRINGING DOWN THE HORSE much more than this.\n\nAnswer:",

(Dr. Key is a strong believer of \"subliminal advertising\" who actively travels the country giving guest lectures and writing many books about this subject. Dr. Key is fueling the fire about the myths of subliminal advertising.) It was very difficult to write my 25 page research paper over a book that was written at about 7th grade level.

There are some good tunes on the album notably \"The bomb\" and \"Give it all your heart\" (which at 7.39 is the longest track).It has to be said that this an album for Hancock completists only\n\nAnswer:",

He really doesn't have the space to discuss many relevant Biblical citations. The book's chapter on the finality of Christ is excellent though.

So-and-so goes to the bathroom. So-and-so puts her hand on his shoulder. So-and-so stares forlornly at the painting. Not only that, but the payoff is bankrupt. At least with the plot-shallow \"Da Vinci\" we have a sprint and come across the finish line feeling like we accomplished something. With \"Historian,\" the only thing we accomplish is burning a few calories for having to carry around a tome of this size.Kostova needs to learn how to do a little more plot blooming as it happens, instead of waiting entirely until the end. It's okay to reveal key facts and let the audience know that they're key as they happen, instead of just rehashing the same facts over and over ad nauseum to string us along until the end.

Most of the material is his well-known novelty music, while a few are based on his relatively obscure electronic music. This is a nice recording but not a vital one, unless one is a major Scott fan.The band has a nice French cafe sound, effected by the accordion and zither, and the arrangements are jazzy and touch on a variety of styles, from cakewalk to early rock and roll to a John Barry/James Bond quality, and are all well done without being particularly exciting or adventurous. The mixing is a little dense, and the band is let down by a rather lugubrious drummer. My personal feeling is that Scott's work is crying out for a treatment a la what John Zorn did on the incredible 'The Big Gundown' for Ennio Morricone's movie themes.

While Carole was understandably scared and vulnerable, she naively allows herself to be tortured by Eddie & Naomi for a good portion of her young life.The story picks up and moves a bit quicker toward the last quarter, has a few interesting twists. But by the end, I was mostly just irritated because the only reason Carole was trapped by her secret was because she allowed herself to be trapped to begin with. Generally speaking, most of the characters were too shallowly drawn to allow the reader to become fully engaged in Carole's story.Although Speak Softly's not bad, it's certainly not great.\n\nAnswer:",

It works very nicely, though I sometimes nearly burn myself when carrying the mug with hot water when I'm not careful. The glass gets hot very quickly, and the handle is small. Similarly, when I remove the infuser from the mug, there is not an easy way to do so without touching the hot metal. If you're interested in this style infuser, which I am convinced produces superior tea to ball or spoon infusers, go for it. You might also consider purchasing just the infuser and using it with your favorite mug instead.\n\nAnswer:",

It was a fabulous way to introduce Cervantes and this beautiful story. I immediately went home and asked my mother if she'd ever seen it--she had the soundtrack on vinyl and CD. After listening to the original Broadway cast and watching this video again, I noticed a few things: 1) Peter O'Toole really looks the part, but should not be allowed to sing. 2) Ditto for Sophia Loren. 3) I would have missed out on this wonderful music if not for this video, even if I later decided it was a bad movie.

Now, I like the idea of time travel and can get lost in that concept, but, there were many other added magic touches that were too much, such as; mind melding, changing the future to suit Lisa, and going back in forth in time like you would go on vacation. The ending seemed rushed and too \"happily ever after\".

Up to a maximum of three devices can be hooked up simultaneously to the switch. A fourth optical cable will be needed to attach to your receiver or whatever device you are routing your sound through.The cables snap in tightly and the switch itself locks into place on the input you have selected. Since there is no power cord required, installation should take only minutes. If your AV equipment is lacking a suitable number of inputs, this switch will enable you to hook everything up quickly and easily.\n\nAnswer:",

I wrote a review on this book April 3rd when I was in 4th semester of Cisco Networking Academy. I have taken the exam since then. I made an 869 and passed. This was a hard test even with the Academy, Todd Lammle's book and the Cisco Press stuff. Don't let all of these rave reviews and phenomenal scores bowl you over. A word to the wise, study everthing you can get your hands on. This book was very readable unlike the Cisco Press material. The CD questions gave me a false sense of security. They were nothing like the exam. ISDN was stressed heavily on the test and it was pretty light in the book. I recount my rating to 4 stars because, with this book alone you will not pass the exam if you are completely new to this field. You will get some good basic concepts down and it is a good read. On to CCDA, I'll pack a lunch for this one.\n\nAnswer:",

It struck me as an ambitious mess, at times, even crude, hardly crying out for a \"re-make\". Unfortunately, egos not reasons rule in Hollywood.That said, I have enjoyed the non-commercial films of Mr. Soderbergh (THE LIMEY; sex, lies, and videotape,etc.) as opposed to his commercial (ERIN BROCKOVITCH, TRAFFIC,etc.) ones. This time, Mr. Soderbergh's creativity seems to have been subordinate to the company he kept during its making. The filmakers seem so determined to make the viewer prostrate before their consideration of \"serious issues\", the film becomes pervaded by a smugness that renders the material as leaden, inert and lifeless as a small moon.\n\nAnswer:",

Not knowing what an adequate time limit was, it is hard to determine how much this book will help me for the actual LSAT.Also, it should be noted that I found at least three mistakes in this book, so be forewarned that these mistakes ruined two questions and one entire Logic Game.\n\nAnswer:",

This one is more of a meditation and relaxation video than a workout video. Most people say the segments are each 20 minutes long, but that's only if you do all of the meditation. The workouts are actually 13 minutes for the AM and 18 minutes for the PM. The other video I purchased has so much more to offer with more than one routine and much more length. If you don't want to spend a lot of time working out, press stop when you're ready. This video is over before you know it. In addition, the PM section wakes you up more than the AM, so I'd reverse the order when using. Definitely go for a Bryan Kest video.\n\nAnswer:",

Grizzly Adams is a fun series that reflects the tenor of its time. The 1960s and 1970s brought growing concerns about the environment and those concerns were often mirrored in popular culture. This hokey series was a reflection of that time. Unfortunately, CBS completely botched this DVD release. The quality is terrible. The episodes are usually washed out, with miserable sound mixes and hundreds of imperfections of every type moving across the image. I will not be buying season two because I do not wish to support this kind of lazy release. CBS should be ashamed. . .after so long fans of this program deserve some basic level of effort.

Beautifully told, through the varying viewpoints of the main characters. The libertine artist, the blind daughter of the weaver,the servant girl,and the nobleman's daughter,all are woven into a tapestry.Chevalier definitely knows how to research. She brings to life the art of weaving tapestries, the woad dyer,(and his smell of sheep's urine,) with color and vitality. We see the importance of the Guilds, and the Church in the daily lives of the people. Arranged marriages, and a stay in a convent all help to support the way it really was. Chevalier brings the characters to life, and adds the sights, smells, sounds, and feelings of the period.It will almost make you believe in the healing powers of the Unicorn. Great read.\n\nAnswer:",

However, like so many other \"Ernest Jones\" instructors, including Jim Flick, Mr. De La Torre doesn't fully understand Jones' teachings and the importance of feeling the clubhead with your hands. As Jones stated in his book, Swing The Clubhead, \"Your hands are everything in this business of playing good golf easily.\" Mr. De La Torre cannot be teaching students to swing the clubhead with \"the arms on the downswing,\" and, at the same time, claiming to be a disciple of Jones, who I am sure is turning over in his grave! This thought only adds complexity to learning the correct swing. Any golfer, who really wants to learn the simplified method of Ernest Jones, should track down PGA teaching professional, Arnie Frankel, in Hobe Sound, Fl.

But even at it's best, the colors are blah and nothing is really in focus. Did they makes this from a VHS transfer or just use lower quality cameras?It's standard DVD format so I was not expecting blu-ray sharpness and color definition. But usually, standard definition video close-ups are sharp even when the audience and wide shots are fuzzy. The video is consistent regardless of scene. I'm guessing they shot this video with 1.33:1 aspect ratio (full screen) and then cropped it into a widescreen video. Maybe it looks OK on TV, but on a projector screen it reminds me of videos from the early 90's.In any case it's great to hear the music of Journey again.What a high energy performance!\n\nAnswer:",

First we bought one, thought it was really neat, and then bought three more.Every clock has quirks. One refused to set the right time zone--and we live in Fort Collins, CO, home of the atomic clock. Telling the clock to set the time for another zone and then changing back to Mountain Time solved that one. That clock worked fine for two and one-half years. Now it's four hours slow. The same trick didn't work a second time. Removing the battery and reinserting it made the clock set the right time--for a few hours. Then it was back to four hours slow.Two clocks spun their hands through twelve hours. One did this regularly at 4:00 for weeks but has stopped. After that escapade, the second hand is stuck. The other clock completely died.The fourth clock's second hand never worked but the clock does keep time.The clocks are great for amusement value but that isn't why you usually buy a clock.\n\nAnswer:",

When I finished it, I knew I would try others by him. How can you have a coming of age story when most of the main characters are in their 30s? Yet that is what you have.Coming of age, a transformation, a maturing; yes that was it. The characters start out somewhat two-dimensionally but morph into fully fleshed out characters. There are some aspects of the plot, foreshadowing, that are predictable. But even in those moments they aren't entirely predictable containing one or more twists that you couldn't have anticipated.I had to know what would happen. Two thirds of the way through the book, there seemed no good ending. Yet the ending was perfect in its quasi-ambivalence. I enjoyed the interplay of generations. And there were true epiphanal moments, often achieved by looking through the eyes of someone else. How often do we miss those moments ourselves?I strongly recommend this book.\n\nAnswer:",

If I accidentally cut those vines, I'll be in big trouble, and so when trimming around those long babied vines I use the Fiskars grass shears.The shears cut well through grass though thick woody stems can stop them in their tracks. The up and down handle mechanism is comfortable and doesn't cramp my hands like some of the side to side units. I like using these when trimming around the Virginia creepers and any prized flowers that I don't want to harm.After three years the shears still cut well, and though I only use them a few times a year, they're a great tool to have in the garden shed when the need arises. I've noticed that my pair doesn't close all the way when put in the locked position. That has never been a problem.Would I but these black and orange (Oriole colors) shears again? Most definitely.\n\nAnswer:",

Though many stars can cross over from the sound that made their name, Rod isn't one of them. And this album of pop and jazz standards just comes off as an oddity, more curious than good.He should be singing \"Downtown Train\" or \"Infatuation,\" not songs better suited to Harry Connick, Jr. or Frank Sinatra. I know that, since his surgery, his voice isn't quite as capable of the power it used to contain, but these songs are hard to do well - and Rod's efforts, though noble, do neither he nor the music on this album the justice they deserve.There are some high points, but he's not able to sustain long notes on most of the songs, which harms the tempo as well as the tone.\n\nAnswer:",

The story is fascinating, and, if one needs a brief look at the (mainly) military side of events early in the war, this book can be useful. Beginning about mid-way through 1775, the story works through its title year and early 1777, providing a clear picture of the difficulties Washington and his Continental soldiers experienced. However, most of the research comes from published sources, with a couple of notable exceptions, and some battles, for example, White Plains, are glossed over so quickly one best not blink. There is nothing new here, but, for someone beginning a study of the Revolution, this might be a nice place to learn some basics.

I really like both of the actors in this movie. And to describe some of the scenes to my friends, you would think it was a hilarious movie. So I'm pretty sure the writing was good, but the execution was off. The timing and the passion never seemed to click. Maybe having Downey Jr. as the straight guy was the problem. He seemed more mean that funny. Mean can be funny if given proper attention - Dr. Evil is quite funny, but he was vulnerable too. Downey's vulnerable side seemed fake so you never really cared about the character. Comedy is surely one of the hardest forms of acting to capture on film - you really have to commit to the character and the scene. This movie and the actors never really did that. There were a few funny moments, but in all it was a rather dull ride. What a shame. I really wanted to like this movie. Two popular actors cashing a check. That's all.\n\nAnswer:",

After about 3 months we started to have some issues with the monitor. First the on/off/volume wheel broke off and fell back inside of the unit. The monitor still worked, but was stuck on. So we just left it on and continued to charge it as necessary. After about two weeks the mic quit working on the camera. So, that was that, and we knew we needed to deal with the dreaded customer service department.I called Summer Infant, and though the wait time was long (about ten minutes) they are sending out a replacement unit no questions asked. They are renewing the 1 year warranty, in case we have any issues with the next one. So overall, I am still happy with our purchase. When making this purchase we were hoping to have this for any future babies we have. It looks like that is still the expectation!\n\nAnswer:",

This commercial dud doesn't match the grandiose bombastic genius of the band's debut, and bears no resemblence to the pop-funk of their 80's efforts.

The hiking guide is organized by trailheads, but the overview maps that are given do not cover a large enough area to plan a 4 or 5 day trip, which is the main reason I bought this book. I find myself flipping from section to section trying to piece together the trails in my mind. I've bought many other Falcon guides, and have been happy with all the rest. Since I know of no Wind River alternative guidebook, I bet you'll probably still buy this; I would, it does have some good info. But, I recomend buying a Wind River map while your at it, or use some sort of computerized map (google earth).\n\nAnswer:",

Although the story suffers under the bulk of espionage genre clich\u00e9s, like for example \"no good suspense novel without a good romance\", the basic idea is refreshingly original.The story is told from the perspective of the German soldiers and this is a quite daring and enthralling viewpoint. In the end you are so in touch with the story and its characters that you start to hope that the Germans will succeed in their crazy mission.The pace of the narrative is quite slow for the first hundred pages, but this gives the reader the opportunity to get really involved into the lives of the main characters. This part can easily be compared with the depth reached in a John Le Carre novel. When the climax comes nearer the pace suddenly changes quite dramatically. And believe me: once the show started, you cannot put this book down. Oh no!\n\nAnswer:",

First off Olevia doesn't make any of the parts on their own (my particular tv was made with LG-Phillips components i know they also use many sharp components as well as some other companies) The only iteam that Olevia does make is the TV case. so when it comes to any replacement (in warranty or not) Olevia is completely worthless.I would suggest to anyone considering buying a Olevia TV is that you just dont. Spend the extra money on a name that will stand behind their product, and one that will have a fair chance of repair if anything should happen in the future. I have spent a year trying to track down a replacement part for my 237V and in that time have failed to find any (Including contacting LG-Phillips).\n\nAnswer:",

The band is trying a new direction and it works, just not as well as their old stuff. Dave's lyrics are not quite as mood stirring as usual either. Basically, this is much more of a studio and mass audience album than previous ones.

The film leaves you numb, because you can't really connect with the charachters. And since you cannot connect with them, you don't care about how their lives are going.The acting is pretty solid, it's not their fault, I'm sure it's just the material. Just another book that doesn't live up to its expectations on the big screen. It's nice to see the depths of Spacey, as his portrayal of the bumbling Quoyle is believable.\n\nAnswer:",

It is really worth reading and would provide a great comfort to the loved ones of those who don't choose Christ before the Rapture of the Church. In the days when the Bible itself may be banned, this book would provide at the least, an overview of the events the Bible tells will happen to those left behind. The reason I didn't give it a five is because I would have liked more information, but the writer told me that the size of the book was intentional because of the nature of a handbook. If purchased now and read along with the Bible, it should be a valuable book in the coming days and years.\n\nAnswer:",

After watching it I went back to the Season 1 DVD set version. The scenes 'added' and 'replaced' do not add anything to the story and in fact detract from it. In their enthusiasm to change a scene they even clipped Jack O'Neill's line towards end of the movie. They show Tealc slowly 'shaking his head' in disapproval - that was not in the original. I didn't find the video quality any better. I almost get the impression they did this to keep interest up in Stargate because of upcoming movies including Stargate Universe. I would recommend sticking to the Season 1 DVD set so you can have a better pilot and the start of the series.\n\nAnswer:",

The controls for the game are bad, and sometimes unresponsive. There are 3 modes. They are air ride(normal racing),top ride(the camera is above and you are looking down with a bird's eye view),and city trial(go around for a few minutes collecting power ups. Then have a random race or battle after the timer expires). One of them, city trial, has you running around around a virtual city collecting powerups that are pointless for a few minutes. Then you have a random battle against something or dodging something, somewhat like the ones in super monkey ball.This game may satisfy hardcore kirby fans, and younger children, but everyone else, I DO NOT reccomend this game.\n\nAnswer:",

I was pleasantly surprised by \"Circus\", however, though in all essence, it's a toned down Tarantino wannabe with a British accent. \"Circus\" tries to be the ever-popular hip gangster crime film that was popular a while back, but it falls short a bit. The problem seems to be with the incredibly complex storyline. There is a new twist in the plot nearly every scene, so much that it becomes anticipated after a while. The purpose of maintaining suspense through this technique is lost somewhere, and the \"unexpected\" surprise angles seem to be nothing short of a gimmick. Despite this, I found \"Circus\" to be somewhat enjoyable; it held my interest through its entirety. Keep an eye out for Eddie Izzard and John Hannah.\n\nAnswer:",

However, I can only recommend this cd with reservations. It sounds as if the mix here is poor--that the piano stands out too much and that Sir Thomas Allen is standing too far away from the mike. I hesitate to say this, but wonder if only one mike was used, positioned so as to give the piano too loud a sound. The quality or technical aspects of the recording may also have been amiss. My point is that I want to hear the vocal nuances of this talented singer, but cannot make them out. It is too bad that all of the elements are here for a very enjoyable record--excellent pianist, good arranagement, and expert singer--but that the quality of the recording itself diminishes the total effect greatly.\n\nAnswer:",

Often, I found myself at odds with some of his recommendations and his writing style just reeked of strained, quasi-urbane hipness and attitude. I don't want to be too critical of the book, I certainly have to admire Mr. Reza's ambition for covering so much ground in his travel guide, but I felt that whatever he suggested wasn't also recommended in some of the other cheaper, better travel guides that I had with me on my trip.\n\nAnswer:",

What I liked must about the book was that they talk about what they would have to do with out electricity.What Ireally didn't like about the book was it had no pictures. I like the books that have many pictures and extra information because it keeps me on the topic of the book.My favorite part of the book was when this girl was rescued by a boy ,but they don't even say their names.They were my favorite characters because it showed that they care about each other.The part that meant the most to me was when they said that they had no electricity.I really thought about that because I wonder what they do with out electricity. I would say that htis book ROCK! After reading this book my question is, what would happen if they had electricity?Would their lives Chaged? I really recommend this book.\n\nAnswer:",

The one thing that will keep Madonna from being able to achieve true respect and longevity, past the 20 yr. mark, is that unfortunately she is not blessed with a true singer's voice. She's so limited in her ability to 'measure up' with the true vocalists, it will only hurt her in the long run.

I ordered a shielded cable and the problem went away. If you do not need shielded cable in your application, then this may work fine, but I'm not sure how you would know in advance. Better to spend just a few dollars more and get the shielded cable instead.\n\nAnswer:",

In fact, this replaced a DSL modem in our home network.

The traditional garish colors are there bringing us into his world of horror. The deaths are violent and the movie gave Argento a reputation for being a misogynist. The music is jarring (soundtrack by Goblin).The plot centers around the magical forces threatening an American student Susie Banyon at a school of dance. Mystery piles upon mystery. Curious friends are murdered. In the end, it is up to Susie to challenge and destroy the evil overshadowing the tall, imposing school of dance.The directing is first rate. The plot leads nicely to the conclusion. And Jessica Harper does a wonderful job of not overacting and showing the pluck she will need to overcome the magic.\n\nAnswer:",

You will put \"The Coming Collapse of China\" down only to check Chang's facts.You may disagree with Chang and that will make him happy; At the very least, you will have been challenged and you will have learned. If you happen to disagree and to be right, Chang will be giddy with joy. Neither of these things is likely. China has a dark cloud over it and you will feel the storm.\n\nAnswer:",

There are many excellent tracks on this album, but none match the strength of their originals (though con-cept's \"breath of life\" and philtron's \"when I needed you\" do come close). As with most electronic acts, the vocals are rather amateurish, and since Erasure's music translates really well into techno, the music becomes the star rather than the singer(s). I was disappointed to see that the covers only go as recently as \"Always\" (ignoring the past 2 albums completely), 4 (of the 10) covers are from the same album (Chorus), and there were no covers from Wild! If you like covers (I do) and love Erasure (oh yeah!) then you should definitely buy this album.\n\nAnswer:",

My 3 1/2 year old liked the art, but was bored by the story and kept asking questions wanting to know MORE about what was going on. She was intrigued, but bored.It's not a TERRIBLE book, it's just a dull book. If you like this art style I highly recommend TINKA or MY BEST SWEET POTATO, which have become steady favorites in our home, and others whom we have given them to.\n\nAnswer:",

From the get-go, the President's daughter Cassie witnesses a terrifying act and is silenced by fear and stubborness. Dr. Jessica is assigned to help her, as she has helped others in the past, and soon her sister Melissa and mysterious Micheal are involved. In the middle, the plot takes a turn and the reader is shocked in the way the characterization is shifted. The story unravels at times, and sometimes there is so much going on with the surface that you do not really get into the heart and meat of the novel. But it is a fast read and very entertaining.

I am a medical student going into residency and use my PDA all the time to look up drugs and confirm patient care...The battery sticks out about 0.5 cm from the back of the PDA. No big deal. I remove the protector anyway to reduce volume and to not have to deal with cover in my hand. I was willing to put up with the bulky battery. I was looking forward to the extra battery life, but the product does not sit easily in the cradle (not an understatement). This is a problem in getting the device to sync and charge. I tried to charge the battery without the cradle and had no luck. The indicator light never comes on so you can not see if it is charging. Eventually the battery indicator on the PDA showed it was depolarizing. Something is wrong with at least the battery I purchased and I will be going back to the original one I have.\n\nAnswer:",

Gale the leader states that the whole population of 3 billion people will be travelling through timegates to temporarily settle in the present day. They then plan to build new timegates which will carry them back to the Miocene era so they will not upset the natural evolution of man. The rush is on to get everyone through as soon as possible because the threat of one of the aliens arriving through time would be catastrophic because of their fast breeding cycle. One creature gets through and the chase is on to destroy it before it breeds. Simak creates a believable situation in regard to how our politicians and religious leaders react to the invasion from the future.

Adding weight to allow deeper penetration of the ground takes more effort to raise and lower the machine.Making a change to \"fix\" the raising and lowering of the machine, could in this reviewers opinion make this possibly a 5 star rating.Regards.Dan\n\nAnswer:",

But even as someone who agrees with Rall's views, particularly in his regular work, including comics and articles, I still think this is an overblown comic book all prettied up for a hardcover book. There's just not enough meat here to justify the format.The characters are rather plain and have very little distinguishing characteristics. I think that's part of Rall's point -- people losing their individuality.

The hero pretends to fight imaginary vampires as part of a con game. As the story progresses we find out vampires are real, and the vampire slayer ends up fighting them to preserve those she cares about. Her partner is part-elf whose dog turns out to be bred to fight vampires. And ultimately our hero is also magical. The overall theme is that things are not what they appear to be and that our fantasies have a basis in reality.The authors do a fine job of crafting an interesting story. They are slightly weak on character development--I actually like the dog the best of all the characters. Good action read!\n\nAnswer:",

The seat is extra-wide to accommodate me, and I can even fold it up and put it in the trunk of the car. The BIG downside to this walker is that the overall height (the wheelbase to the seat) is NOT adjustable, only the handles. When I need to sit I must put on the breaks and then tiptoe up to shimmy onto the seat. Then, when I sit fully on the seat my both feet swing freely, I'm 5'5\" tall. Since this is extra-wide, I have found that it does not go through a few of the doors in my house. I would heartily recommend it to tall plus-size persons and you might want to check the opening measurement of your doors.\n\nAnswer:",

In fact, the story has been put on screen many times before. Guy finds out he is gay, has trouble in accepting that for himself and his surrounding, but in the end everything turns out the way it should. Pretty thin story. Maybe especially for a Dutch guy like me. But the acting and the storyline are believable. And the actors are nice people, what makes it easy to sympathise with them. So yes, it's a clich\u00e9. But a well done one.I also liked the music in the movie very much. The Shane Mack songs as well as most of the others. That helps too.This movie came without subtitles. And that's a dissapointment for those who can't hear very well and for those who don't understand english well enough. And that's a shame. It witholds the movie from being seen by many people across this planet. Also those, to whom this story isn't so much of a clich\u00e9, but a story they live themselves.\n\nAnswer:",

Hopefully this is an aberration, I enjoy Sherrilyn Kenyon's other work, it is innovative and compelling.FYI, this book is set in the 1990's, that's why there were references to Zarek, etc. that were resolved in previously published books. If you're going to do that in an established series it really should shed some light on the current mysteries.

The problem is that you might be well advised to buy the \"Reason to Believe\" set of 3 CDs (also re-mastered and contains quite a few more songs that I think are worthwhile) instead. I find Rod Stewart's old \"Mercury recordings\" to be my favorites by far, but I agree with the other reviewer's frustration over the question of how many ways can they package this material? I'm glad it's still available, but the bizarre record company marketing strategies make choosing a collection way too complicated.\n\nAnswer:",

There are some entertaining entries, but I think the author ran out of good material.The entries consist of stupid things people have done or said, as well as famous quotes about human stupidity, and the author's own thoughts on human stupidity. Most of the first three are ok, producing some real gems occasionally, but the author's own thoughts on stupidity are simply awful - they lack cleverness, insight, and sometimes even sense.The calendar is a great concept, but I can't recommend it.

We're playing mille bornes, Five Crowns, Uno, Loot, etc. We bought Pit at the same time as the other games. My 6 year old loves it the best as, like reviewers will tell, lots of yelling and trading cards. For the rest of us, including a 10 year old, the novelity wore off in a few days.Each game only takes a few minutes with 4 players. The object is to keep trading cards until you have a complete set of 9. It's not very hard to do and is mindless - just trade away the cards you don't need. The yelling and the bell does make it as fun as this game can be. But, for a longer, more involved game, with a hint of using your brain, there are far better choices than Pit. We'll still play it for laughs, but it certainly won't get the play time of the others we play.\n\nAnswer:",

The flat-screen monitor I have fights for space with the keyboard, but I usually take the kb into my lap anyway. It is very sturdy and goes together easily. My only problem with this item was the top shelf was misdrilled, so the last two screws couldn't go in. It works all right despite this. After 3 emails to VisionDecor, I finally got assurance that my replacement shelf is coming. Despite the shelf glitch, I give this item 5 stars because it works so well and is so sturdy.\n\nAnswer:",

I thought it would be a nice art book--good illustrations, etc., but the illustrations are very boring and the book is very tiny. It has good information, but it's not real interesting---it's like studying for a course in college with a dry book with no pictures. It came highly recommended to me, so maybe I'm under-rating it, but I just thought it would be a much nicer book. As I said, no reflection on seller---my problem because I read the reviews and bought the book. Just one of those things. I would not recommend it to my fellow art friends.

If you want a good dragonball z game get the 1 or 3. 3 is the best. There is no movie scenes. The platform is exactally like a board game only with pogo sticks with heads attached. They look more cartoonish than they need to. The fightings o.k, but not good enough to be a good dragonball z game.

There was no adventure like the second volume. I was disappointed at the way the story ended. Aerial sacrificed herself throughout the story. Despite the finality of this triolgy, the story line is wonderful. Everyone who loves adventure and fantasy stories should consider reading this trilogy. The ending leaves me longing for more.

As I sat in theater 3 at the Nandesucon I thought this was an early 90's mecha flick. Past the opening scene I was suprised to find that it was actualy about three women who wanted to get back to earth. The characters are your average anime women, a tomboy schoolgirl, a ditzy teacher, and a renegade mech pilot. I have never been impresed with Bandai. I first knew them as the importers of Power Rangers, somthing that dwindled my respect for the company. This DVD does not have the best visual quality, but is much better than the static of Eat Man 98', for those of you who own it. Personaly I like this DVD, it has action, humor, and busty women.

The new model is poorly designed and lasts only a few weeks before it collapses.I owned at least five of these filters over the years; they usually lasted at least one year, although they always tended to soon start leaking around the ring that screws to the faucet. The new system seemed improved at first,(it was easier to install) but after a few weeks the plastic ring that holds it could not sustain the normal flow of the water coming down, and became stripped, causing the whole unit to fall down. Customer service has been helpful, repeatedly sending me replacement rings, but they all last only a few weeks. Too bad, because the filter insert did a decent job of removing the chlorine taste from the water.\n\nAnswer:",

When the vacuum is completed, you remove the wide-mouth jar sealer. The jar lid stays in place because of the negative vacuum pressure created inside the jar.

While the album was better than 98%of other releases and deserved some of the praise, it is not the best album by Spiritualized. The thing with this album is that it accomplished bandleader Jason Pierce's melding of traditional soul and gospel with old school psych-pop. The results are decidedly mixed: the title track, \"I think I'm in Love,\" \"Stay with Me,\"Broken Heart,\" and \"Cool Waves\" are exactly what the whole album should sound like. However the rest of the album doesn't work to great affect. \"Cop Shoot Cop\" is too long and the other songs sort of meander as well.

Aside from her suggesting that you take a deep breath, there was little attention to the role of the breath in relation to the movement. I felt she was too relaxed/casual in her manner: assuming that the audience was actually using proper alignment with few cues regarding possible tricks to prevent common position errors. Savasana was very brief. I gave this DVD to my daughter who is a Certified Yoga Instructor.

The image is crystal clear, with great detail and minimal noise and grain (which in some cases is simply unavoidable while filming), and did I mention the detail! Absolutely amazing. And the hi-def audio included is quite impressive as well.The only thing that is (slightly) lacking are the assortment of bonus features. But as I purchased this product for the program itself, it is only a slight dip for me. And I can't imagine buying the U.S. Version so I could have the missing features, but be stuck with Oprah Winfrey narrating...who wants that? Definitely stick to the Richard Attenborough-narrated version!!!!Well worth your money.\n\nAnswer:",

As such, this family tale is not likely to be a big hit. Clooney's intelligence in his choice of films is obvious, and this one is a cut above most Hollywood fare. It's a film about dysfunctional people. The mom spends the entire thing in a coma, looking more and more corpse-like. Great acting there! The kids are better than usual.

There also appears to be some type of sticky fiber near the top which may or may not be the remains of a spiders web. I posted a photo here. The clump is hard to get a picture of. The moth \"floated\" to the top, possibly because ti is completely dried.Apparently, this how Marshalls Creek Spices decides to add protean to their spices. Personally, I would rather do without.Under no circumstances will I buy ANYTHING produced by Marshalls Creek Spices of Oceanside NY.Since it has been so long, I probably will not be able to return this.

But once you use it, you'll want to carry it around, making little cooing noises--think waist pack or holster pack. Nikon's non-VR 80-200 is legendary--this one is sharper yet, and the VR does indeed add 2 EV, for what would be an effective f/1.4 on a non-VR lens.

I was distracted by the foul-mouthed Allen character; made to feel uncomfortable. Which was the point I guess. The film opens with a vicious argument and a strange, repeated image that unsettles. If you were expecting something else, you have to adjust.I adjusted better the second time through and enjoyed it much more, hence this edited review. There are plenty of good jokes (like the out of focus actor, played surprisingly subtly by Robin Williams) and set pieces. The scene when Harry visits his sister is particularly funny - classic Woody Allen.On the whole, I felt the film was treading old ground perhaps a little more than usual. I don't think of it as one of my favourite Woody Allen films, but it does stand repeated viewing.\n\nAnswer:",

I expected much more depth from Wells' characters. Because it is told as a series of flashbacks, the reader is only given thin facades of each character. None of Wells' characters seemed to possess a soul. I think Wells' intended message was that even though Siddalee endured so much abuse as a child, she realized that her mother loved her, and did her very best. A message often hard-learned, but after reading 356 pages, I expected much more depth, breadth, and a greater understanding for my own life experience and journey.\n\nAnswer:",

The dubbed-in operatic baritone by an Italian actor playing a Frenchman with an Italian accent both when he speaks and when he sings (?) sounds ludicrous to the 21st-century ear, the dialogue is frequently laughable, and the bizarre directorial decision to film some scenes through color filters that just look nasty, combine to make this an exceptionally overrated piece of nostalgic cheese. Plenty of ham to go with it, too. Bleah. The only reason there's more than one star in my rating is that the film does very well in making its point against racism, a socially redeeming factor that was very much germaine in the late '50s. But that's no reason anyone should be subjected to this snoozer at this late date.\n\nAnswer:",

This case is built for the 1gen - opening for your earbuds is on the WRONG side on this case, it's a little bit too small (though will work), and the plastic covering isn't positioned quite right to be able to control your scrolling.

I've probably made about 150 cups. In the last 3 months it's started to show some serious problems. Perhaps they are fixable but I wish I didn't have to have it serviced and can't even find parts on-line. The crema stopped after about 50 cups. The more serious and recent problems are that the basket seems to be seriously clogged, despite lemon juice or vinegar cleaning treatments and maybe because or in addition to this, the seal around the basket leaks and the steam setting leaks, sending some seriously hot gasses through the grinds and diluting your just made cup of espresso if you haven't removed it. Needless to say, this also diminishes the steam pressure available for frothing. I'm starting to look for a new one.\n\nAnswer:",

This book was highly original in the power of magicians. It's not just like using magic to do everything and being in secret from non-magic people. the structure of it is cool because of the way it has two main charaxters and switches views. Since magicians don't actually use magic, (they summon demons and the stronger the demon, the harder he is to control so you need to be a strong magician to control strong demons) Bartimeaus is actually the one with all the power, not Nathaniel (the magician).

From amazing stories of battles and leaders such as \"Ender's Game\" and \"Ranks of Bronze\" to delightful looks at who the victors in war are and what they receive in \"The Battle\", mixed in with non-fiction reports on war, the military, and it's technology, this book covers a lot of ground.

Time to cease product of low-def DVD's and go Hi-Def only starting now.

Plans go awry when the kingpin offers $100 million to anyone who can free him.This was a fun and excellent take on the '70s TV series where a wily SWAT sergeant returns to assemble, train, and lead a group of five officers who have to escort a notorious international criminal. Director Clark Johnson who has worked as a director (\"NYPD Blue\")or actor (\"Homicide\") on a TV police drama doesn't go over the top and lets the movie remain faithful to original source. The cast here is great with Jackson as \"Hondo\" and Farrell as Street and Olivier Martinez brings a weasel-like charm to his character. Even Steve Forrest, who portrayed Hondo on the TV series has a small role here which is nice to see.\n\nAnswer:",

What I do not like about it (although I could not give it less than 5 stars) is the regular-size NumLock key (some Logitech boards have a smaller NumLock key, which allows your to avoid pressing it accidentally). Well, it is just a wish, actially. Also, I am not crazy about the placement of the Delete key: it is somewhat hard to reach. The second ''|\\'' key exists for no reason (I guess that the manufacturer did not want to make another irregular size ''Alt'' or ''Start'' key ) and it kind of interferes, sitting between the ''SpaceBar'' and the left ''Alt''. Yes, I type fast, I type ALOT. So, certain things do make difference for me. There are no perfect keyboards, but this one is certainly above-the-average in so many ways.\n\nAnswer:",

For me it seemed to work best when the tip of the wand was parallel with the outer edge of the breaker. When you do find the \"right\" breaker you'll get both the tone (not to be confused with the ever-present 60Hz buzz) and the top red light is illuminated. Sometimes it seems like I get a \"tie\" -- pick one, open it, if the tone doesn't stop, it's the other one. Even under the worst of conditions where you can't decide, it's still somewhat handy, since flipping breakers one a time until the tone stops still beats flipping a breaker and jogging to some other part of the house to see if you got the right one.\n\nAnswer:",

(Such harmonies are the same ones Brian Wilson grew up with; the ones that influenced his Beach Boys compositions) But Fagan's The Nightfly is like a wine cooler: thin and dated. It's okay as far is it goes (and that's not very far) but not satisfying for more sophisitcated tastes. If you must have beginner's jazz in your system, get Steely Dan's Aja instead.

I just found out about this group (three guys from Boston, MA who met @ Tufts University) this year, and already I cannot imagine life without them. Though Parachute is but their first album, and as all 1st's are its not their greatest, (it's kinda like losing your virginity, a 1st album that is, the other 2 are just highly evolved masterpieces) it's still a must to have. Don't tell anyone, but Guster has replaced the spot for me that once only Dave Matthews could fill. So, take this advice and buy this cd (or tape if you must, maybe both!), try to be the first of your friends to have it! Guster is something the whole family will enjoy so go ahead, spend the meager bit o' dough and enrich your life today w/ Guster :).\n\nAnswer:",

As another reviewer posted the weight of the cans (standard vegetable cans) causes it to sag. Furthermore, it is difficult to insert the cans between.

It's wide angle diffuser lives permanently inside the unit, sliding out and clicking into place with ease. The flash is very good close-up, very good outdoors against the light. Sony's sophisticated flash control helps get exposures spot-on. It has extra AF assist LED's for the R1 (best turned off for the V3). I knocked off a full star, though, because it does not rotate, and therefore can't be bounced off ceilings in portrait format. It comes with a superb pouch and an off-camera mounting bar.

If you want to just plug it in and do something else, it takes about 4 hours to do a full charge of two batteries. However, you can do a partial charge (which charges the batteries just slightly less than the full charge,) in about two hours, provided you don't mind checking on the charger and taking the battery out of slot 1 after 1 hour so the battery in slot 2 can begin its partial charge. All in all, buying a couple of travel charges would probably be a better value. To do a super fast charge with this unit you must stay with it during charging.\n\nAnswer:",

He is paralyzed by fear. He feels threatened by bad luck. Past experience has been a cruel taskmaster. Here is a weak man who stammers, is hesitant, weak, alchoholic and defeated.

First of all, it lacks the \"No Time for Sergeants\" song found on the old LP version. Next, the mix of the stories with the musical performances lacks a clear direction. Finally, the material is almost exactly duplicated on the AMERICAN ORIGINALS album. Capitol would be doing fans a favor by combining the two albums and including \"No Time for Sergeants\"--they would all fit on one disc, and savvy justaposition of tracks would make an entertaining hour.\n\nAnswer:",

It has apparently been edited substantially from its original Latin form, leaving out all the salacious bits for the prudent Western audience.It contains wondrous descriptions of the magical properties of stones, plants, and animals. Most of these descriptions are incomplete, or at least don't actually describe what their headings advertise. But most of the information was probably lost in translation or just plain edited out anyway, so just pretend that when something is missing or the text just doesn't make any sense that it is some arcane alchemical allegory.All in all, a fun read and a little history lesson from reading the commentary.\n\nAnswer:",

Dickens had a flair for telling ghost stories in a charming way. The acting is outstanding. There is no music or special effects to assist a weak plot or poor acting. The actors are terrific and the plot is terrific. Dickens sympathized with people in humble vocations and here the movie manages to cause one to feel for the signalman who is haunted by a specter. The specter portends two horrible events, and on the third occasion portends the death of the signalman himself. It wasn't out of morbid sentiment that Dickens made this his ending, but it serves his heartfelt sentiment for those kind souls who were born into misfortune, were caste into misfortune by evil personages, or, like here, who squandered it through some series of hapless bad choices. And here is the secret of Dicken's charming storytelling.\n\nAnswer:",

I hope the set, which I now know exists as a tourist attraction in Malta, (I may have to go there), won every award possible. If it did not, someone surely did miss the boat. Everyone connected with the movie should be extremely proud.\n\nAnswer:",

I went to see the movie, and like ALL Nicholas Sparks books....they run everything making it into a movie. The book is called \"A Walk to Remember\" for a reason. And the reason why is that Landon had to walk her home after he got in trouble because he didn't have a car and everyone walked back then. The relationship started on their walks.... I have had to disassociate myself from the wonderful books when I see the movie because I know that they are NOT going to be as good and this one really got off track like Nights in Rodante and Message in a Bottle where they added characters, and took out 1/2 the letters, and The Notebook where they changed the ending and have ruined any chances of \"The Wedding\" becoming a movie.\n\nAnswer:",

So the front stuck out just enough to where the front covers did not fit correctly. I had to force everything back together. Lastly, here is where it really lost points for me. I called Tripp customer service about the situation and they treated me with such indifference that they pretty much told me that that's your problem.

Not too long after a year, it had trouble reading some of the initial tracks of a cd, but with patience, it pulls through. It never leaves the house, and never gets dirty, so I couldn't blame it on misuse. It's a decent little radio for someone who is not an audiophile, and doesn't have complicated parts that can go bad, like an automated cd drawer. Really, it is a large awkward walkman cd player, with two speakers. I can't be too hard on it. Its price was fair, and it has totally served its purpose of providing our daughter with the ability of listening to her own cds in her room.\n\nAnswer:",

Overall the album is simpler and more of a straight ahead rocker, compared to AoB and CW. Musically it lies somewhere between AoB and Bruce's earlier work, \"Ball to Picasso.\" The album starts out fairly heavy and then becomes more varied and emotive towards the end. Bruce's singing is magnificent though, sounding much better than the last two Maiden albums and I enjoyed every song. The high points on the album are \"Kill Devil Hills\" and \"Tyranny of Souls.\" Highly recommended.\n\nAnswer:",

Therefore I returned it to Canon and received a refurbished replacement, which also jammed. I have now received a second replacement (also refurbished) but have limited its use mostly to large photo prints. Most text I print on a much less expensive printer with less expensive ink.

RCA gets points for supporting Divx, commercial skip and HDMI out.However, this model is missing features and has a couple bugs. My biggest gripe is that RCA removed the \"Split Title\" feature which is a useful way to perform basic edits and to free up disc space. Also, the title screen doesn't always display correctly when playing finalized discs in other DVD players. Lastly, it seems to prefer +RW discs as I constantly got errors trying to record to plain +R DVDs.I would suggest looking at LG's line of recorders, or last year's Sony GX315.\n\nAnswer:",

The singing, acting, and orchestra are very good. So is the opera (one of Massenet.s most popular). But the scenery and the shift of time to the 1950s make it seem silly. As for the scenery, the giant tree that is the theme in all four acts is fine for act 1 (the garden) and act II (the town square, but is rather silly as the wall of the sitting room in act III and is totally ridiculous in Act IV where Werther's death bed in his bedroom is under this tree. Changing the time to the 1950s makes the plot unbeleavable. Girls of the 1950s simply didn't refused the man they loved to marry the man their late mother had wanted them to marry.\n\nAnswer:",

The many ideas and systems described by Allen sound great but, in the end, do not generate a coherent system. Of the dozens I could cite, I give just two examples.1. On page 170 he admonishes the reader to not use a categorization of \"Hold and Review\". One paragraph later he says that anything that one would have put in \"Hold/Review\" should actually go in \"Read/Review\"....with no substantive differentiation.2. The book is replete with instances where Allen creates a proper noun such as \"Someday/Maybe\" and then overlays it with another word \"Incubate\"...which sounds an awful lot like \"Hold (incubate?) and Review\".While I did not attempt to do so, my overwhelming impression is that a systematic reconsideration of the system and a rewriting of the book in which every component fits in a coherent way with the next, could turn this into a useful system.\n\nAnswer:",

From the beginning paragraph to the end it is one of the most convoluted books I have ever read. This book really is \"A Savage Journey to the Heart of the American Dream.\" Thompson and his \"attourney\" do so many drugs in this book, you would think that they were madmen. However, on this strange trip it's is Thompson's madness that carries him through his dangerous adventures, it's almost like a catch 22. I would recommend this book to anyone that is mature enough for the contents. Thompson may be no \"Hemingway,\" but he has a knack of giving us a different perspective, as valid as it is skewed. Perhaps this is key, to understand and survive in a mixed up world one must be mixed up. Thompson's brilliant imagination (or perhaps reality) will propel you right through the book which is easy 1 or 2 day read. Have fun with it.\n\nAnswer:",

If you're a n00b, opengl will render all of your shapes and colors, but it can't create its own window to run in. The GLUT is one way to create an \"opengl window,\" but the GLUT is by all means the most basic and useless of the possible methods.

Michael Grant is an excellent historian but even excellent historians can produce nasty potboilers. This is one. FROM ROME TO BYZANTIUM basically consists of a series of quotes (many from other books by Michael Grant, a few from other standard histories of the period) with some linking passages to hold the thing together. I gave this two stars rather than one because for a reader new to the period the book at least encapsulates the basic facts and trends.

For those who have complained about the high price, I too put off this purchase due to cost. However (and I don't know if I can get away with stating this here), the recording is more widely available in Europe and you can acquire it via the web through European sellers whose prices are a good deal more reasonable. The service I used is a classical distributor out of Birmingham, England called Crotchet (the English term for a quarter-note); their service was impeccable and the price was approximately $43 U.S. Crotchet can be contacted through www.crotchet.co.uk.\n\nAnswer:",

Does not look orange, rather a nice brown color. As far as rubbing off it does a little bit after it dries but no more so than other self tanners. I would say its one of the better ones when it comes to this issue.Cons: It STINKS! Color didn't show up until 2 applications, ( put it on later shower that day, and the next day applied again). After the 2 nd application I would reapply like every three - four days.You must use the gloves. If it weren't for the smell I would rate five stars.\n\nAnswer:",

If you want a parenting book I suggest the DR. William Sears baby book. It will explain with documented cited sourced facts and information as to why \"baby wise\" parenting is wrong and harmful to your child. NO babies are the same and there is no \"way\" or \"schedule\" that a child is set to follow. Babies espeacily those that are breast feed want to suckle not only for substance but for comfort a feeling of closeness that they shared with you in the womb, why deny them of that? CIO that's a good way for your child to mistrust you. Crying is the way children communicate and for a parent not to respond to a childs cries demeans the child. How can a parent listen to thier little one cry, your little one simply wants to be with you, again why deny them of that. Please,Please read up on other methods for the benefit of your child.\n\nAnswer:",

My professor kindly reminded me that pretty pictures and examples can be found in undergraduate vibrations books. Also, the matlab code in the book is not available anywhere online or on disk.

He seems to have piqued our daughter's interest in learning to use the potty. Mercifully, his cup does not actually fill with liquid, and there is no \"end product\" to deal with. You may, however, feed Elmo from any cup, as he only requires that you push the switch in his mouth when he is thirsty. I enjoy that he doesn't become too dispondent when he has an accident (if you don't get him to the potty on time). He can play an important support rol in potty training.\n\nAnswer:",

I have always washed the dutch ovens by hand, with hot water and mild soap -- never in the dishwasher. The enamel, especially at the bottom, had became a tad browner every time I put it in the oven. I wondered if I could have the pale-cream surface back, and bought this.Sadly, I have had no success at all with this solution. I don't think that using this cleaner from the get-go would have been brilliant, because it made absolutely no difference to the stains. Maybe Le Creuset enamel gets colored from red wine tannins and they don't advertise it?\n\nAnswer:",

The unit comes with an adapter that has 2 RCA jacks to a \"female\" mini jack, this is useless unless you have a male to male cable (which I do). The other things to note are the green LED (S/PDIF) stays on all the time signal or not even though the manual states if there is no signal the light wil \"go on & off\" (if I recall another review mentioned this as well). Also the hardware offers no input level adjustment.

The first chapter is written so descriptively that it captures your imagination and he doesn't let to go until the very end.\n\nAnswer:",

I'm a very petite woman - so these work for me - but I also have long hair. So when you snap the front together and pull the glasses up over your nose, because the \"tether\" is so stiff - it fights with my hair. And the option to leave them on the outside of my long hair isn't an option. So these are a great idea, if the tether was a bit softer or more flexible and/or they adjusted much longer. It would be great for a man with a small head or face - as they don't really give you much lee-way. I opened them up to the largest adjustment possible so they fit me - but again - I am small. So this would not be something for a large woman or your average male.I do love the idea that they pull apart and then snap together - because when I left them open on my neck - and I was wearing a scarf, no one even knew they were there and they really can be convenient. So just some tweaking and these would be the dream reading glasses!\n\nAnswer:",

Can't do a second cup quickly...too hot to handle the filter to clean it out...and messy.I totally wasted $15 on this item. What a waste of money.Hint to mfgs....the Keurig system works with HIGH PRESSURE forcing water through the coffee grounds quickly producing a GREAT cup of full bodied coffee...hence the slight foam on the top. This lid has no seal at the top....first time I used it I noticed it and wondered how it would work without a seal. It doesn't. My belief is that if a seal was put on the lid it would work fine. If you open a K-cup after use the coffee is smashed against the lid...but the sealed cup keeps the water and grounds from coming out the top. Bad design...good idea.\n\nAnswer:",

However, he was still unable to add any ounce of musicallity to even the most lyrical of melodies in the Quate. His tone also does not reach the level of brilliance that his former teacher, Eugene Rousseau, shows on the Heiden \"Fantasia Concertante\" on his own CD. I would recommend this CD only if you are a young student who wants to play the pieces with a metronome and along with the CD at the same time, as Fischer does not know the meaning of musical nuance. Maybe he will ask himself whether or not it is time to stop recording and focus on teaching. I will praise Fischer for one thing, This CD does not hurt my ears nearly as much as the first.

So far I have made the potato cakes (potato, watercress wraped in bacon). Absolutely marvelous with a grilled steak. The fingerling potatoes roasted with tomatoes, garlic and cream are sensational.

To add to this reader's exasperation with this mysteriously superficial biography, Randolph Scott's adopted son states at several points that Randolph's life was much more complex than the son is willing to reveal out of respect to Randolph's wife and friends. My guess is that Randolph's family still controls what is by all accounts a fabulous estate; thus both their own as well as Randolph's privacy interests will live on. If the family will not cooperate with an effort to substantiate and compile a definitive biography, there is virtually no chance that the son will ever be able to tell us more.Nonetheless, my curiousity was relieved and I am grateful for crumbs.Alexander Witkowski\n\nAnswer:",

Instead, the book acts as a good text for the surgical tech student who is still working on getting the basics under his belt. Instruments aren't really differentiated in the book so much as listed with pictures according to specialty. It's good as a general reference, but not for any detailed study.\n\nAnswer:",

Using it requires practice, you must get it going fast and turn it at sufficient rate to keep it going, but once you discover how it feels once it's going you'll be able to do it again.It's possible to use while driving, though requires some careful attention and a place to quickly put it, like a cupholder, if you need both hands (otherwise it will spin all around the car).The main downsides are that it makes noise while spinning, which might annoy your family and makes it unusable in many office/work environments, and it can be uncomfortable to hold with mainly your thumb and forefinger (Once it gets going I usually reposition it so I am using all of my fingers and palm to hold it from the bottom-- a slightly different grip around the edge would have helped with this).\n\nAnswer:",

It is the most magical, moving and haunting piece written for small orchestra and vocalists. The redemption scene at the end in which a madwoman's madness is absolved is of such beauty and power it leaves you breathless.However, this recording does not show the piece to it's full potential. The performances while vocally strong, have brash, harsh and annoying \"old men belting\" sounds. Even the wonderful Peter Pearce is not at his best here, where his performance of the madwoman is just too sane and slightly cold and nasal. Occasionally, the diction is unclear too (perhaps due to the nature of the piece), and the band/orchestra lacks flow, fluidity and sensitivity.However, I would still urge any enthusiast in 20th Century opera to buy this!\n\nAnswer:",

However, some of the poems seem contrived; some seem muddled in a \"sufified\" Christianity; some seem didactic. Unfortunately not one of the three descriptions mentioned above is particularly appealing to me.

The story, itself, is a nice idea. Finding a message about a man's undying love for his wife would get most women and their libidos racing to find \"man with love expressive language.\" You can ask most single women, and I guess married ones too, how often they hear a man express his love, passionately, to them or anyone else. The answer will probably not surprise you so, when a woman senses this in a man, even if he is expressing it for another woman, said woman will want it, at any cost. Sparks mixes his metaphors, and continued to ignore the verb-object agreement. For the most part, the book read like it was done by a first-time, romance novelist.\n\nAnswer:",

An exciting story with what looks like real tradecraft sprinkled throughout the book.If you liked Clancy's Without Remorse, I think you'll love this book. If you like Clancy, look up McNab, and then Dean Ing. Ing used to write SF (which is so good that many non SF'ers enjoy them) but now writes (damfino what to call them.

When I went to use it just 3 days later on my other car, it would not extract transmission fluid.The plastic fitting that connects to the top of the unit was sucking air, so it would not create a vacuum. I had to stuff a circular piece of paper napkin between the fitting and the opening to get it to seal and work somewhat.After the first use the unit was rinsed with a mild solvent and cleaned as per the instructions. The oil I extracted from the van was NOT synthetic (see someone else's review on that subject). I now need to find the correct size O-ring to replace the defective,leaky original.The fitting should be of the threaded type and not a press fit that becomes leaky in a short time!

I am sorry to say that I found it very slow and over written. The characters are shallow, the story line is far fetched and the nding is just downright unsatisfactory. And then, just when you think you've reached the end you discover 'Hisorical notes.' We are all aware that it is a story so why prolong our torture with 'Historical notes'? Its not real and the notes are irrelevant. Not only that, they pose the question of how Offred was able to record them. No-where in the novel does she relay any such detail as her difficulty in keeping records. And finally, my last moan, why are the notes at the end? They would provide a good basis and outline of the novel. They belong at the front. Though to be perfectly honest the whole thing belongs in the bin. Never agin should a student be subjected to such rubbish.\n\nAnswer:",

One big mess of unbelievable casting, acting and action - set in equally untrustworthy locations, with a non-existent storyline. Overall impression: \"The Pirates of Penzance\" meets \"Spiderman\" w/o the music.The weirdest thing is, that the film is barred of morality. As a consequence, it conveys no feelings to the spectator. There are no villains and no heroes - all characters are \"bad\" to some extent. The violence becomes senseless gore without empathy or sympathy, and the \"romantic moments\" are reduced to showing of bare flesh in paparazzi style. You're not involved in the action, but are prone to wonder how on earth 2 hours and 45 minutes can feel like an eternity.\n\nAnswer:",

Sadly Tom Clancy seems to have forgotten this and treats us to a 700 page preamble that had me wondering if I should sign up to save the rain forests. The paper used in the last third of the story was worthwhile and that's about the best I can say for it. Even so I often wonder how such works receive such tremendous critical acclaim - it is no different here in Britain or the rest of Europe. For anyone interested in how you write and produce a work far superior to this and in half the pages I urge you to read English techno-thriller writer John Templeton Smith's 'White Lie' - JTS is one of the most underrated of writers, but then we Brits haven't got a clue about marketing. In the meanwhile, may I respectfully suggest that you wait for Harrison Ford in the movie (I'm a big fan of the popcorn!)\n\nAnswer:",
