Why won't NHS help with the effects of weight loss\nQuestion: I lost a lot of weight (stones), as was advised to by NHS Doctor. However, now I am more unhappy, than when I was very obese. My breasts never came down in size from (42D) with the weight loss, and now hang with extra skin, down to my waist. I have to lift them up to get into a bra and bathe underneath them. They are very heavy and can be painful, and hang out of most bras. I sought NHS help but have been turned down twice. I feel very angry as it was through the NHS advice that I lost all the weight. Why won't the NHS help with the aftermath of gross weight loss? Excercise has not helped my breasts. I often feel like cutting off my own breasts. I'm 37 and desperate. I would even be a guinea pig for a trainee plastic surgeon to practice on. I'm not vein and not wanting surgery for cosmetic reasons, but because my breasts are ruining my life. I cannot afford private treatment, so that is not an option.\nAnswer: join porn\n\nAnswer:",

She plans on raising taxes, all taxes not simply overturning the Bush tax cuts. Which, by the way, included tax cuts that saved MiddleClass American families $2,000 a year.  Gone. She wants them repealed immediately. \\n\\nNancy Pelosi has a strong anti-military attitude. She has voted against every piece of legislation brought before the House to better equipt our men and women serving in Iraq and Afghanistan.\\n\\n\\nLegalized drugs\\n\\nUnfettered abortion rights (partial birth abortions)\\n\\nNo parental notification for minors seeking abortions. Not control over whether a minor can actually have an abortion, just notifying Mom and Dad whether their minor child is seeking an abortion.. \\n\\nRehab not punishment for dangerous criminals\\n\\nNo border restrictions. She has *invited* illegal aliens to come to San Fransico, they are \"welcome\".. \\n\\nAnti-christian values.\\n\\nPS... Well Map, it is a referendum on Pelosi. If the Democrats win the majority of the House from the Republicans today she will be the Speaker of the House and third in line to be President if something should happen to Bush and Cheney. The type of woman she is DOES MATTER. \\n\\nIf you want a person like Pelosi to be Commander and Chief of our military then by all means ignore how she would rape the military budget. If you believe that criminals can be rehabilitated and should not be punished, ignore the facts. If you believe that an organization like NAMBLA should be supported by a potential President of the United States, ignore that too. Wake up Map...\n\nAnswer:",

Greenish discharge is often associated with infection by Trichomonas [a microscopic, parasitic protozoan], Gonorrhea [a round bacteria \"Neisseria ghonorrheae\"], or Chlamydia [also a bacterium, \"Chlamydia trachomatis\"]. Infection with any of these organism should be promptly treated [all are readily curable by means of oral and/or injectable antibiotics]. Delay in diagnosis and treatment may result in chronic infection, Pelvic Inflammatory Disease, and scarring of your internal pelvic organs leading to infertility. Go to your gynecologist or a clinic ASAP to be examined, diagnosed and properly treated. Remember, your current partner[s] must also be treated at the same time as you to prevent reinfection.\n\nAnswer:",

So, I don't feel as bad.\\n\\nHow about you...best investment & worst.  \\n\\nDon't include homes.  But you can stocks if you want to.\nAnswer: Best Investment(s): Aquarius Platinum (AQP.L) - bought \u00a35 worth last July via Halifax SHAREBUILDER (franchised from sharebuilder.com for the UK market)..... got as high as about 114% in profit before crashing back down to about 79% in profit.\\nWOLFSON Microelectronics (WLF.L) - makes things like the sound chips used in the SONY PSP, XBOX360 + Video iPod. Stuck a tenner on them at the end of November '05. Currently +56.82% in profit, but that's only after they took a couple of big drops on Friday & Monday (28.00 on Monday).\\n\\nWorst Investment: Goshawk Insurance Holdings (GOS.L) - bought earlier this year as a bit of a dabble in \"bottom fishing\", appears they have de-listed. Bought 67.253522 in them for \u00a35 (sharebuilder again)\\n\\nTinsley (Eliza) - TNL.L  Shares suspended since end of january due to company being put in administration (so much for making a huge profit on their low valued shares: 20.95123 for \u00a35.\\n\\nD1 Oils (DOO.L) - one of my first investments early last year. The first I sold 'cos the value was going up & down like a prostitute's knickers on a good night. Was \u00a35.12 in profit at the time, but only got 12p back after the commission fee was deducted.\n\nAnswer:",

What can I do?\nQuestion: I met my girl about a year ago, we starting hanging out almost everyday calling each other talking forever even before we started going out. This happened for 6 months and finally I worked up the courage to ask her out. Weve been going out for about a month and a half now, officially, 2 unofficially. Weve had our shares of fights before where she claimed she didnt want to be with me, but she ended up with me the next day, and everything being fine again. But now, we had a fight 3 days ago, where some really harsh things came out of her saying I turned my back on her before and that im scum, a waste of her time, etc. Shes had a pretty harsh past where shes been cheated on, and has cheated on people, and most of her friends have turned their backs on her leaving her to deal with everything herself. During these times, i stuck by her, always taking her side we got so close because she said i was the only person she could trust, i was sincere and sweet.\nAnswer: I answered your previous question about this issue and really wanted to send you an e-mail this time but you dont have that option available.  All I can say is she sounds just like me when I was her age and I know exactly what she is going through.  If you ever set up an e-mail contact get back to me and I will try and explain her to you so you can have a better understanding of what is going on.  Most of what people are writing to you is not right.  I dont think anybody can understand it unless they have been through it themselves.  Good luck.\n\nAnswer:",

[[try 79 years old]] and he could possibly need a pacemaker. he's suffered from heart failure, and smoked about 50 years of his life. the way my mom described a pacemaker thing she said they have a procedure to put something on his heart to make it beat better. is this what it is? and could it possibly hurt my dad??? are there any dangers in a pacemaker??\\n\\ni'm really nervous and don't know what to think...\nAnswer: well let me assure you it wouldn't hurt him except the surgery. i am 22 and have had 2 pacer (my nickname for pacemaker) surgeies coming up on my third. and while i am very tired and hurting after the surgery, i live a normal life after the healing. now i am not saying you dad will be fine it sounds like he is kinda not healthy with the smoking and all but the pacer won't hurt the situation it'll help. he might be even better after the surgery, more active and stuff, better chance at living longer. the surgey (for most are outpatient which means you pretty much get to go home in the same day) goes like this there is a small disk about the thickness of a cd case slightly bigger maybe 1 and 1/2 cd cases. and round about the size of the top of a pop can. it has two leads (two covered wires) that came out of the disk. they have a small screw on the end of each lead which are screwed into the heart, no worries that doesn't hurt. once the leads are in place chances are they will be there forever they don't go bad and are detachable at the disk end for repacemant surgies. which depends on how much his heart uses it. i use mine 100% of the time and i get about six years out of mine. they put the disk in your shoulder (mines' on the left), or sometimes older ppl have a bag with the disk in it but i think that's for ppl even older. then if they put it in your shoulder they sew you up and leave a scar about two inches wide, and not even an inch thick. the pacer from day one will shock his heart into working kinda similar to the paddles in the er but not quite. it doesn't hurt and you don't even notice it most the time. the only time i feel mine is right before i go to sleep if i hold real still i can feel a slight bump  from the inside but it doesn't hurt i think it's kinda cool and i usually laugh just a little at the thought of what it just was. sometimes i forget i have a pacer and other then being wary of big magnets (which shut off pacers) and playing football (a hard knock to the pacer could possably dislodge the leads) i live a full and happy life. without it i couldn't be here. so your dad has a great chance of being just fine. just be there for him and don't bump his shoulder for at least awhile it does hurt, just like any stiches would. praying wouldn't hurt and don't worry the pacer won't hurt him.\n\nAnswer:",

When is it painful, shortly before of after your perioid, then just avoid sex during this time. If you are having any kind of pain in your vagina than you should see your ob/gyn.

Mike Shinoda Da MAN!.....lol!\nAnswer: It's a pretty good cd, not ground-breaking, but not bad either. My favorite track is \"Where'd you go?\", track 6 I think. I can't help but think of Linkin Park when I hear his voice because his rap style is exactly the same.

One day there may be the same debate about David Ortiz or Travis Hafner.\\n\\n3) IT'S STUPID! It's like the NBA creating a Designated Free Throw Shooter so guys like Shaq don't look bad anymore. Or the NBA having a Designated Defender/Offensive Player. One guy stays on one side of the court one on the other. Or how about the NFL has a Designated Run After Catch Guy. Joe Jurevicious catches it (Stop the game...Everyone hold places) Insert Peter Warrick, and resume play. \\n\\nTruly the dumbest rule in sports ever. \\n\\n4)Ruins the World series. National League teams are at a disadvantage in American League parks. They don't have a guy signed and paid just to hit.\\n\\nI like Inter-League I do. I like the wild card even though I think they should add another wild card. I think the two wild cards should play a 3 game set while the three division champions rest. There's no incentive to win the division. But the DH rule, I have always hated.\n\nAnswer:",

Oh it has to be FREE\nAnswer: Most web hosting services have their own site layout tools that you can use, but honestly the best program is already on your computer.  Either Notepad (windows) or TextEdit (mac).  If you do a search on \"how to\" and \"HTML\" you should find a lot of pages on the internet that teach you HTML.  It's better to know the basics and do hard coding before moving on to professional programs.  I know this because I had an ex gf that is better with web design than I am, but she always used Dreamweaver.  However, when she went for a web designer position, they asked her one question and she didn't know the code because she was used to the program doing all the work, when it would have benefited her to learn how to hard code first.\n\nAnswer:",

There's several pitchers of equal ability you can get for 6 or 7 million a year.  Weaver shouldn't be kept. When he's on he's good,  but he's too inconsistent and at this point in his career, if he hasn't reached the expectations placed upon him when he first came up he's never going to reach them. Fans might be sentimental towards Soup and Weaver because of their postseason performances, but those few games alone don't justify making a bad long-term decision.\\n\\nAs much as I cringe saying this (based on numerous 2006 nightmares he cause me to have), I would keep Marquis. He has great stuff, and could potentially be a very good number 2 starter. Hopefully last seasons' implosion was just a fluke and he'll get his act together next season. He's an all around great athlete, and has the potential to be a 16 to 18 game winner. I hang on to him and hope that he can get his act together, even if that means shipping him down to Memphis (Cards AAA affiliate for all the non-Cards fans reading this) for a few months.\n\nAnswer:",

These are multi-station devices, much more costly than RF detectors. They measure lightning strike data more precisely. Usually they require a skilled operator.\\n\\n\\nd. Atmospheric Field  Mill Monitors. These measure the potential gradient (voltage) changes of the earth's electric field and report changes as thresholds build to lightning breakdown values.  \\n\\ne. e. Optical Monitors.

The chief problem may be that you are keying on the earnings reporting date, not the quarter ending date.  \\n\\nThus, if a company reports great results for the quarter 1/06-3/06, but they report their earnings on 4/15/06, you want to see what happened to the stock beginning 4/15 going forward (and you may or may not be interested in the activity on 4/15 itself depending on whether they reported before the market opened, or after it closed).  To do this analysis precisely and automatically with some sort of screening software may not be possible because the earnings reporting dates vary.\\n\\nBest way I can think of to do this is go to \\n\\nwww.earnings.com\\n\\nNot all companies info will be given here, but for a whole lot of companies you can get the history of conference calls for a company, what they reported as earnings, and how this reported number compares to their guidance if they gave any.  Based on the time of day for the conference call you can also make a good guess as to whether the company reported earnings before the market opened or after the market closed.  From there you have to just look for companies that consistently beat quidance and had increasing earnings and check them out.\\n\\nAlso, though you are not asking for my advice, let me throw it in anyhow (you can ignore it if you want).  It sounds like you are trying to get a system for buying certain companies before earnings hoping for either a pop in price after earnings or a slow progression upwards until the next earnings date.  I think you may be onto something, but I doubt you will find an easy little system to follow.  Each company behaves differently (some always beat earnings, some usually hit earnings, some are erratic) but the companies behavior is well known by the people who track the stock and probably built into the price before earnings.  Thus, you are trying to estimate what actual earnings will be compared not to what past earings have been, nor compared to the companies own guidance but rather compared to the markets consensus of what the earnings should be and who knows what that number is.  Also, more important than the companies earnings might be their forward guidance and this may drive the price alot more than the actual earnings.\\n\\nTo give an example for that last sentence, supposed a company consistently beats earnings by varying amounts, and is growing at 20-30% per year.  They guide their earnings 10% above last years number, but since they always beat the market may decide they are just being cautious and based on how their industry has been chugging along the market prices the stock as if earnings will come in 30% above last year.  Earnings come in and are 20% above last year.  On the day they report earnings, the company shows 20% growth, and is still 10% above quidance but will nonetheless probably have a really bad day because the actual earnings are 10% below what the market was expecting.\\n\\nTo give another example suppose a company is growing 20%, is expected to earn 20% more than last year, hits the number perfectly, but then guides lower for next quarter.  Watch out below, the earnings in this case is meaningless.\\n\\nI guess what I'm saying is there are alot of details to consider and if you get it right 2/3rd of the time you may end up a millionaire in spite of having some really bad days.  Anyhow, www.earnings.com may be the place to look for this data, and best luck with your analysis.\n\nAnswer:",

Depending on where you live, lenders typically cannot charge more than 60% interest per annum.\\n\\nLaws against \"usury\" go back to biblical times and were adopted by states starting in the 18th century. The concept was simple: People in dire need of money will pay just about any interest rate to get it. So society moved to protect them from sleazy lenders who threaten to break legs.\\n\\nIn New York, for instance, it's a crime for an individual to charge more than 25% interest on a loan. But what's illegal for a loan shark in New York is perfectly legal for credit card issuers that put their operations in states that have no rate ceilings, such as South Dakota and Delaware. They can charge their customers everywhere whatever they wish, because what counts is the law of the state where their credit card operations are based.\n\nAnswer:",

People here of all races are hurting more (not that some mean to-it is just the results). People here of all races are affected-programs being cut-drain on system-some increase in crime-medical has triple 3x over. Some have lost their jobs, Min wage doesn't meet standards-some can barely pay their rent yet alone food medical utilities rent food transportation. It comes together with the issue of what is causing the most of it-rather intentionally or not!!!. There is your problem. Do we take from the one who had it and is losing more to give to another. Touchy issue, not race-survival. So give it up on the race issue-it doesn't hold water!\nAnswer: You are SO RIGHT!!!! It is NOT about race,color,religion,or ANY of these!!!! What it IS about is CRIMINALS sneaking into this country, BREAKING our laws,Living off WELFARE (I know people on HERE, say that's NOT true,but i KNOW FOR A FACT,that it IS true!!), they have their kids,then the TAXPAYERS get STUCK paying their MEDICAL BILLS!!! They play the old \"racist\" card when anyone protests their actions!! They DO take jobs Americans WILL do!!! Then they have the GALL to march in OUR streets and DEMAND \"rights\" (WHICH they are NOT entitled to!!) while carrying their CRAPPY MEXICAN flag!!!! Now THAT is WORTH FIGHTING over!!!!\n\nAnswer:",

I am not trying to be rude or anything, my best friend is mormon and I love and care about her and her family.  I was just wondering about this.  What do you think?  Thanks!\nAnswer: Honestly, thats the funniest thing i've ever heard of in my life.  I've been a mormon my entire life, and we have no \"secret passwords\" or \"handshakes\". I would know, i've been to the temple many times.  Granted, if i wasn't mormon, and I heard about some of the things we do, i would be confused.  The main things that go on in the temple are;\\n\\n1- Marriages and sealings. we believe that when a man and woman go through the temple to get married, they are sealed together for time and all eternity.  This is a big deal for us.  Thats why it's done in the sacred temple.  They do hold hands over an alter, but it's just like a couple holding hands while they are saying their vows.\\n\\n2- Baptisms for the dead.  This is actually really fun.  Me and my friends go about once a week. and it's not satanic, they did it in the bible.  we just are baptized in someone elses name, someone who didn't have the chance to recieve the gospel while they were on earth. This is also a big deal to us. it allows us to be together with out entire family forever.  \\n\\nI hope this helped, honestly we're not that weird, and our temples are absolutelly gorgeous. Maybe you should talk to your best friend, and see what she was to say.\n\nAnswer:",

And Who Invented It?\nQuestion: Id really like to know because I am a big time baseball fan.\nAnswer: The origins and evolution of the various bat-and-ball games are murky, and many believe that baseball is primarily an American invention. However, many believe that it originated as an adaptation of the game of rounders, and was also influenced by the rules of cricket. As far back as the 1870s, American newspapers were referring to baseball as \"The National Pastime\" or \"The National Game.\" An award-winning account of the origins of the game is David Block's Baseball Before We Knew It: A Search for the Roots of the Game (University of Nebraska Press, 2005). The publisher's description of the book notes that \"David Block looks into the early history of the game and of the 150-year-old debate about its beginnings. He tackles one stubborn misconception after another, debunking the enduring belief that baseball descended from the English game of rounders and revealing a surprising new explanation for the most notorious myth of all\u2014the Abner Doubleday\u2013Cooperstown story.\" In short, the debate on the game's origins may never be settled to everyone's satisfaction.\n\nAnswer:",

I nhave paid the $2390.00 for the class, have been going, have not had an infraction in 15 years. I had 2 dui's in one year , then one dropped off (7 year rule) and i got another one, counted as my second again. been to jail, prison, for bad decisions i've made. Off parole, and good job. Only thing i need is a restricted license. HELP\nAnswer: It depends on the state you live in. In some states, it is possible to hire an attorney and petition the court for an Occupational Driver's License. An occupational driver's license restricts the number of hours and routes that a person may drive until their regular license can be reinstated. I am not sure how it may work in your state.\n\nAnswer:",

I'm trying to learn all I can topside, so I read quite a bit. \\nI was never taught that the cylinder valve should be turned back 1/4 turn or a short way... in fact, in my confined water dives and the others that I've done since certification, I've never done that; I've just opened the valve.\\nMy b/f says you should turn the valve back a bit, I've read it should be turned back in a tips booklet published by Scuba Diving magazine, yet on the Scuba Diving website, it says that the valve, once opened, should be turned back a bit or NOT AT ALL.\\nWhat is the correct procedure?\\nThanks!\nAnswer: Open it fully (not hard) and back off 1/4 to 1/2 half turn. No more or you may cause turbulence in the 1 st stage (heat it doesn't need) and potentially causing condensation in there. Not a good thing for the reg and definitely bad news if you're diving a normal reg and even an environmental, in freezing conditions. It can also cause a possible a supply issue at depth, when you need it most. Leaving it fully open, could cause the valve to stick, making detaching the 1 st stage a vexing experience to say the least.\\n It is part of the course, you may have just missed it. I've seen Instructors whip through that part mumbling.\\n\\nEdit: I disagree with Don on the fully open part regarding overheads etc. So NOT true nor taught in any wreck course or technical diving course. You ARE taught to know your manifold without the need to think. If indeed you do start to turn it the wrong way, the little it has been shut is an immediate indicator. Also, when it's backed off just that little bit from open full, it has NO impact on supply or smoothness of flow to the 1st stage.\\n\\n Edit: Yup, ask your buddies, they'll agree. As for the fella that answered last...well I guess he's never seen one occur nor read even the OW manual from PADI ( I dug it out, it's in there.). It DOES happen. Just like that outdoor tap that you opened too far and need a wrench to close.\\n Due to the amount of dive related questions that are popping up, this evening during a social at the local pub, I asked a pal of mine that owns a 5 star Padi to join under his shop's name. A number of years ago, this man saved my life on a wreck dive, and he's about to become a PADI Director. That's about as high as you get in that particular org as well as standing in my book. I'm not an instructor ( I got bugged again to do the course tonight for free), hence my reluctance to put the word of \"god\" into some of my answers here. Mine is strictly advice and experience.\\n He can. Hopefully he'll join.\\n If you're curious, his shop's web site is www.coltcreekdiving.com\\n heck, I think there may be a pic or two of me in there too.\n\nAnswer:",

Go on a hunt with an animal that may be equally as smart as you, The chance you might not make it out alive. It would be such a rush.

Wouldn't it just be fun.\\n\\nWhose with me.\nAnswer: For the last century or more people who otherwise would've been food for some critter haven't been and have reproduced. \\nThe past few years, with bicycle helmets, seat belts, radical surgeries, and so on, many hundreds of millions more who would've simply died from their stupidity have lived and reproduced. They've made more insanely stupid and clueless  people.\\nWe now have record numbers of people too stupid to walk and breathe at the same time. In any other time and place, they'd be critter food.\\nHaving said this, I sometimes think... well... it sounds awful, but I sometimes wonder what the world would be like if people all had to have a certain IQ level or higher or they'd be critter food. \\nSo a hunt doesn't sound as weird as I thought initially.\\nI just have the guts to say so.\n\nAnswer:",

He seemed kind of overly nice and his overall mannerisms kind of gave me a gut feeling about him. He offered to pay for lunch for fixing his car. Thats when the problems started. I wanted to have a decent conversation about something normal like women or cars or sex. traditional guy talk. But somehow he steered every subject i started into the bible! I am not 6 years old i know about God, I didnt live under a rock. Can they not tell i am unconfortable being preached to in a cult like way? I seriously wanted to sacrifice him with chair but being put in this awkward situation i decided to lean in and tell him i am the anti-christ so he can shut the hell up about how sinful i am for having premarital sex with my girlfriend. Seriously, what makes them so righteous pushing their beliefs on people?\nAnswer: Born agains are the worst.They are usually ex whores,sluts alcoholics and drug abusers...The worst of the lot,but when the spirit of God hits,and you realize the healing effect of it,it makes you want to spread the miracle of what happened.Now,however,most do not know the difference between;witnessing,and being pushy and annoying.the Born again christian is the greatest tool of the devil.they will push you away from God quicker than satan himself.Most totally forget the book of Matthew,where it is very clear about Judging another.i usually just listen to them,then when they least expect it,I go into full attack mode of quoting book,chapter and verse,then they realize I already know God,better than them,and they leave me alone\n\nAnswer:",

He was on probation for just about 5 days. he has also been charged with sodomey 2 counts, And of course breaking probation.\nAnswer: Go to findlaw.com and research your states law for sexual assault. Chances are since he broke probation, he will have that time to actively serve too. It doesn't look good. Especially if they 'box-car' his sentences, meaning serving one before he can start another.\n\nAnswer:",

I downloaded the free software from the MBA.com website.  They have two full practice tests and I found these helpful.\\n\\n2.  I also bought a Kaplan book and a Princeton Review book.  I thought that the Kaplan book was much more helpful.  One *big* helpful hint that I found was to **NOT** write in the book - you can't write on the computer screen on the test, so don't get into bad habits.\\n\\n3.  ETS also offers \"The Official Guide for GMAT Review.\"  I didn't use it, but I heard that it is very helpful - the questions in the book come from old tests.\\n\\n4.  In general, spend a little time each day working on the test.  If English is your native language, I wouldn't spend that much time worrying about the essays.  I don't think those scores are really looked at unless English is a second language for you.\\n\\n5.  Try not to stress to much and keep one eye on the clock.  Good luck!\n\nAnswer:",

Why don't you tell them \"Hey! You guys are great, but what you're doing absolutely sucks\"! Get a grip on reality. War is not easy, nor is it predictable. Many unforeseen things happen. Let me ask you this - how many terrorist attacks have been perpetrated on US soil since we've been in Iraq? Wouldn't you rather be fighting these fleabags over there? And do you realize that our forces, all volunteers by the way, overwhelmingly support the mission that they are fighting? Stop giving comfort to our enemies, and show an undivided front and unwavering support for our people and the mission that they are fighting. If you are not happy with the war, keep your trap shut and cast your vote at election time. This irresponsible BS is what caused the failure of the Vietnamese War. It's a war, and Generals, not journalists and anti-war demonstrators, should be fighting it and deciding its outcome!\n\nAnswer:",

They could quite possibly be warts, and they are completely treatable and removable.  You would want to do that before having sex, because it would be extremely inconsiderate of you to share them with another person.  You will not die from them at any rate.  Go see the doctor.  He/she will evaluate them and decide on the best way to remove them.  Normally they are removed either with applications of liquid nitrogen to freeze them, or painting with a mild salicylic acid solution.  It may take several applications to completely remove them, but eventually they will go.\\n  You may not even actually have genital warts.  You might just have several flat moles, or raised skin areas.  You will not know for certain until you go see the doctor and have them evaluated.  There is no need to be embarassed about it, or ashamed.  Doctors see it fairly frequently, and treat it.  You wouldn't be the first, and you won't be the last.  As personal as it is to you, it isn't to them.   There is nothing you own that will shock a doctor.  I've been a nurse and paramedic for more than 20 years, and it's not even close the first time I've heard this story.   You won't die from embarassment, and there's no need to be embarassed.  Just make the appointment, and go see the doctor.  You will leave feeling much better and much relieved, I promise.\n\nAnswer:",

In many schools architecture is the most competitive major.  \\n\\nBe sure that you go to a school with a 5 year or 4+2 program.  You do not want to be \"pre-architecture.\"  That qualifies you for nothing.  I did a 5 year program at Ball State (good program) but many schools are switching to Masters instead of Bachelors, but honestly, most firms know someone with a 5 year B-Arch is as qualified (sometimes more) then someone with a Masters, so that should not be your guide.  \\n\\nI agree with the above schools.  But here is my advice on finding a good school.\\n\\n I'd stay away from \"big names.\"  You need to be taught by real professors in studio classes and not by grad assistants.  Where ever you go look for that.  Also look for a school that leaves the building open 24-7, closing an architecture building at 12 or 1 is a huge pain for students who have to bring drawings and stuff home to finish (all nighters are normal for architure students from year one.)  Look for a school that offers cross displinary minors worked into your cirriculum, so often architecture majors never get to take classes outside their major, pretty depressing.  Look for a school that offers classes on \"sustainable\" architecture.  \\n\\nThen get ready to work your butt off.... and have the time of your life...\n\nAnswer:",

A myth is any story where a person goes through a journey of discovery.  Where they \"find themselves\" in the mythical woods (the world of the unknown) and come out of it a new person (think Luke Skywalker, who grew up to become a full Jedi).  So, that's your example.  Of course it doesn't have to be that long, lol.\\n\\nJust make the Rose (a wonder that has magical properties of some kind) a reward for some boy or girl who travels the world, discovering the \"secrets\" that keeps their village from growing or moving forward.  While discovering the magical secrets beyond the village, he meets new people, perhaps his father (finding ones Father is a BIG deal in mythology (again, Star Wars) usually the father set out to finish the quest but was unable or got caught up on the wrong side.  Finishing the quest, doing away with the BAD GUY and saving the father is usually what its about.\\n\\nJoseph Campbell was the EXPERT on the mythology and what it meant.  He was a great great friend of George Lucas and Lucas wrote Star Wars based on Campbells mythology work.  Campbell has many, many mythology books written as well as DVD's filmed at Skywalker Ranch.  Their awesome to watch him speak of myths and how they were made originally thousands of years ago and today, and both are practically the same.\\n\\nGood luck!\n\nAnswer:",

It didn't just happen this year and has been a problem for a few years due to lack of investment on the playing side. We got rid of Big Eck when in retrospect what he did in taking virtually the same team to the last 16 of the Champions League was nothing short of a miracle.There are players wearing the shirt who are not good enough to do so and while Le Guen may have signed some of them but he was working within the budget given to him. He has underestimated the teams that make up the SPL ( like many others) but a new Manager will not turn things around in the short term. For starters they need 3 quality defenders and 1 quality midfielder and they are only going to find them in the Summer and then if the money is available. Murray has put a lot of time and money into Rangers so I have no quarrels with him but it is time to go as he has clearly lost his appetite and is not about to put them back into debt and affect the selling price. The best we can hope for is an improvement in results which make the club look like a viable purchase without large scale investment but the root problem will still remain.\n\nAnswer:",

Whatever licenses or loopholes the site claims to have in Russia (which I would take with multiple grains of salt... or shots of vodka?), they don't extend to a U.S. citizen who downloads the content inside the U.S. That's where the copying takes place, and that's where the parties have to have a license to make copies. If they don't (and they don't), then you could be in trouble if the files were found on your computer. One interesting extra-legal thing to consider is that it's harder for the RIAA to get the names of people who use AllofMP3 in order to prosecute them, but that may not be true forever. Hope that helps!\"\\n\\nPS\\nTo me, it does not seem very difficult to get the names of those that payed with a credit card...\n\nAnswer:",

Verbal contracts are difficult to defend in court, as the argument then becomes one of \"he said, she said\". The best you could hope for would be a resolution through mediation or by judge's order. You never know, you might wind up on the lucky side, but you need to consider the cost of legal action, and determine if it's worth the time, effort, and stress involved in chasing this person down.\n\nAnswer:",

It is the ratio of weight of water to the weight of cement used in the concrete mix. It has some important influences on the quality of concrete produced. Concrete with a low water-cement ratio may become strong and durable, but the mix would become very difficult to place. If water-cement ratio is increased then the concrete mix would be more workable (or loose). It is easier to place the concrete in this condition but too much water can cause pores to form in the microstructure, thereby reducing the durability. The water-cement ratio is a critical factor in the design of concrete mixes.\n\nAnswer:",

A detailed report could be extracted from the website mentioned below, http://www.space.com/spacewatch/mars_retrograde_030725.html\\n\\nSurprisingly, this phenominon is announced around 1400 years back by Muslims in their Holy Quran & Authentic Narration from Prophet Muhammad peace be upon him.\\n\\nSome references from the Holy Quran: \\n1) Chapter 02:Verse258:- \"Abraham said, Verily!Allah causes the sun to rise from east; then cause it to rise from the west\"\\n2) Chapter 06:Verse158:- \"The day (ie. Portents of the hour e.g., sun rising from the west)that some of the signs of your Lord (Allah) do come, no good will it do to a person to believe then, if he believed not before, nor earned good through his faith\"\\n\\nProof from Narrations of Prophet Muhammed (peace be upon him):- Abu Hurayrah(RA) narrated that the messenger of Allah (Pbuh) said, \u201cThe day of the hour will not come until the sun rises from the west, if it rises and Allah places His hand at night to forgive his morning sinners, and places in the morning to forgive his night sinners until the sun rises from the west\u201d (Sahih Muslim).\n\nAnswer:",

If all the girls are in the restroom with you, who's going to talk bad about you?\\n-For tampons. This might just be my friends and I, but when I'm with my girfriends, I know that I'm never without protection. We'll be in two adjacent stalls and I'll yell, \"Damnit! Throw me a tampon!\" And two seconds later, a little tube slides under the door. I don't think I could do that with a stranger.\\n-Because we've been doing it since we were potty-trained and don't know any better.\\n\\nJust my theories.

There is no actual proof of god he is a belief shared by a majority of people. Every person is different. Some experience miracles and others witness murders and rapes and it is those things that lead people to not believe that god does all good things. When you live in the United States and you hear this crap about we're the most powerful nation in the world and all that, well why cant we feed our own people. I see poor people on the street every day so how has god done them good. How has god done good for those children in Africa who are starving to death before they are 4 years old. Or what about those children who see their parents be killed by a terrorist attack and have to live with a foster family because the leaders of our country are trying to benefit themselves, how has god done them good. Its all a bunch of crap the president doesnt want to benefit this country hes trying to benefi himself and gain more power so he can get more money and continue to expose the United States, but thats another issue. For those people it seems God has done nothing for them. I grew up religious but as i mature and as i see how things unroll in life i question gods purpose. And for sweetie up there ^, you cant teach religion in public schools. Remember? thats how America is so great. Freedom of religion. we're all free to believe what we want and we're still trying to force this god bullcrap on everyone. People in todays society are all greedy they care about themselves and themselves only. Why does it matter to you if other peopel dont believe in god. It's all crap and god has done nothing for many people but i guess since ur all probably upper class white people u dont see the reality. Exactly why this country is hated across the world.

Whether is has any bad effects in our health?\nAnswer: too much of any one food can be bad.Potatoes are high in high glycemic carbohydrates.If you are eating mostly potatoes during the day and not getting enough protein,you are risking getting a blood sugar disorder.Try to restrict your intake to one meal a day 3 days a week.You need to rotate your foods to avoid getting imbalances in your body.Make sure you eat enough vegetables,fruit and protein.Too much carbohydrates such as potatoes in the diet is as bad as eating lots of sweets...it can cause diabetes,so you need to scale back.When you do eat potatoes,leave the skins on them,because that is where all the potassium and b-vitamins are...potatoes are also excellent sources of fiber,in case of any kind of muscular-skeletal problems such as arthritis,they are not reccomened.\n\nAnswer:",

This happens a lot to people who have an excess of Candida Albicans in the system (caused by eating too much refined sugar and white flour and not enough whole foods, fruits and vegetables), and can also happen from a buildup of bacteria locally. If you wear the same underwear for too long, or wear a wet bathing suit for longer than half a day, it can happen quite easily. Some women get minor Yeast infections every month right before their period, and the period usually resolves the infection. They're normal, you just have to make sure you see a doctor if you get them TOO regularly, because this could mean you have an auntoimmune disorder you're unaware of. Also, you want to go to a doctor the first time you think you have one so he or she can make sure it's not something else; a lot of Sexually Transmited Infections can mimic Yeast Infections, as can Vaginitis and Bacterial Infections. It's best to check with your doctor, but if you already have and are looking for a good anti-itch remedy, put some plain yogurt on the itchy areas and the 'good' pro-biotic bacteria in the yogurt will fight the 'bad' bacteria, helping to soothe the itch and reinforce the good bacteria.\n\nAnswer:",

Basic precautions would include making sure that the company you are giving your card details to are reputable and that the details are being transmitted over a secure connection - look for the little padlock at the bottom of your browser screen to indicate that it is.\\n\\nBest of all, check with your credit card provider the protection they give you against fraudulent use of your card. You should be surprised and reassured to know that you are completely covered, and if you are not it is time to switch your provider!\\n\\nSo in other words, with a little bit of common sense you can be very confident to shop online, despite the scare stories that you read.\n\nAnswer:",

FOR EXAMPLE THOUGH THE SEA IS BEAUTIFUL IT CAN CAUSE DANGERS TO MANKIND LIKE TSUNAMI.\nAnswer: Nature is beautiful, but you musn't forget how big the power of nature is. Ancient people already know how fearful the nature is that they think the nature themselves are gods (the god of sun, of moon, of river, etc).\\n\\nTwo point of view that I can give you to understand it:\\n1. Think how big they are. Big is beautiful, but it's dangerous too, no? Like you that can splat a bug in an instant.\\n2. Like a fire on a burning candle. They are beautiful, very useful in dark environment. Misuse them and you can burn down your house (or yourself, or your table, or your bed, etc).\n\nAnswer:",

Is this fair?\nQuestion: Aaron Harang for Chris Ray.  Is this fair? 5x5, 10 team.  I'm way loaded w/saves. with about a 25-30 save lead. Is this fair or veto material?  Harang looks good to me but I'm looking for an outside opinion.\nAnswer: Straight up - no way. But...if you are loaded with saves...Harang's not a bad starter, however, he's got two things going against him. \\n\\n1. Great American Ballpark is a hitter's park...the HR's fly out of there left and right so be prepared to deal with a high ERA at home. (He is 2-3 with a 6.00ERA at home vs. 6-2 with a 1.57 on the road).\\n2. This is the big one - the Reds are a first half club. As a fan, I watch them do this every year...Strong start in April and May...waver in June / July...fall apart by August...out of it completely by September. So...be prepared to cut Harang when the Reds bats go quiet and he is getting zero run support.\n\nAnswer:",

Everything seemed fine, except more and more I'm becoming less intrerested in sex. My fiance had been in Boot camp and training for the first 6 months of the year, so I didn't really notice a drastic decline of sexual drive. It's put a litle bit of strain on my relationship of 4 years, as we've always had a very nice sex life. I feel bad because my fiance thinks he's doing something wrong(which he's not), but intercourse is not appealing to me lately. Period. I'm considering going off the pill for a while, but I don't want to risk pregnancy(even with using condoms) because I heard you were even more likely to get pregnant soon after coming off it. Has anyone else experienced this side effect? Or do you at least have any suggestions to help me get into the mood?\nAnswer: That's actually a great question, and yes, I've been on the pill for about 3 years now, and at first I did have that problem. I was on ortho tricyclin, which I blame it on. Because it gradually decreases in strength each week, tricyclin pills tend to have adverse side effects n some people. Once I switched to Yasmin, I think it's called a monocyclin, it all got better. That specific pill gives you the same amount of hormone every day of the month. I've been less moody, and more interested, if you know what I mean. The bad part is that Yasmin does not yet have a generic brand so it is a bit more expensive, but I'd totally recomend it. My doctor switched around my prescription right when I said I was feeling moody. \\n\\nBut then again, I may be totally off.

Epidemiological studies estimate that that around 1% of the entire population likely meet criteria for bipolar. Yet, psychiatrist in particular seem to like to diagnose this disorder whenever they hear somebody has an elevated mood between bouts of depression or has signs of agitation during a depressive phase. These symptoms may be indicative of bipolar, but bipolar requires much more. As a psychologist at a major medical institution, I can tell you that in the past 5 years I've only seen maybe ten true cases of bipolar, but I've probably seen over 100 patients who were incorrectly diagnosed with this disorder. If you think you have bipolar or a psychiatrist diagnosed you with it, you should get a second opinion from a doctoral level psychologist (i.e., Ph.D. or Psy.D.). The other way bipolar tends to be over used is if somebody you know seems unreliable or overly emotional. Such symptoms do not necessarily indicate bipolar, but the media and untrained physicians will use this phrase almost as a colloquialism.\n\nAnswer:",

Kelly ET AL.supreme court case. \\nArgued October 13, 1969\\nDecided March 23, 1970\\n I am a student studying law and my assignment is to tell what happened in this case and why. please help.\nAnswer: It was basically about due process.\\n\\nSomeone was receiving welfare, but then the state decided that he was no longer eligible and told him that the payments would stop.  He said, wait a minute, if you let me explain the circumstances, you'd see that I'm still eligible (it is called a \"hearing\" when someone is allowed to come in and tell their side of the story).  The state said, fine, you can come tell us about the situation (we'll give you a \"hearing\"), but first we are going to terminate the payments.  If, after hearing your side of the story, we think you are still eligible, then we will start making the payments again. SO THE STATE OFFERED HIM A POST-TERMINATION HEARING.\\n\\nThe guy thought that he should get a PRE-TERMINATION hearing, and that the welfare payments shouldn't be stopped BEFORE he was able to explain his side of the story.  So he sued the state.\\n\\nThe state argued that it would be too expensive and time consuming to give all welfare recipients a pre-termination hearing.\\n\\nThe case went all the way to the Supreme Court.  The Supreme Court decided that it was unfair to terminate the payments without first hearing the guy's explanation of why he was still eligible.  The court said WELFARE RECIPIENTS MUST BE ALLOWED A PRE-TERMINATION \"HEARING\" BEFORE THEIR PAYMENTS ARE CUT OFF.\\n\\nWhy?  In the words of the court: \"The interest of the eligible recipient in the uninterrupted receipt of public assistance, which provides him with essential food, clothing, housing, and medical care, coupled with the State's interest that his payments not be erroneously terminated, clearly outweighs the State's competing concern to prevent any increase in its fiscal and administrative burdens.\"\\n\\nWhat \"vocab\" don't you understand?\n\nAnswer:",

It occurs mainly, but not exclusively, in children. It is a common type of allergy, and is usually treated with an exclusion diet.\\n\\nSigns and symptoms\\n\\nPatients present with skin symptoms, throat tightness, shortness of breath, lightheadedness and/or stomach symptoms. The symptoms usually develop within half an hour of ingesting the allergen.\\n\\nRarely, food allergy can lead to anaphylactic shock: hypotension (low blood pressure) and loss of consciousness. This is a medical emergency. Allergens commonly associated with this type of reaction are peanuts, nuts, milk, egg and seafoods. Latex products can induce similar reactions.\\n\\nFood allergy is thought to develop more easily in patients with the atopic syndrome, a very common combination of diseases: allergic rhinitis and conjunctivitis, eczema and asthma. The syndrome has a strong inherited component; a family history of these diseases can be indicative of the atopic syndrome.\n\nAnswer:",

Being one of those black folks myself I can say without hesitation that the use of the N-word is most certaintly NOT 'okay', regardless of who says it.  Just because a small sect of blacks continue to use the word, and are sensationalized by the media, does not mean that the entire race embraces it.  It is unfortunate that you're still making judgements and assumptions using such gross generalizations, but I can't blame you, per se, as it does appear that the use of that word is tolerated by blacks when you hear rap music or watch certain movies.\n\nAnswer:",

And unlike other of these charges it has only one type (maybe predominantly) - positive mass. For that reason, there is no chance for masses to cancel each other out like when you have a positive charge and a negative charge and together the objest (an atom, for instance) is neutral electrically\\nI'm not sure about the weak charge though. Weak forces have a limited range because the bosons that carry them are heavy and can't go far, because of uncertainty (I'm not going into this deeper)\\nBottom line: gravity works long range because all masses add up and not cancel each other out.\n\nAnswer:",

I will not name the country but they got scammed with hematite jewellery...I brought them to a dollar store selling the same stuff !\\n\\nMe : I fell for turquoise jewellery a lot for a while until a friend who knew better pointed out that they were all fakes...\\n\\nI'm sure I've fallen for a lot....but can't think of them just right now..\nAnswer: My freshman year at college I ran into a woman collecting surveys and I filled one out.  They called me back and said they might be interested in hiring me if I wanted to come in for an interview.  The interview was actually a huge group screening process, so to speak, where we learned things about the company and got the opportunity to (theoretically) ask questions.  It was supposedly a type of sales company and I would have been a saleswoman.  I was promised to make a lot of money if I only worked really hard, and they gave us samples of some of the products they offered (health, fitness, weight loss and beauty products) and I, being gullible as I was, said I'd love to work for them (I was desperate for a job).  The woman I talked to told me there was an orientation in Grand Rapids and it would cost $25 to go, so I paid up and went.  Then I signed up for $250 worth of starter products, with a payment plan to pay them back if I couldn't sell them all.  I quickly discovered that it was a pyramid scheme, and that they didn't make money by selling products so much as recruiting other people and making money off of them, precisely as the woman was doing with me.  My mom chewed me out for it and made me give everything back, with the exception of a bottle I had already opened to give samples (they suggested that I use the starter set of products to offer samples and sell from there), which was sixty bucks.  So I had to pay that.  All said and done, I was out a lot of time and money and had nothing to show for it but a bottle of pills.  Yeah, I felt stupid...\n\nAnswer:",

So a dark Cuban, Peurto Rican, Dominican, etc would have been considered black so they would have experience the same discrimination that blacks had to deal with. However, if you talk about a real light Cuban, Spaniard, Argetine, Puerto Rican, they would have  been considered white, i.e. if they chose to obstain from speaking Spanish,etc and assimilating into the mainstream. \\n So, only the really light Latinos would experience less racism then their darker compatriots.\\n  In the 1940s, Puerto Ricans fought in integrated units during the Second World War, compared to blacks and  Asians which fought in segregated units.\n\nAnswer:",

The sheep, as the Bible calls them, will go to Heaven for all of eternity after physical death. The goats, as the Bible calls them, will go to the lake of fire, and burn in Hell for all of eternity.

Then I load it up with kneeds foot oil.  Any suggestions with this method?\nAnswer: With a good glove, soaking in water is great..then dry.  The only problem with Neatsfoot oil is that it drys the leather eventually.  Go to a Tack Store or Pet Supplies and find something called Bag Balm.  It is a salve and used on cattle...so it works well on cowhide :).  I have a 40 year old Wilson A-2000 that is still soft and supple and I used Bag Balm to lubricate the entire glove once a year and the pocket after each game or practice.  After it dries and you oil it.  Beat the pocket with the fat end of a baseball bat to soften the pocket even more....and playing catch with it is always good.\n\nAnswer:",

In the United States, there's a bit of a taboo on sex--it's not something you talk about so much. People have a lot of sex, however, because a large chunk of the population goes to college, and a lot of people who go to college have a lot of sex. It's not everyone.\\n\\nThis stereotype isn't helped by all the stupid people here on answers asking about sex.\n\nAnswer:",

The sims game takes up time and the drive to our vacation spot took 10 hours 2 years ago. This time i wan tot be prepared. so what should i do ?\nAnswer: laptops are usually not meant to play games (in general they have weaker graphics card, so you have to look carefully because they are not easily upgradable like desktops), so that may be why you are experiencing slow downs. Older games will work better on the laptop, unless you know that the graphics card is strong enough.\\n\\nAlso with a laptop, a too graphically intense game will drain your batteries out really fast in conjunction with overheating your computer. So pick your game wisely and enjoy your trip.\n\nAnswer:",

I'm goin to join volleyball next skool year and I dont even know how to play!\nAnswer: First off, if you are joining at the entry level, they will teach you all the basic rules and skills that you need.  But to be a bit more specific, volleyball is a team game which can be played with 2 to 6 members on the court.  A ball is served from behind the service line (the back line of the rectangle on the floor) and the other team receives the ball.  They have three hits to get the ball back to the other side, where that team will have three hits to get the ball back over.   The goal is to hit the ball to the other side, inside the boundaries, and have it hit the floor. This is how you score a point.  \\n\\nThere are many techniques and hits that you will learn.  It's a lot of fun and good exercise!  Have fun and enjoy!\n\nAnswer:",

The patient will be asked to undress from the waist down (pants and panties), and be given a gown.  She will be asked to empty her bladder in the bathroom.  Usually, a preliminary x-ray image will be taken.  The only way to see the bladder and uterers (the tubes that connect the bladder to the kidney) with x-ray is to introduce a contrast or dye.  In order to do that, the patient must be catheterized.  The radiologic technologist or possibly a nurse will do this part of the study.  Your daughter will be laying on her back, with her knees bent and spread apart.  The tech/nurse will clean the outside of the genitilia with a betadine soap and insert a small tube through the urethra to the bladder.  This can be very uncomfortable as the tube is passed through the urethra, but once the tube is in place, your daughter will not know it is there.  It is important that she try to relax her muscles as the tube is introduced.  Tight muscles will make the insertion harder and it will take longer, meaning it will prolong the uncomfortable feeling.  Once the tube is in place, the legs are straightened and her gown or even a blanket will be put over her, so that she is not exposed.  At that point, the radiologist will enter the room.  While watching in real time on a TV screen, the radiologist will start allowing the contrast to fill the bladder, via the catheter.  Your daughter will probably be able to see this as well.  Eventually, her bladder will start telling her brain that she needs to urinate.  We want the bladder to get fairly full.  They are looking to make sure the valves at the UPJ (ureteropelvic junction-where the ureters enter the bladder) are competent.  They should not open and allow fluid from the bladder to enter the ureters.  Once your daughter feels full, she will be asked to pee on the x-ray table.  They will put towels between her legs, and she will be covered.  Peeing on the table is important, because sometimes with the pressure, the urine will leave the bladder and enter the ureter.  IF a patient cannot pee on the table (and some cannot for modesty issues), we will take out the catheter tube and have her pee in the toilet in private.  After emptying the bladder, she will be asked to hustle back to the x-ray table for a picture to make sure there is no contrast in the ureters.    There really is no side effects post procedure.  She will not leak contrast or have pain.  So whatever she wants to wear is fine.  The worst part of this study is the embarassment of the catheterization.  And as long as you are not pregnant, you should be allowed to wear a leaded apron and stay in the room with her, if she wishes.\\n\\nAnother good idea:  When they catheterize your daughter, you can get a \"clean catch\" of urine.  Make sure they give you some of this clean catch for testing.  When you urinate into a cup, it is possible for contamination from the labia etc.  A clean catch is just urine, and nothing else.  Our pediatric group in town always wants the parent to bring a clean catch to them so they can test it for bacteria.  Find out if this is something they want you to do before the procedure begins.  It may save your daughter from having to be catheterized for a clean catch later on.\n\nAnswer:",

Tradition is no reason to continue a practice.  To say that we should prohibit gays from marrying because we have not allowed it up til now and marriage has traditionally be between a man and a woman it no different that that standard answer your parents gave you when you asked why you could not eat your dessert first -- \"because we say so.\"  Makes no sense.  It offers no logic.  Guess what else is tradition -- traditionally we don't let jews play at our golf courses.  And traditionally we don't let blacks marry whites (there were actually laws on the book in most states, so it went beyond tradition, it was the law).  Traditionally, children slept on their stomaches, until the scientists told us that the chances of SIDS skyrocketed when an infant doesn't sleep on its back.  So don't give me that tradition garbage.  We don't continue doing things just because that how it has always been done.  The american people deserve better than that -- we deserve to know how it benefits the overall society.  The bottomline is that monogomy and marital committment is a major benefit to modern society, whether it is between opposite sexes or the same sexes.\n\nAnswer:",

I was one month over 65 when I contacted them. The job centre advised me 65 does not apply it means 65 or when you retire finally.  The pensions help line told me that decision is rubbish. I appealed against the decision based on when they created this situation when I was age 63years. the offending dept will not let me appeal and although I appealed the enquiry said I cant appeal as they refuse to turm it down so its not available to appeal against. what a waste of time, democracy!!\nAnswer: Sorry for your problems, but that's what you get for expecting anything from socialist governments, and why it is better to provide for yourself rather than expecting it to be provided for you.\\n\\nBecause the government that has the power to provide you with all that you want, has the power to take all that you have.\n\nAnswer:",

Do Americans realize that freedom costs, and it is not money? It is won with dedication and patroitism. Are all Americans to be critized for a few of uneducated individuals who is afraid to hurt some feelings in the world of today? No wonder 9/11 happened.What happened to the respect of US citizens towards our own country? This country is the best and why do we have to put our ownselves thru this hell of destroying our own country.\nAnswer: No. If we continue on in this manner we are doomed to self destruct and become a second world country. The number one problem with the American people is that we for some reason think that only people who have never struggled to make it understand the needs of the other 85% of Americans.\n\nAnswer:",

However, I haven't been able to really put my finger on why.  Of course, what's not to like about animes, mangas, and fics with lots of hot, steamy sex?  But I mean the yaoi and slash genres in particular.  I know the fandom for these genres is largely young adult women.  Any theories why?\nAnswer: Yes, several - I'm not sure if any of them is \"right\", though.\\n\\nSome friends have suggested to me that it could be something similar to straight males liking lesbian porn - you get to read or write about two characters you like going at it without any women, who a large proportion of the fandom will not be attracted to, involved to get in the way. However, that still wouldn't explain why I like it, since I'm more attracted to other women than I am to men.\\n\\nIt could partly be the novelty of it - male/male sex and relationships are things that a woman cannot experience in real life so fanfiction could be a good way to explore these things if you're curious about them but don't want to do anything drastic.\\n\\nIn fandom for some animes/mangas/etc. it could also be partly due to the lack of interesting female characters; if the women aren't interesting in canon you're not going to find them interesting when you read about them in a fic, no matter what they're doing with each other or with the male characters.\\n\\nA male/male relationship could also seem more equal, and with a same-sex relationship a woman might feel like there was more freedom for the characters not to behave in the way they would be expected to if they were in a relationship with a female (if that makes sense). In a straight relationship there are roles which each person is kind of expected to take based on their sex (maybe not so much in real life, but in things like movies and TV shows), slash may make it easier for a woman to write about or imagine the characters in a relationship without using these roles.\n\nAnswer:",

A good friend is happy for you and supportive when great things happen in your life. However sometimes even good friends become jealous perhaps because they are going through rough times or they have yet to acieve their own goals or they are lacking love at the moment, any number of reasons. In this instance if you have something they don't and they desire having the same,it is only human nature to be jealous. How the jealousy is displayed determines the depth of character/friendship. Is she laughing and smiling and screeching \"I am so jealous, but good for you\" or is she tense, a little distant, and crying or scowling. This is unhealthy jealousy, for she is jealous with an envious heart that may create problems for the friendship. If she is vindictive then in her jealousy she may try to bring about the downfall of your happiness. But if she jealous AND supportive, well cut her some slack and try to be empathic.\n\nAnswer:",

I find this interesting.\nAnswer: That's because in general men (myself included) tend to be more visual and look for an instant attraction.  A woman is more likely to take the time to make an assessment of a man's character, his sense of humor and wit, whether he's interesting etc.  The first cut, if you will, for a man is physical attractiveness.  While for women, that criteria may be down the line a little and she is more likely to give a guy a chance who fits all her other criteria but may not be the best looking guy.\n\nAnswer:",

He lied to the world by saying Iraq had WMD, which they dont. \\n\\nBush wanted to win popularity in America and make a new ally in the Middle East. he failed in both areas.\n\nAnswer:",

This may be asking a lot, but what is your financial strategy for a good steady level of growth?\nAnswer: That other answer is not entirely true.  CDs are not backed by the full afaith and credit of the US, they are backed by the FDIC.  That means if the bank fails, your deposit is safe.  Only US Treasuries are backed by the full faith and credit of the US government.\\n\\nYou need to figure out how long you plan on saving for.  If it really is one year, then stick with CDs.  If it's 10 years, you should look at high quality mutual funds that have a decent ten year track record (or longer) and are low cost.  \\n\\nYou may want to consider working with an advisor and put together a solid strategy.  Ask your friends and family who they use and then make sure you know how they get paid.  A good advisor is worth the price, just make sure you find one that's ethical!\n\nAnswer:",

Choose one from the option.\nOption: Society & Culture, Science & Mathematics, Health, Education & Reference, Computers & Internet, Sports, Business & Finance, Entertainment & Music, Family & Relationships, Politics & Government \nQuestion: what is the relation of the mass of stars to its evolution?\nAnswer: Star formation occurs in molecular clouds, large regions of high density in the interstellar medium (though still less dense than the inside of an earthly vacuum chamber). Star formation begins with gravitational instability inside those clouds, often triggered by shockwaves from supernovae or collision of two galaxies (as in a starburst galaxy). High mass stars powerfully illuminate the clouds from which they formed. One example of such a nebula is the Orion Nebula.\\n\\nStars spend about 90% of their lifetime fusing hydrogen to produce helium in high-temperature and high-pressure reactions near the core. Such stars are said to be on the main sequence.\\n\\nSmall stars (called red dwarfs) burn their fuel very slowly and last tens to hundreds of billions of years. At the end of their lives, they simply become dimmer and dimmer, fading into black dwarfs. However, since the lifespan of such stars is greater than the current age of the universe (13.7 billion years), no black dwarfs exist yet.\\n\\nAs most stars exhaust their supply of hydrogen, their outer layers expand and cool to form a red giant. In about 5 billion years, when the Sun is a red giant, it will be so large that it will consume both Mercury and Venus. Eventually the core is compressed enough to start helium fusion, and the star heats up and contracts. Larger stars will also fuse heavier elements, all the way to iron, which is the end point of the process. Since iron nuclei are more tightly bound than any heavier nuclei, they cannot be fused to release energy. Likewise, since they are more tightly bound than all lighter nuclei, energy cannot be released by fission. In old, very massive stars, a large core of inert iron will accumulate in the center of the star.\\n\\nAn average-size star will then shed its outer layers as a planetary nebula. The core that remains will be a tiny ball of degenerate matter not massive enough for further fusion to take place, supported only by degeneracy pressure, called a white dwarf. These too will fade into black dwarfs over very long stretches of time.\\n\\n \\nThe Crab Nebula, remnants of a supernova which occurred around 1050 AD.In larger stars, fusion continues until an iron core accumulates that is too large to be supported by electron degeneracy pressure. This core will suddenly collapse as its electrons are driven into its protons, forming neutrons and neutrinos in a burst of inverse beta decay. The shockwave formed by this sudden collapse causes the rest of the star to explode in a supernova. Supernovae are so bright that they may briefly outshine the star's entire home galaxy. When they occur within the Milky Way, supernovae have historically been observed by naked-eye observers as \"new stars\" where none existed before. Eventually, most of the matter in a star is blown away by the explosion (forming nebulae such as the Crab Nebula) and what remains will be a neutron star (sometimes a pulsar or X-ray burster) or, in the case of the largest stars, a black hole.\\n\\nThe blown-off outer layers of dying stars include heavy elements which may be recycled during new star formation. These heavy elements allow the formation of rocky planets. The outflow from supernovae and the stellar wind of large stars play an important part in shaping the interstellar medium.\n\nAnswer:",

But do something everyday, and you can see the results later.\\n\\nSome ideas:\\n\\n1. Create the best content you can. Your content is your best advertisement - if visitors love your content, then they will go back and spread the word to others.\\n\\n2. Make it easy for users to recommend your site. Viral marketing is very important -- and easy to tap on the Web. But give your users the tools. Get a Recommend this Site script from websites such as cgiscripts.com and similar directories of scripts. Some even go as far as giving incentives to those who recommend the site to their friends. \\n\\n3. Rank well in the search engines (organic search results, not the pay per click). SEs can be a big source of traffic. The key is to create the best content in your niche. If you have good content, other websites will gladly link to you and offer your site as a resource to their audience. Check the on-page factors and be sure to get linked from authority sites in your topic area.\\n\\n4. Send out press releases. While outfits charge as much as $650 per release, there are free press release submission places on the Web. Press releases allow you to (a) attract media attention; (b) get more back links to your website without sending each website an email request; and (c) get more visibility especially if your press release gets in Google News or Yahoo News.\\n\\n5. Submit articles. Write articles and submit them to websites accepting author submissions. You get exposure for your business; establishes you as an authority in your field, and allows you to get backlinks for your website. Be sure to have About the Author blurb at the end of the article with your website URL\n\nAnswer:",

It orbits between 29 and 49 AU from the Sun, and was the first Kuiper Belt Object to be discovered. Approximately one-fifth the mass of the Earth's Moon, Pluto is primarily composed of rock and ice. It has an eccentric orbit that is highly inclined with respect to the planets and takes it closer to the Sun than Neptune during a portion of its orbit. Pluto and its largest satellite, Charon, could be considered a binary system because they are closer in size than any of the other known planetoid/moon combinations in the solar system, and because the barycentre of their orbits does not lie within either body. However, the International Astronomical Union (IAU) has yet to formalize a definition for binary dwarf planets, so Charon is regarded as a moon of Pluto. Two smaller moons, Nix and Hydra, were discovered in 2005. Pluto is smaller than several of the natural satellites or moons in our solar system (see the list of solar system objects by radius).\\n\\nFrom its discovery by Clyde Tombaugh in 1930, Pluto was considered the ninth planet from the Sun. In the late 20th and early 21st century, many similar objects were discovered in the outer solar system, most notably the Trans-Neptunian object Eris which is slightly larger than Pluto. In August 2006 the IAU redefined the term \"planet\", and classified Pluto, Ceres, and Eris as dwarf planets.[1] Pluto is also classified as the prototype of a family of trans-Neptunian objects.[2][3] After the reclassification, Pluto was added to the list of minor planets and given the number 134340.[4][5]\\n\\nContents [hide]\\n1 Discovery \\n1.1 Relations to Neptune and Uranus \\n1.2 Percival Lowell's influence \\n1.3 Naming \\n1.4 Symbol \\n2 Physical characteristics \\n2.1 Appearance \\n2.2 Mass and size \\n2.3 Atmosphere \\n2.4 Composition \\n2.5 Orbit \\n2.5.1 Heliocentric distance \\n2.6 Trans-Neptunian object \\n2.7 Comet comparison \\n3 Moons \\n3.1 Charon \\n3.2 Nix and Hydra \\n3.3 Distribution \\n3.4 Additional moons? \\n4 Exploration of Pluto \\n5 Planetary status controversy \\n5.1 Omission from museum models \\n5.2 Commemoration as a planet \\n5.3 New discoveries ignite debate \\n5.4 IAU Decisio\n\nAnswer:",

I had originally told my girlfriend I would do a lot of shopping for her while in Europe. As a college student, I don't have much money, but I'm by no means broke. I bought her a nice traditional garnet/gold ring in Prague for her birthday and figured that was better than buying her a nice outfit. I am debating about whether to do a shopping spree for her here and just give her the things when I get back, or saving my money now and just taking her out for a surprise date in which I'd take her out for a really nice date and pay for a manicure/pedicure and possibly the perm she wants, take her to the scrapbook store to buy some new things (she loves that), and possibly buy her a really nice set of hair care products too. Do you think that is all better than trying to buy her some random clothes here? I may still get her some lingerie here, but I could buy her a few outfits but then I'd spend all my money here.\nAnswer: Don't spend \"all\" your money, but do buy her some presents while you are away.  It shows that you were thinking of her all the time you were apart, and if you wait until you get back home, it will look like you are making a lame effort to catch up. Just save a little for something special when you get home.\\n\\nAlso, you should write to her to let her know what you are doing.  (\"I got you a really nice outfit today.  I was going to get two of them, but I want to save some money to get you something else when we are back together.\")\\n\\nGood luck!  I hope she appreciates you.\n\nAnswer:",

If for nothing else, space exploration will provide us a competitive edge in the world market, by developing new technologies, and possibly answers to the deepest questions of mankind.\n\nAnswer:",

People who obsess about what they eat generally give up quickly. If you really want ice cream, have ice cream. Not \"once a week\". Just when you REALLY want it. But before you choose a high-calorie, low-nutrition food, think about it.\\n\\n1. You should be eating six small meals a day - not three large ones. Even if you arn't really hungry, sit down and eat a small meal. Eat at 8, 10, 12, 3, 6 and 8. And if you want to snack between, and don't think you can wait, go ahead. And I fully endorse a bed-time snack.\\n\\n2. When you eat, eat foods that will keep you full. ie: whole grains.\\n\\n3. If you want that snack in-between, but arn't sure you need it, drink an 8 oz glass of water or juice or tea and wait 15 min. If you still want a snack, have one. Often, you'll find that your body was saying \"drink\" and you heard \"eat\".\\n\\n4. Consider a healthier alternative. That's healthier - not low-fat. If you want strawberry ice cream, no amount of non-fat strawberry yogurt is going to help. But a rich, creamy Dannon Fruit-on-the-Bottom might just satisfy that craving. (or two- those cups are small) And since it provides the nutrients your body wants, it just may keep you from craving more, especially if you add some whole grain cereal on the top, or pair it with some whole-wheat toast or a granola bar.\n\nAnswer:",

I don't think that Primus has been on SNL more than once, but I saw them play one song several years ago while watching and I had never heard of them at the time. I didn't know the name of the band until afterwards and I never found out the name of the song I heard. I have two of their albums, but my favorite songs was the one I heard on SNL and one I heard them play in the movie, Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure (although, I'm not sure if their appearance in the show played the same song as the one on the album, which I already know the name of). This is a tough question, but if anyone knows the SNL song(s) or how I can find out, I'd greatly appreciate it. I don't use Google much anymore cuz I can't seem to find out the stuff I need to know all the time like before.\nAnswer: played Roulette but without the solo dammit\n\nAnswer:",

Unlike the myths that some perpetuate, federal government and even private foundations hardly give grant money for a for-profit business. And yes, grants mean PAPERWORK - lots and lots of it, that is why a cottage industry of grant writers was born.\\n\\nNonetheless, you can go to the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance (CFDA) http://www.cfda.gov and Grants.gov http://www.grants.gov - these are two sites created by the federal government to provide transparency and information on grants. Browse through the listings and see if you can find any grant that would support a for-profit venture.\\n\\nEven if you buy books on \"how to get grants\" or list that supposedly has information on grants -- all of them are mere rehash of what CFDA has, albeit packaged differently. But still the info is the same - hardly any grants for starting a for profit business.\\n\\nEven SBA does NOT give out grants. From the SBA website http://www.sba.gov/expanding/grants.html... \\n\\n\"The U.S. Small Business Administration does not offer grants to start or expand small businesses, although it does offer a wide variety of loan programs. (See http://www.sba.gov/financing for more information) While SBA does offer some grant programs, these are generally designed to expand and enhance organizations that provide small business management, technical, or financial assistance. These grants generally support non-profit organizations, intermediary lending institutions, and state and local governments.\"\\n\\nMost of the federal grants are given to specific target groups with specific requirements (e.g. minority business owners involved in transportation related contracts emanating from DOT - Grant#20.905 Disadvantaged Business Enterprises Short Term Lending Program \\n\\nGrants are also often given to non profit groups or organizations involved in training or other similar activities (grant 59.043 Women's Business Ownership Assistance that are given to those who will create women's business center that will train women entrepreneurs \\n\\nFor private grants, you may want to check the Foundation Center's Foundation Grants for Individuals Online. It's a subscription based website ($9.95 per month) but their opening blurb only says that the database is ideal for \"students, artists, academic researchers, libraries and financial aid offices.\" Entrepreneurs are apparently not one of them, so I take it they also don't have listings of private foundations who give grants to would-be entrepreneurs.\n\nAnswer:",

If she is your friend and like a second mother to you then don't befriend her because your family as a problem with her. That's not fair to her and friends don't do that to each other. If I threw away friends because my family didn't like them I would be pretty much friendless. If your family are going to act that way towards anyone over something that was said so minor. Then your friend don't need them in her life. It will be their loss not hers. Good Luck!!!!\n\nAnswer:",

This is an estimate, of course, as there is no way to track polygamists for sure.  The marriage ceremonies aren't legal so they are done in privacy and the families usually live separately from one another, so there's no way to know for sure who's a polygamist and who isn't.  A majority of polygamists live in Utah, but they can also be found throughout the country.  There are also \"polygamist cities\" such as Colorado City in Arizona and Bonners Ferry in Idaho where the majority of the population pracitices polygamy.\n\nAnswer:",

Why?\nQuestion: I can even feel the presence of true christians. I'm afraid to let them look into my eyes. It has always been like this.. All of my life even when I was a little boy it was like this. Dispite this When I was 6 years old I wanted a picture of Jesus on the cross. I wanted to see the blood and I wanted to see the lifeless look on his face. I wanted to see the nails through him and the blood running down. Why am I like this? Why am I afraid to let a Christain look into my eyes? I've always been afraid to discuss this with my family so that is why I came here. Please give me an answer I really don't understand this..\nAnswer: It does not sound like a logical fear to me.  Then again this is coming from a guy scared of heights.\\n\\nPerhaps you are scared that they are going to enslave you with their religion.  The best way to overcome this fear is probly knowing more about how and why people join cults.  Once you know how to avoid being brainwashed you woln't have to fear looking them in the eyes and telling them they are wrong.\n\nAnswer:",

I can work on improving it and measure every little thing I do.\\n\\nCTR is something I cannot estimate. It will depend on the website type, I imagine. (imisidro) Your website looks like an information site, so your CTR would be similar to the one I would expect. May I inquire what CTR it might average? Anyone else that has a CTR for a site that would help me?\\n\\nThe earnings per click are 70% of what google makes is this true? Also how can I estimate this number for a given topic. It is easy to tell what it will cost at google adwords to place 1-3 or 4-6 or 7-10 on a given keyword, are any of these good numbers to use as average?\\n\\nthanks for ALL thoughts on the matter\nAnswer: You are forgetting something in your formula = smart pricing. \\n\\nSmart pricing is the big unknown that can significantly reward or discount your clicks. In the email sent in 2004  by Google when it introduced smart pricing https://adwords.google.com/select/news/sa_mar04.html they explain smart pricing as \\n\\n\"if our data shows that a click is less likely to turn into business results (e.g. online sale, registration, phone call, newsletter sign-up), we may reduce the price you pay for that click ... We take into account many factors such as what keywords or concepts triggered the ad, as well as the type of site on which the ad was served. For example, a click on an ad for digital cameras on a web page about photography tips may be worth less than a click on the same ad appearing next to a review of digital cameras.\"\\n\\nSo it is not a straightforward estimate - an advertiser paying $0.10 cents for a click from content network (Adsense publishers) does not give you assurance that you get 70 cents (assuming a 70-30 split with Google and publisher). It could be more, or it could be less depending on how smart pricing looks at your site. Webmasters continue to dissect what it is, how it actually works, how often it is applied -- and WebmasterWorld alone has hundreds of threads on this topic.\\n\\nThe other factors are something you can control: ad impressions you can work to increase your traffic; CTR with your ad placement and layout. My site, an information site, is a perfect vehicle for Adsense and we get very good results (double digit CTR, and 5-digit monthly income). [Sorry can't reveal much lest I be in violation of Adsense TOS]\\n\\nBut not all websites fit well with the program, as we wrote in the article \"Contextual Advertising: Why Are You Earning Only Pennies?\" http://www.powerhomebiz.com/022006/adsense.htm -- but it is how you experiment and play around the variables that you can control that can result to your earnings. Markus Finch's PlentyofFish.com website earned millions because he has gargantuan traffic, even though his CPM and EPC are paltry. Fos us, we continue to experiment with the colors of the Adlinks, how to space the large rectangles, etc.\\n\\nOne excellent resource I suggest if you want more to understand Adsense is the Jensense blog http://www.jensense.com/ - this is written by the moderator of the Adsense forum at WebmasterWorld (Jenstar). You can learn a lot from reading her blog as she is very knowledgeable of the topic.\\n\\nPS. Thank you for the invite to answer your question :o)\n\nAnswer:",

It is true that, in a garrison environment, most marines (save flight crews, CFR, SAR, PMO, & some others) enjoy a very relaxed work week- I say this viewing it from the other side- I was an MP who worked on average 60 hours a week- literally almost twice the hours most other Marines worked.    \\nIn that sense, being admin, or cook, or stich b*tch is cake, but as the first guy said, deployments happen. A LOT.  In that case, virtually every one will be required to work in extreme conditions (including combat) and for ungodly periods of time.  There is a mission to be accomplished, regardless of any other concern.  As hard and dangerous as it may be, it is strangly satisfying and kinda fun- in a masochistic way.  I got out in May- and love being a bearded  nasty civilian- but I really miss it like crazy.  \\n\\nWhatever you decide, take your time and be sure.  You will never know what it will be like- no one can really tell you what it will do to or for YOU, but at least make your choice with due diligence.\\nHonestly, I really want to help you.

Virtually any organ can be affected, however, granulomas most often appear in the lungs (D860) or the lymph nodes (D861). Symptoms can occasionally appear suddenly but more often than not appear gradually. When viewing X-rays of the lungs, sarcoidosis can have the appearance of tuberculosis or lymphoma.\n\nAnswer:",

It's not just the misspellings and poor grammar that's destroying our glorious English language, it's also the acceptance, use and abuse of so-called netspeak and text messaging. My fear is for the future because most people engaging in this are college age and younger. I worry that some (most?) of these people don't actually KNOW correct grammar, spelling, punctuation, etc. And because of the new technology (to say nothing of really bad attitudes) they don't care. Books and newspapers will doubtless go the way of the horse and carriage. What do you think? Is this forecast too bleak? What is the future of the English language?\nAnswer: The English language as known to Shakespeare no longer exists and has long been replaced by the English as we know it today. Language is culture-specific, it mirrors the age in which it is used .So there must be something in the present-day culture that drives youngsters to such blatant abuse of a well-preserved language, perhaps they find the \"Kewl\" element missing in regular well-structured language. \\nInternet cannot be blamed for that, technology has always had its own pros and cons. Perhaps the \"instant\" nature of all things(communication,frienship,relationship etc.) in this age leaves people with little patience which reflects in the language. Yes it will change in form, but language cannot be killed as long as humans have enough to express.\n\nAnswer:",

If a man gets into bed with another man, while that other man is WITH a woman, the two men shall be put to death for this abomination? Is it possible this pasage refers to two men taking advantage of a woman?? That group sex is wrong, not GAY sex? And it says nothing about two women lying together anywhere in the Bible does it? And isn't two women lying together the same supposed \"sin\" as two men lying togeher? I think the church is wrong! This passage has been misunderstood! What do you all think? Serious, honest answers only.\nAnswer: You make some very good points. The bible was written in a time when homosexuality wasnt very common, people read into it much too far and take something out of it that could very well be not true.\n\nAnswer:",

Browse through the listings and see if you can find any grant that would support your purposes.\\n\\nEven if you buy books on \"how to get grants\" or list that supposedly has information on grants -- all of them are mere rehash of what CFDA has, albeit packaged differently.\\n\\nNote though that these grants generally support non-profit organizations, intermediary lending institutions, and state and local governments. Most of the federal grants are given to specific target groups with specific requirements (e.g. minority business owners involved in transportation related contracts emanating from DOT - Grant#20.905 Disadvantaged Business Enterprises Short Term Lending Program. Individuals especially for personal purposes are not eligible for federal grants. \\n\\nGrants are also often given to non profit groups or organizations involved in training or other similar activities (grant 59.043 Women's Business Ownership Assistance that are given to those who will create women's business center that will train women entrepreneurs \\n\\nThe government is NOT in the business of giving away free money for the sake of giving away money. Grants are free, but it means OBLIGATION. You will be obligated to do as the grant sets out to do. Grants have objectives, and your purpose must fit the objective of the grant.\\n\\nFor one, you have to write the grant application and the grant application is not a simple document - you have to explain how your purpose for applying for the grant fits well with the objectives set out by the grant. Grants have objectives, and the grant applications that best captures the grant's objectives are approved.\\n\\nThere is a stringent review process through a committee composed of federal employees and selected experts in the field. You will compete with other applicants for the grant money, and this grant review committee will evaluate the merits of each proposal. Only those that they feel exemplifies the objective of the grant will be approved.\n\nAnswer:",

It is usually 4-5ft deep and the banks are nothing extraordinary, no retaining walls etc. I would like to determine the volume of water for chemical treatment purposes. The formula would be even better. (you might have to dumb it down a bit). Thanks\nAnswer: If it's an ellipse the area is pi*r1*r2, r1 and r2 being the semimajor and semiminor axes. This is 3.14*25*9 ~= 705 sq. ft. You'll have to estimate the average depth. If it's 4 feet you have 4*705 ~= 2820 cu ft. There are ~7.5 gallons in a cu ft, so that's 7.5*2820 ~= 21200 gallons.\n\nAnswer:",

I don't love anything \"THAT\" much to dedicate my \"entire\" life to. I am in college but only because I don't know what else to do. I can see me getting a major in something and going with that, but knowing myself, I know for a complete fact I'll get board with it in a couple of years and there I'll be, having to go find something else to do. What should I do?\nAnswer: Imagine that you have graduated college and you need to get a job RIGHT NOW.  The pressure is on....so you have to decide, you should  look in the paper or yahoo hot-jobs under different sections and see if anything looks appealing.  The first thing you need to do is eliminate something.  There are a few basic categories of careers: Finance, business, medicine, psychology.  Many people go with psych cause it's easy and interesting to study in college (but remember  picture yourself out of college) but once you get out unless you get your PhD or become a therapist ect, there's not much you can do with that.  So then take medicine, can you see yourself as a doctor or a nurse?   Or can you see more possibilities and expansion in business or finance.  If you want to work for a company maybe you should go with business cause in business there are so many different branches that you can explore.  I hope this helps but ultimately you need to eliminate things before just choosing something.   Just get a bachelors in something broad enough to be appealing for many different companies or whatever broad field you find desirable\n\nAnswer:",

I'd been walking briskly around the store before I used the machine.\\n\\nI was shocked by the numbers! My systolic pressure was elevated, and my diastolic was VERY elevated! I waited a few minutes, then did it again and both numbers were PERFECTLY NORMAL. I asked a pharmacist how accurate the machine was, because this seemed weird, especially since only a month ago, I had my BP taken by my doctor and it, too, was normal.\\n\\nThe pharmacist said to sit for another minute and take a THIRD reading, then go with whatever 2 out of the 3 readings indicated. I did that, and the third reading was also normal. I felt very good about that. However....\\n\\nI'm concerned whether my BP rises to dangerous levels when I'm exercising. It's great that it's normal and healthy when I'm sitting around doing nothing, but why was it so high, albeit TEMPORARILY, just from walking briskly in the store?\nAnswer: Physical exertion raises blood pressure, but if your bp has been normal, and returns to normal quickly after you return to rest you have nothing to worry about. If your resting bp is also high, then you have medical hypertension. In your case you sound like a healthy person, whose bp simply elevated to match your exertion. Any time you are physically active, your blood pressure should elevate to provide the needed oxygen, nutrients to the muscles. The muscles themselves help to increase circulation, thereby raising bp, by compressing veins during contraction, which forces the blood to return to the heart at a higher rate. Remember to get plenty of exercise, eat right, and have regular physicals......... Good luck, and I hope you remain healthy in the future.\n\nAnswer:",

GP's learn acupuncture as an extra but a Middlesex university student with a 4 year degree in traditional chinese medicine and a stint of training in mainland china hospitals(where western and chinese medicine are practised side by side) is not allowed to practice acupuncture on the NHS.  Their degree course includes western anatomy and biochemistry btw.  London has it's own Ayurvedic hospital and Ayurvedic medicine has a history longer than chinese medicine.  it is not accepted yet, i still have to meet my first obese peron from India! \\nPhysiotherapy and osteopathy have humongous waiting lists.  \\nThe list goes on.  \\nBack to to the original question ...\nAnswer: In the US it is the same but with insurance companies.  They will pay if you go to a doctor who took 100 hours of acupuncture classes  but not if you go to someone who has a degree from an acupuncture school(one in Massachusetts takes 6 years to get).   Multiculturalism is all crap anyways.  Come to my city and see how \"great\" it supposedly is\n\nAnswer:",

Which is preferred to avoid sin offen?\nQuestion: Both masturbating and promiscuity (that is sleeping with either a man or woman without being formally married) is sinful and both could not be condolled by God hence abstainess from both masturbation and promiscuity is the only way to please God concerning this aspect of sin. As a true believer in the word of God, unmarried man or woman must not indulge in sex until they are married and pronounced husband and wife in the church of God by the Bishop, Apostle, Pastor or any clegy in charge in such a church; or joined in the registery as man and wife or even in the traditional way as it may be in your locality. Nigeria as a case study, marriage could be contracted in the mosque, at the family home of the woman (intended to be married out) whereby all the family members of the woman (both parternal and maternal) and the family of the intended husband will be present to solemnize the two people and they shall become one and live together thereafter as husband and wife.\nAnswer: If you have to choose the lesser evil, than go for masturbation. God's purpose for sex is for procreation between a husband and a wife. Obviously, to have premarital sex sins against the procreation part, and the the being unwed part. Plus, you're involving someone else with your sin. If you're masturbating, you are alone...and you're actually not preventing procreation because there is no woman. \\n\\nGod understands that people have freewill and are generally 'weak'. God wants people to live according to his wishes, but he also understands that it is difficult.\n\nAnswer:",

What that means is that code that is written to make the final software is freely available for modification and reuse - given that you release your modifications to the public.\\n\\nWindows is a line of products released by Microsoft. Unlike Linux, MS does not release the code of there operating system (OS). Windows XP is the latest version of there OS.\\n\\nLinux in its bare-bone format is not easily usable. To be able to use it you need some software that run on it and some drivers to identify your hardware. Normally Linux comes with a lot of software that is developed by under the GNU project by volunteers for the Free Software Foundation. Under this form Linux is called GNU/Linux.\\n\\nSince Linux can be modified a lot of vendors have released their own version of Linux one of those vendors is RedHat. They release Fedora Linux for the public and RedHat Linux for corporate use. It differs from bare bone Linux in that it comes with an installer and several useful utilities and programs developed either under GNU or by Red hat or by other companies mostly under the same license - GPL.\\n\\nSo primarily the difference is that Linux can be modified but Windows can not. But there are several other finer differences. For most people Linux is about choice. Anyway you can read the details here http://www.michaelhorowitz.com/Linux.vs.Windows.html\n\nAnswer:",

There is no justification for this, especially when there are so many alternatives. The school should know that 'ink pens' are designed only for right-handers who can pull the nib across the paper; left-handers try (unsuccessfully) to push it.\\nAsk the school what equipment it has for left-handers who make up about 10% of its pupils. This could be inexpensive things such as left-handed scissors and certainly suitable desks and work-spaces. If they have not, why not?\\n\\nI am left-handed.

What happens to the water level of the lake when you throw the body overboard?\nAnswer: The water level will go down when you throw the body in.  Try it in your sink.  Fill your sink with water and float a bowl (boat) in it.  Then, fill the bowl with silver wear (body and rocks) or anything more dense than water.  Mark where the water level is on the side of the sink.  Now, take the silver wear out, and put it in the water so it falls to the bottom of the sink.  You will notice that the water level went down.  When the silver was in the bowl, it displaced much more water than when it was at the bottom of the sink.  Therefore, the body will displace more water when it is inside the boat than when it falls into the water.\n\nAnswer:",

As far as I can tell (not very far, I'm a newbie), the rim and tire look fine, but the inner tube and the stem seem to have come apart from each other, which obviously leaves a nice big hole in the inner tube.\\n\\nI'm hoping to eventually use the bike as my main commuter vehicle, so I'm trying to figure out exactly what went wrong, and how not to run into this particular trouble again. My (stupid newbie) guess is that this indicates there was too much air in the tube... is that a good guess? Or can this flat happen for other reasons? Because the stem is on the inside of the wheel, I'm not sure the terrain would have anything to do with it.\\n\\nAs an added bonus question, since I'll be picking up a replacement soon, what sort of tubes do you recommend? And does rider weight have any bearing on the sort of tubes to buy?\\n\\nThanks in advance!\nAnswer: What it sounds like was that you didn't have enough air in the tube. When the pressure is too low, the tire & tube slide on the rim as you brake. The result is usually a cut in the valve stem or the valve stem can get completely cut away from the tube.  Rider weight does not affect the tube. If you're going to commute, go with a puncture or thorn resistant tube. It costs a little more, but is made from a heavier rubber and less prone to pinch flats & punctures. The \"slime\" filled tubes will usually stop small punctures but only make a mess when it comes to large punctures or cuts.\n\nAnswer:",

That is obvious. For some reason we are NOT to know more about the details. Probably because it is part of the plan. If we knew more it would alter our behaviour. This way humans develop to their true self. If the spirit they contain is that of the light it will go to the light. If they belong to the spirit of destruction they will inherit destruction. This way the \"secrets of many hearts will become revealed\". \\nBUT (!) No human is to decide who belongs where. God forbade even to the angels -way ahead of us in the circle- to judge. Judgement is only God's. We are to love and help each other. And we are to gide those who have eares to hear to the light. If they are that of the light they will listen and become what they are: One with the light.\\nPeace to you, friend!\n\nAnswer:",

To do so it must accurately dedect the line voltage and electrical current entering your house.  The meter contains an aluminum disk that you can see spinning fast or slow depending upon how many (or few) electrical devices you have turned on.  Inside the meter there are two coils of wire (one on top and one on the bottom of the disk).  One coil senses instaneous voltage that can vary (and even droop in a brownout).  The other coil detects all the current you are using, if any.  With your main circuit breaker open there will be none.  When there is both voltage and current flowing, magnetic eddies are produced that measure and integrate the power being used by spinning the aluminum disk (like a small motor) which is connected to a set of gears that turn the meter numerals.  See the link for an illustration and detailed explanation.  Good luck.\n\nAnswer:",

I worked with children at a hospital and sessions were at 8:30 & you were required to be there 30min before to set up, and basically I was getting there between 8 and 8:15 or sometimes closer to 8:20, and I was pretty stupid because I got warned a couple times, however I never thought it would come down to me getting fired. I was however a good employee, I got along with everyone, was good with the kids, knew what I was doing, and all that good stuff. SO I have a job interview coming up and I KNOW that I am very qualified for the position, and it's a position I REALLY want (I didn't even LIKE my last job anyway- blessing in disguise?). And if it wasn't for the attendance problems, I would be confident that I would get the job. My problem is how should I discuss firing in the interview? I read that you should bring it up before they even ask you but also you should not ever say you had attendance problems.\nAnswer: Do not bring it up unless asked.\\n\\nYour former employer BY LAW is only allowed to verify the dates of employment, position and compensation....that is LAW.\\n\\nHowever....some employers will take liberties and attempt to blacken your name.\\n\\nHave a friend call your former employer under the guise of a hiring manager for XYZ company...and have them ask about your employment etc. You will then have a heads up on the type of answer/reference your former boss is handing out to the people calling in.

You must get in her head and have her thinking about you. You must make her feel comfortable with you. \\nListen and talk to her. Women love to talk! They feel closer to you if you listen and remember what you talked about. In a way, words are a form of intercourse for a woman because it's the only thing they have with which to establish trust with you. A woman will tell you exactly how and when she wants to be seduced if you just shut up and listen to her. \\nTake things slowly. Show her that you're patient; your ability to resist her will make her wonder if you're really interested, and will motivate her to show you that she's worth being interested in. \\nKiss with your eyes first. Women need to feel a connection with you. You begin this connection through your words and then your eyes. If you can keep her eyes on yours, and hypnotize her with your words, you are halfway there. \\nIncrease the physical intimacy. You have to be careful with this one. Don't be eager or aggressive. Begin touching a woman with simple hugs, pats on the back, etc. Then gradually increase it by bringing her in closer...kiss with your eyes! Then move on to simple kisses (pecks). Again, take it slow. \\nTalk about sex or sexy things. At some point, begin to talk about sex...not between the two of you, but general experiences you've had. Once you inject the topic of sex, it will be on their mind when they think about you. With women, it's all about familiarity and safety. Talking about the act makes them more comfortable with the act. \\nTell a woman you want her. Pick the right time, but be clear that you want her (not in a cheesy way ['I want you baby'] but in a tender way). She needs to know you want a time and place for the act. Gauge her reaction. If she is ready, then plan on setting up the situation for it to happen. \\nWhen it's the right time, always ask for permission ('Is this okay?') and be ready to back off at any time if she is not ready. \\nRespect a woman at all times. She is not a piece of meat but a human being with feelings. If you are out to 'get some,' then you are not seducing a woman. You are merely an animal in heat. \\nFind a good form of interaction, one that works best for you. If you need time to think about what you're going to say, maybe email or IM will work best for you, at least to start. \\n\\n\\n\\nTips \\nAlways listen. \\nTalk to her frequently. The best approach is email. It gives you direct access to her head because you can be as intimate as you want and she can mull your words while you are not around. \\nKiss with your eyes -- establish that eye to eye contact and you will begin the intimacy process. \\nThis method works with men too except they don't like to talk as much. \\nDon't be creepy -- staring at the wrong times, seeming overly eager, or airing out your relationship past on the first date are all examples of the wrong way to seduce a woman. Relax, take it slow and be yourself (unless, of course, you are creepy). \\nBuild a \"buzz\" around yourself -- Women put a lot of stock in what their friends think of prospective suitors. If you want to date a particular girl, demonstrate your good qualities (e.g., sense of humor, good taste, charitable nature) around her friends. \\nThink before you speak. \\nWarnings \\nAlways use protection. \\nNever, ever have sex if a woman does not want to. Don't pressure her to do anything she doesn't want to do. Never hit a woman. \\n\\n--------------------------\n\nAnswer:",

Fireworks exploded over uptown Charlotte as jubilant fans gathered to celebrate the news. \"This is a dream come true for me and my partners and for the 10 million people in the Carolinas,\" said Carolina Panthers Owner/Founder Jerry Richardson, who became just the second former player to own an NFL team along with George Halas of the Chicago Bears. \\n\\nThe \"dream\" began on July 16, 1987 when Richardson met in Charlotte with a group of interested parties to discuss the feasibility of entering the multi-city competition for two NFL expansion franchises. On December 15, Richardson officially announced an NFL franchise bid for the Carolinas. \\n\\nOne of the first orders of business was to choose a stadium site. Locations in North and South Carolina were considered. On December 15, 1989, Richardson Sports selected a site in uptown Charlotte as the future home of a privately financed NFL stadium that would seat more than 70,000 fans. \\n\\nAcross the Carolinas, support for an NFL expansion team poured in at an unprecedented rate. U.S. Sens. Jesse Helms of North Carolina and Ernest Hollings of South Carolina lobbied NFL owners on the Carolinas behalf. Likewise, North Carolina Gov. Jim Martin and South Carolina Gov. Carroll Campbell formed a blue-ribbon committee of leading citizens in both states. Fans demonstrated their enthusiasm by selling out preseason games in Raleigh, NC in 1989, Chapel Hill, NC in 1990 and Columbia, SC in 1991. \\n\\nAt the League owners meeting on March 18, 1992, the NFL reduced the list of expansion candidate cities from eleven to seven with the Carolinas making the cut. Two months later, the NFL narrowed the list of expansion hopefuls to five communities \u2013 Baltimore, St. Louis, Memphis, Jacksonville and the Carolinas. \\n\\nHowever, on October 20, 1992, NFL owners decided to delay the expansion vote until the fall of 1993 because of a labor dispute between the League and the players. Fortunately, on January 6, 1993, the League and the players approved a new Collective Bargaining Agreement. On March 23, 1993, the expansion race officially resumed. \\n\\nOn June 3, Richardson Sports revealed its impressive plan to privately finance a 72,300-seat stadium from the sale of Permanent Seat Licenses, club seats and luxury boxes, beginning on July 1. A remarkable 15,000 pieces of mail from first-day orders were collected. By the end of the first day, all 8,314 club seats sold out and all 104 luxury suites were reserved and ultimately leased. First-day PSL orders totaled 41,632. \\n\\nFinally, on October 26, 1993, NFL owners unanimously selected Carolina as the 29th NFL franchise.\n\nAnswer:",

It's kind of like acting- if your girl plays the part of the sex kitten or the smoldering vixen, depending on what type of item it is- you're in for an INCREDIBLE night!

Eventually the decline becomes severe enough to interfere with daily activities and social relationships. \\nMany of the early symptoms of Alzheimer's disease are similar to the memory loss that occurs with normal aging, such as forgetting something you said earlier in the day. \\n\\nMore troubling symptoms may include: \\n\\nforgetting information you've just learned \\ndifficulty remembering the names of familiar objects \\nworsening confusion \\nchanges in behavior and personality \\na gradual inability to perform basic tasks \\nOf course, even symptoms characteristic of Alzheimer's disease may have other causes, such as a prescription medication. As you get older, your ability to metabolize medication changes. The dosage of a medication that was prescribed even a year ago may no longer be appropriate, resulting in symptoms such as confusion. \\n\\n\\nReaching a diagnosis\\nIf memory lapses or related symptoms begin to interfere with your daily life, consult your doctor. Often, input from loved ones and other close contacts can help the doctor determine the severity of your memory loss and other symptoms. \\nDiagnosing Alzheimer's disease can be stressful and time-consuming for both patients and their families. Proper diagnosis is the key to treatment and planning, however. And the sooner the better. Treatment is most effective when it begins in the early stages of the disease.\n\nAnswer:",

The CDC recommends the use of sexual prophylactics by anyone infected with hepatitis C or any other sexually transmissible disease, but common contact is not dangerous. While it should be kept in mind that there is no known mode of transmission for approximately 10% of cases, this should not be taken as a statement that it can be easily casually acquired. Routine precautions around blood, and avoiding the sharing of toothbrushes, razors, and other personal items should provide adequate protection.\\n\\n\\n\\nA number of agents can cause hepatitis, including infectious diseases, chemical poisons, drugs and alcohol. Hepatitis C is a contagious viral disease that leads to serious, permanent liver damage, and in many cases, death.\\n IV drug users represent the largest single risk group.  Sexual contact has been clearly identified as a means of transmitting hepatitis C.  Household contact with another household member that has hepatitis C has also been strongly implicated, and this, in combination with heterosexual exposure, is believed to be responsible for approximately 13% of all infections.  Around 2% of all cases of hepatitis C are thought to be contracted through the occupational risk (needle-stick injuries, blood spills, etc) involved with the health care profession.\\n\\nPrisoners have enormous incidence of infection - rates reported in some California prisons exceed 80%, with certain institutions reporting nearly 100% of their prisoners infected.\\n\\nSome skin piercing practices, notably tattooing, body piercing, and acupuncture, have contributed significantly to the spread of HCV, particularly in less industrialized nations. Tattooing in particular poses a serious risk. Even in the presence of good sterilization, studies have suggested that the ink used in tattooing can become contaminated and transmit the virus.\\n\\nCocaine users have an abnormally high risk of infection due to the fact that they frequently share snorting straws, which may have small amounts of blood-carrying mucous on them. \\n\\nLess obvious, specialized risk factors have been identified resulting from indirect exposures to blood - including manicures, shared toothbrushes and razors, and straight razors in barber shops.\\n\\nIn many surveys, about a third of people who are alcoholics are also infected with the HCV virus.\n\nAnswer:",

If there are emphasis on short term memories (e.g we think about it again), it might then be stored as long term memories. But why can't we remember anything from when we were very young?\nAnswer: Thats a very interesting question, and has been addressed at least to some point-It's clear, though we don't conciously remember events, that we do learn a great deal during this time, thus we \"remember' a huge amount- the process of walking, controlling your limbs, facial expressions, on and on and on, are all learned and remembered event from infanthood- What we don't seem to remember are events per se- It appears as if that portion of our learning is developmentally controlled, such that the limbic system filters much of the detail out in infancy- only later, when high-level socialization occurs, does the limbic system start to recognize details and allow them to reach long-term memory. Essentially, the brain and learning are very very tightly developmentally controlled, so that certain things are learned at certain times- biologically, the brain is wired such that the most critical learning, such as how to control the body, how to interact in the most general way with people, etc, are learned first, and everything else is weeded out.  It's probably critical that this occurs, else we would remember being a baby at the expense of not learning how to walk until we were in Junior high!\\nJust to address some things that were said before-we have an excellent memory as infants, and learn extremely quickly, but it is wired in a different way- There is also no evidence that events are stored at all, and thus no evidence that any of the infant memories can be \"recovered\" because they were not laid down to begin with.\n\nAnswer:",

Then he hit his 72nd and pushed the single-season home run record even further out of this world. On a night when the Giants' playoff hopes were dealt a knockout blow, Bonds struck back-to-back blows for the history books as he surpassed Mark McGwire's record 70 homer plateau set in 1998 and became the single-season home run king.

I have a LOT of fears and suffer from depression, anxiety and panic attacks, for which I'm on medication and under the care of a psychiatrist.\\n\\nOne of my main fears seems to be a fear of the dark. I haven't always been scared of the dark, this has only been over the past year or two and seems to be getting worse. I get really panicky when it's dark - I have to have a baby's night light in my room at night or I have a panic attack as soon as I put the light off. But there are other situations which can be embarrassing - the other night I was watching TV with my flatmate and he put the light off......I managed to cope OK until he switched off the TV and we were plunged into darkness, then I got really panicky and it was embarrassing to say the least.\\n\\nHow can I get over this? I feel like such a baby!\nAnswer: well firstly and most importantly stop feeling embarassed... i am 27 and afraid of the dark since i was a little girl... so? what? since it's not something that you have since childhood probably your generalised anxiety triggered it as well as other fears and phobias too. so feeling embarassed just makes you feel more anxious and therefore intesifies your fear of dark. leave a small light on in your room (like a baby's night light) and try one step at the time. For example try not to lock your door once or twice a week. Admit to your flatmates you are afraid of dark. When you ll do that you will find out they are afraid of other things too or maybe that they even share the fear of darkness. This will allow you to be less anxious and them being more considerate. Over the years I have realised that you have to manage your fears like climbing. Rule number one: admit the mountian is high! Rule number 2: never look at the top. Always focus on the little step you take. You ll reach the top before you know it...\n\nAnswer:",

If I manually set the IP, I can access the internet just not the other PC, and it shows as Unknown-00-06-5b-ad-c1-d1\\n\\nThanks.\nAnswer: yes you dont know what you are talking about #1\\n\\nand if you have PC1 into router 1 via wire\\nand PC2 into router 2 via wireless\\n\\nthey are obviously on two networks. plug PC1 into router 2 and make sure DHCP service is enabled on your router. I am assuming you are talking about those broadband routers that have DHCP service.\\n\\nupdate:\\n\\ntake away router 2 and put everything on router 1. You should be on the same network then, in order to get to that PC you  need to browse via IP unless you have a DNS server or if you are using an additional protocol other than IP\n\nAnswer:",

I get hit on alot at work ( we work together) and the men are very attractive, however no one knew we were dating. I am not interested in dating anyone else, however he has been seperated from his sons mother for 7 months and has yet to settle his affairs(ie seperate finances, sell the house, seperation agreement). He got jealous the other day and told everyone we were dating, I didn't want anyone to know until he settled his affairs.\\n\\nWhy is he so jealous, I have never cheated on anyone am very self confidant and independant. he withholds affection when he's angry at me(jealous) for something his mind has created.\nAnswer: Some guys want to be the center of attention for their girlfriends. Sounds like he needs more than you can give. Self confidence and independence can be intimidating for a guy too, so they may try to reinforce themselves by being controlling. Jealousy is a personal problem, there is a lack of confidence and trust.  I would be careful of this guy, hopefully he's not the violent type.\n\nAnswer:",

These thunderstorms often produce large hail, strong winds, and tornadoes. Tornadoes in the winter and early spring are often associated with strong, frontal systems that form in the Central States and move east. Occasionally, large outbreaks of tornadoes occur with this type of weather pattern. Several states may be affected by numerous severe thunderstorms and tornadoes.\\n \\nDuring the spring in the Central Plains, thunderstorms frequently develop along a \"dryline,\" which separates very warm, moist air to the east from hot, dry air to the west. Tornado-producing thunderstorms may form as the dryline moves east during the afternoon hours. \\nAlong the front range of the Rocky Mountains, in the Texas panhandle, and in the southern High Plains, thunderstorms frequently form as air near the ground flows \"upslope\" toward higher terrain. If other favorable conditions exist, these thunderstorms can produce tornadoes.\\n\\nTornadoes occasionally accompany tropical storms and hurricanes that move over land. Tornadoes are most common to the right and ahead of the path of the storm center as it comes onshore.\n\nAnswer:",

I watched the game there were no such things as unseen fouls.\\n\\n2 Do you know when it is apenalty ? when the handball done inside the penaltybox is deliberate. None of the handballs you say were deliberate.\\n\\n3 The linesman's flag was up , clearly, Frei was in a offside position. BUT when the ball was passed it touched a Korean player on the way . Thus it turned into a pass from a swiss player to a misspass from a korean. In case of a misspass the players offside position gets nullified, even if the whole swiss team was in offside & a misspass was made. this is the FIFA rule from 2003. The ref can overturn linesman's descision. He followed the rules & was right.\\n\\n\\nGood for Korea as they got a test of their own medicine. Remember how they cheated past Italy & Spain in 2002 ?

If it sprinkles, my teacher still made our class run- through the mud, too! That's why we have uniforms for p.e., so that when we wear our normal clothes, it wouldn't be all muddy and dirty- Though if it starts pouring, our teacher would tell us to go into the gym. I mean if the school is the cause of one's sickness because they got a cold from the rain or something, that's bad for the school/ ..Anyway, I think the rules vary from each school. I mean it can't be like extreme temperature- if it was snowing, or was like burning fire( eh, not really, we still stay out during the hot times)...but like yea.\n\nAnswer:",

There are too many different ways to do any one thing: programmers each adopt their own approach making team work difficult. Finally, Visual Studio is only a partial front end to asp.net - you can get part way towards writing a useful app in Visual Studio, but you almost always have to still do hand coding to get it to work. After several weeks of doing that, most developers discover it is faster to just hand-code in asp.net, and then all the acceleration you expected from a graphical front-end is gone. \\n\\nIn most cases, unless you have a pure Microsoft environment (and who does these days?), it is better to work with open tools and standards, and that means PHP, Perl, Python, MySQL, etc.\n\nAnswer:",

A digital video (DV) camcorder, for example, is a video camera that captures and stores images on a digital medium such as a DAT.....The history of digital video can be helpful in understanding the background of the technology that has had to evolve in order to produce quality reproductions of sound and images. The development of electronic reproduction of sound began at the end of the nineteenth century with the invention of the telephone. By the beginning of the twentieth century, the invention of the phonograph and radio had expanded the applications of electronic sound.\\n\\nAfter World War II, electronic motion pictures were found in people's homes through the invention of television. Television used analog technology to produce these pictures with sound. Analog technology requires information representing images and sound to be in a real-time continuous-scale electric signal between sources and receivers. Analog systems have become highly developed and widely used today.\\n\\nHowever, digital technology has also become widely used and a cost effective technology. Its roots also go back to the early nineteenth and early twentieth century. Digital technology is the representation of data by a fixed number of discrete points. Originally digital technology was developed for the purpose electronic computation. After World War II, digital computers were available, but they were expensive and difficult to use. This was true until the 1960's when solid state integrated circuits were developed. With this development, computing costs dropped, and computing speed and reliability increased, as well as the use of computers.\\n\\nWith the millions of televisions and VCRs in use today and the commonality of the personal computer, the merging of the controllability of personal computers with the quality images of television was inevitable. This merger can best be described as an evolution of computers and television technology which have united to produce interactive digital video.\n\nAnswer:",

Light is split up into the following colours with the first having the longest wavelenght and the last having the shortest. \\n\\nRed\\nOrange\\nYellow\\nGreen\\nBlue\\nIndico\\nViolet\\n\\nAn easy way to rememeber this is ROY G BIV (my year 12 geology teacher taught me that about 8 years ago)\\n\\nAs light moves through the atmosphere, most of the longer wavelengths are able to pass straight through. Little of the red, orange and yellow light is affected by the air. However, much of the shorter wavelength light is absorbed by the gas molecules in the atmosphere which is mainly nitrogen (78%) and oxygen (21%). The absorbed blue light is then scattered in all different directions. Since you see the blue light from everywhere overhead, the sky looks blue. \\n\\nOn Earth, the sun appears yellow. If you were out in space, or on the moon, the sun would look white. In space, there is no atmosphere to scatter the sun's light. On Earth, some of the shorter wavelength light (the blues and violets) are removed from the direct rays of the sun by scattering. The remaining colors together appear yellow. \\n\\nYou didnt ask about sunsets, but what the heck :)\\n\\nWhat happens during sunsets is that as the sun begins to go down, the light must travel farther through the atmosphere before it gets to you. More of the light is reflected and scattered. As less light reaches you directly, the sun appears less bright. The color of the sun itself appears to change, first to orange and then to red. This is because even more of the short wavelength blues and greens are now scattered. Only the longer wavelengths are left in the direct beam that reaches your eyes. \\n\\nThe second part of the your question is a lot easier. The sky is black simply  because of the lack of light from the sun going through the atmosphere. If there are no colours from the spectrum to get absorbed then the only thing that is left is the blackness of the sky.\n\nAnswer:",

It is really two programs-one on your computer (\"server\") and the other on the cracker's (\"client\"). This server runs automatically every time the computer is started. A Trojan program gives the cracker complete access to your computer. There are thousands of different Trojan programs.  Trojans need user intervention to install (the file needs to be opened) and do not self-replicate like viruses.\n\nAnswer:",

Up to a PO2 of 60 mm Hg, Hemoglobin is still substantially saturated with O2 and adequate amounts of O2 can be delivered to tissues and the brain. Also, when PO2 drops from 100 - 60, usually there is also increased PCO2 levels. So, ventilation is usually increased due to response of central and peripheral chemoreceptors to increasing PCO2 levels.\n\nAnswer:",

How many dollars did he carry in the begining?\nAnswer: He has $7\\n\\nHis money at thew start is X; after the first church, he has 2X (doubled) - 8 (donation); in the second church, (2X-8)*2 - 8; in the third (4X-24)*2 - 8.

I think thids person may be overweight.\nAnswer: (The height is missing from your question).If you go to www.calorie-count.com you can find a body-mass index calculator.  You type in the weight & height, and it gives you a number based on the ratio, and tells you if it's normal, under- or overweight.\\nFor an 11 yr old though, you probably shouldn't worry unless the child is obese, or borderline-obese.

And not just once: use different textbooks and sources, see photographs, so that you have the same facts hammered into your head from different perspectives. At least for me, repetition of a single text is boring and I end up in \"not recording\" mode. \\nI don't know if you are studying human anatomy only or general vertebrate anatomy; for the latter, the best way is to study the evolution and derivations of each muscles, because the basics are the same in all the groups. \\nThe names usually refer to their action in humans, so try to individualize those muscles in your own body. See what they do when you contract them.\\nGood luck!\n\nAnswer:",

My rent is 1800./month. I moved in in August 2005 and signed a one year lease. In February, 2006, the owners put it on the market.\\n\\nWhat are my rights AND responsibilities in terms of making this home available to prospective buyers?\\n\\nSo far, I have allowed showings without appointments three days a week within certain hours.\\n\\nI will be working from home for the summer, and cannot work with the threat of the doorbell ringing at any time. I have requested \"by appointment only\" and am getting significant flak from the listing agent.\\n\\nMy lease is up 7/31 at which point I'll be moving, but I need some advice for getting through the summer -- and to know whether if this all becomes to much, if I have the right to say \"ENOUGH.\" DO I HAVE TO LET PROSPECTIVE BUYERS IN THIS HOUSE, BY CA LAW? I need some advice as I have had no luck reading and interpreting CA code. Thanks.\nAnswer: The sale of the house has NO affect on your lease.  The buyer takes the house subject to the lease.\\n\\nThe lease should say something about the landlord's right to enter the premises.  While a showing is a valid purpose most states require advanced notice of intent to enter in writing.  There are also legal restrictions on the time of day i.e. not too early in the morning of after dinner at night.  The landlord's entry without advance notice is a lease violation.  You may be entitled to stop paying rent or terminate your tenancy as a result.\\n\\nThe bottom line is that you two are going to have to work it out.  If you are hostile during the showings the house will never sell, and thus the showings will never stop.\n\nAnswer:",

As the weight gain stopped and I controlled my appetite more consciously, I was able to lose a few pounds.  Even with exercise daily, I couldn't seem to lose it all.\\n\\nOnce I stopped Zyprexa, it was easier to lose the weight.  I'd recommend diet and exercise as the easiest way to lose the weight.

Smug Christians always say that atheists immediately turn to God at the first sign of adversity, but this climber found his atheist beliefs were stronger than ever. In fact, he argues that had he been a believer, he would have accepted events as \"God's will\", and just made his peace and waited either for a miracle rescue, or to die and join God in heaven. Instead, BECAUSE he was an atheist, he lowered himself further into the pitch black crevice. He dragged his broken leg behind him for days, without water, climbing over boulders, etc., and finally made it back to camp. Ironically, the non-atheist at the camp heard him crying for help, thought he was a ghost, and refused to leave the tent to help.  So, my question is, wouldn't a Christian just accepted events, stayed put, prayed and died?\nAnswer: If he's an athiest how would he know what he would do as a believer??\n\nAnswer:",

I didn't write that!\"\\n\\nUnfortunately, since having a Christ complex is automatically assumed to be prime evidence of psychosis and thinking you're a prophet usually convinces the government of every industrialized country, no matter which one you happen to be in, you're a cult leader who has to be stopped for the social good, any prophet that shows back up at this point to illuminate the word of God will either be labeled a lunatic and locked up in a teeny padded room with a guy knitting a sweater that doesn't exist and another one who thinks he's Napoleon, or else tear-gassed, and either shot on the scene or put on trial and hauled off to prison for the rest of his or her life.\\n\\nPlus, you do have to contend with the pesky fact the Bible says anyone who tries to tell you they know the word of God and that it's somehow different than the Bible is a false prophet trying to lead you to Hell and they'll be cropping up all over the place, while the only guy who can really explain it to you will only show up five minutes after the world ends... so chances are everyone who needs to listen will be busy sticking their fingers in their ears, screaming \"No, NO!  NOT LISTENING, YOU WHORE OF BABYLON!  LA LA LA LA LA!!! NOT LISTENING!!!\"\\n\\nSo who knows, could've been tons of them sent down by God to explain things to us, and we could've just ignored them all.\\n\\nP.S.-- Don't believe me?

I am a little apprehensive about asking him too many questions about his religion because I don't want to get wrapped up in a religious discussion with him without knowing a little more about his beliefs.  Also, I'm interested in knowing more about their beliefs and customs so that I don't accidentally do or say anything offensive when I am in his home.  Can anyone give me a quick rundown on what I might need to know about the Mormons in order better understand the background of my girlfriend's family?  By the way....although she was raised in this family, my girlfriend is not a practicing Mormon.  I know very little about Mormons and simply wish to gain a little knowledge in order to practice good \"etiquett\" when interacting with her father.  Thanks for any info you guys can help me with.\nAnswer: Overall, they are nice people, and more respectful and respectable than the evangelical christians I know.  I would not recommend getting into a dating relationship with one of them, though.  They have been told that they need to be with a mormon.  Some of them say that they do not mind being with a nonmormon, but as the relationship gets more serious, they tend to freak out.  Eventually it comes down to the talk where the mormon says \"it doesn't feel right\".  This means they were just playin' and now they are afraid they are going to have to reap the consequences (give up the possibility of getting married in the temple).  I live in Utah, and I shiver in dread everytime one of my non-LDS friends says they are dating a member of the church.  And it always ends the exact same way.  It's like there is a script on how to date non-mormons, and people who are not mormons are not as valuable in Heavenly Father's eyes or something.\\n\\nBest of luck to you.  I sincerely hope for your sake that she really does not believe in her church.  Even if she is inactive but still believes, you are headed for heartbreak.\\n\\nOh, and if you want to learn about the religion from someone that believes, look at www.lds.org  This is a website that is put out by the LDS church.  It is pretty informative.\n\nAnswer:",

Do you think it exists in western society?\nAnswer: White privilege means the attitude of a certain group of people in the Caucasian race that go through life without recognizing that they have an air of entitlement about them as they move through life.  A perfect example:  My son and I were at a mall,  he opened the door for me and two Caucasian women, talking to each other, pushed through in front of me, without acknowledging him.  He looked at me and just shook his head.  Another time, a man walked up as I was dealing with a customer service agent in a Cingular store and proceeded to tell the agent his issue.  He became very rude when I explained that I was not only there conducting business as he walked up, but that he needed to get in line behind the other 15 people that he had stepped in front of.  He proceeded to tell me how out of line I was and that he was 'just' asking the agent one or two questions.  I explained to him a little more forcefully that he was not the only one with questions, and needed to wait his turn.  He was so out done he actually left the store.  I've experienced this type of behavior over 50 years in various states, so these are not isolated incidents.\\n\\nThis is not about slavery or being \"owed a living by the government\".  This is about being treated as a piece of the woodwork, about people talking about you while you are in the room as though you are not in the room saying things that are offensive and ignorant.  This is about people treating you as though you are invisible which you are to them, stepping in front of you in line, demanding to be served first in a restaurant because their time is more important than yours, walking into you and not saying excuse me but saying excuse me to the white woman behind you that they did the same thing to.  Yes, it is rude, but it is also an attitude of I am better than you and I deserve what I get because I was born to it and I don't give it a second thought.  It's about bringing up slavery, when no one was even mentioning  or thinking of slavery.\n\nAnswer:",

We used it as a healing, helping retreat for parkie people.  Now we can no longer have it.  It is not the same as having conference talks thru instant messenger.  We need the closeness and feeling of a family of parkie people we had with the private chat room on yahoo.  Can someone please help me....we will pay to have a chatroom constructed just as the one we had on yahoo OR even get back the chat section of our old yahoo chat room.  http://health.groups.yahoo.com/group/parkiejam.

My cousin got her Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery in India. She has lost more than 65 lbs in 5 months and is very happy with the results. The price for obesity surgery is very less in India. My cousin just paid 25% of the cost she was quoted in America. She got her surgery from a company called Forerunners Healthcare.\\n\\nForerunners Healthcare is very famous in India. I read a lot about them in the Newspapers and magazines. I have read a lot of their patient stories also. They arrange financing for USA, Canadian, UK and other international patients who plan to have surgery abroad for low cost, as bariatric surgery and weight loss surgery is not covered by insurance. They also have photos pasted of their International patients. You can checkout their website. There are huge cost savings. As a doctor I personally believe that your Obesity surgery can be easily handled in India, as the quality of healthcare available In India is simply best in the world. The surgeons are USA/UK trained and facilities are 5 star.\\n\\nhttp://www.forerunnershealthcare.com\\nHope this helps.\n\nAnswer:",

A typical person can handle about 5 g (50 m/s\u00b2) before this occurs, but through the combination of special g-suits and efforts to strain muscles \u2014both of which act to force blood back into the brain\u2014 modern pilots can typically handle 9 g (90 m/s\u00b2) sustained (for a period of time) or more. Resistance to \"negative\" or upward gees which drive blood to the head, is much less. This limit is typically in the -2 to -3 g (-20 to -30 m/s\u00b2) range. The vision goes red and is also referred to as a \"red-out\". This is probably due to capillaries in the eyes bursting under the increased blood pressure. Humans can survive about 20 to 40 g instantaneously (for a very short period of time). Any exposure to around 100 g or more, even if momentary, is likely to be lethal.\n\nAnswer:",

What's a good one for this...?\nQuestion: My girlfriend just got some new friends. I was trying to tell her they are the kind of people that aren't really friends. They are the kind of people that just want to have fun with you. They don't really care about your problems or sympatheize with you. All she does with them is party. I can already see them changing her. She is cussing more, drinking too much, and she tried smoking a cigarette and she doesn't even smoke. It seems like she is loosing some of her morals too. The only true friends she probably has moved away a long time ago and has a busy life so she almost never gets to talk with her. She considers them all the same. I was looking for a movie that shows what friends like this really are like, how they are nothing but trouble and will only bring you down. Maybe just a movie that has this in it and not one that is only about this. Or how can I get her to see what these people are really like???\nAnswer: hey do you think that movie your looking for will change her?\n\nAnswer:",

How are you doing medically (and otherwise)? I was with the 1st Cav, 184th Chem Platoon, Phuoc Vinh, Viet Nam 70-71. Then up with the Americal up on the DMZ. Welcome home.\nAnswer: My father manufactured the active ingredient in agent orange,(C-5,6), at Hooker Chemical's Montague Michigan plant for the duration of the Vietnam War. The process was so volatile and so toxic that it had to be manufactured on a seven story wall-less superstructure in the middle of a 160 acre field. All of the production was then loaded on railway tankcars for shippment to Dow Chemical of Midland Mi.for addition of solvents and packaging for shipment to the military. At the close of the war, the superstructure was dismantled, and it, and all associated equipment, tools etc. were buried in a huge clay lined disposal pit on the site. The site remains a Toxic hot spot to this day and all of the surrounding neighborhood has water piped into them as the groundwater is highly contaminated. From '82-'93 my father ran a chlorine plant's maintainence department on the persian gulf, about 25 kliks from Kuwait City in Saudi. In 1997 he fell ill with the small cell cancer that has become consistent, though unrecognized by our government, as due to exposure to AO or its components. I know this as I was a service officer for the Am Legion Post here in my  town, and have seen the wreckage that this stuff left in its wake. I am an Non Combatant, US Navy, Vietnam Era vet, ( Commonly refferred to as a \"rear echelon puke\" ), who salutes and thanks you for your service. Hope you are well, and look forward to your Photo posts as you are quite knowledgeable on the subject. God Bless, Jed\n\nAnswer:",

If a gay couple is in love, they deserve every right a hetero couple has. Marriage rights are exactly that, rights. And ever American is entitled to them. Some liberals even buy the conservative rhetoric against gay marriage. A common conservative tactic against liberal proposals is to convince the public that it would be  devastating financially. Similar arguments were made about abolishing slavery, workers unions, raising the minimum wage, and environmental protections. Gays represent about 5% of the population. Considering the number of hetero couples that get married and divorced, and the overall makeup of the economy, including the hundreds of billions spent on wars, corporate welfare, social programs, and numerous other government programs, the impact would be minimal and the economy would adjust without serious consequences.\\n\\nIt has more to do with religous idealogy and bigotry - they often go hand in hand. It's not only the idea of a gay couple being together they don't like, or the pretense that it would somehow cheapen their marriage. Along with marriage rights they would have the right to adopt, which also goes against their personal/religous beliefs.\n\nAnswer:",

It's so annoying! When I get my period, I use tampons and tampons only. But, it always leaks and I always have these stupid stains. I'm going on vacation to Washington DC, and I think I'll get it there. Aside from the point that it'll ruin my vacation, I'm also mad because I'm sharing a suite with my mom, my  mom's friend, and my aunt & cousin. What do I do?\nAnswer: To avoid stains you should put on panty liners in your panties while you wear tampons then once it gets full you can change them like you would a regular pad. You should never wear tampons when you are sleeping. You could forget you have it on in the morning or you could have more of a leakage while you're sleep with it on. Always wear pads while you are sleeping. It shouldn't be that bad when you go on your vacation just as long as you take control of your period and make sure that you are doing the right stuff and using the right stuff.

Can you go back to using an antenna instead of cable or satellite.\\n\\nDo you and your spouse, if you have one, both need cell phones.  Do you both really talk enough (like over 200 minutes a month) to justify your monthly cell phone plan?  Prepaid plans are available for 10 cents a minute.  Check out T-Mobile.  If you pay $100 in advance, those 1000 minutes are good for 1-year, vs. $35 or so monthly bill that most people don't even use half the minutes available.\\n\\nDo you need call waiting and caller ID on your phone?  Dump'em.  If you are paying more than 3.9 cents per minute for domestic long distance, you are getting hosed.  Americom offers that with no monthly charges and no monthly minimum usage requirements.\\n\\nShop your auto insurance.  Especially check out Costco if you are a member.  Last year I shopped around for auto insurance.  Everyone gave me higher prices than what I was already paying, except Costco.  They offered me the same coverage for $500 less per year.\\n\\nDo this with every bill that comes in.  Ask yourself if you really need that service, at that level.  Is there a cheaper alternative?  Can I pare back on the service plan?\\n\\nAs for your car or truck.  Buy them lightly used with low miles, and save a ton.  Then drive it 8 to 10 years and save even more.  I haven't had a car payment in 3 years and it feels great! My car is 8 years old and it still drives wonderfully.  Just give it a professional detailing every now and then for that new car feel!\\n\\nThere's a great book by a radio consumer advocate named Clark Howard.  It's called \"Get Clark Smart: The Ultimate Guide to Getting Rich from America's Money-Saving Expert.\"  This book is full of wise advice on how to save, spend and invest your money.  It is not a get rich quick book.\\n\\nYou'll be amazed by how much money you can save, by finding better and cheaper alternatives, or doing without services you rarely use.\n\nAnswer:",

Over 700 types of igneous rocks have been described, most of them formed beneath the surface of the Earth's crust. The word \"igneous\" is derived from the Latin ignis, meaning \"fire\".\\n\\nIgneous rock are classified according to mode of occurrence, texture, chemical composition, and the geometry of the igneous body.\\n\\nIgneous rocks make up 95% of the Earth's upper crust.\n\nAnswer:",

I've never heard of that before, but May 1 is Labour Day in many countries.  My grandpa who lived to a 100 said that May 1 was a very bad day and that lots of people died on that day, but he never explained.\nAnswer: This is the festival of Beltane, originally celebrated in the religions of the indigious peoples of nothern Europe.\\nIt is a festival in which one lights a fire to celebrate the coming of the summer and fertility of the earth.\\nHistorically this was a good time for the Christian Inquisitors to find and execute those who followed the old gods - this is probably where the association with death comes from.  Beltane was not a festival associated with major human sacrifces - these festivals would have occured in mid-winter (about the last week of December).\\nBeltane is also the maypole festival.

The sheets are usually in letter or A4 size, and you have a choice of the size of the label and thus the number of labels that fit in a sheet. \\n\\nSome label manufacturers have a template (like a sample page with the lines matching the label sheet) that you can download from their website (look up the product code). Otherwise you can just type out your addresses in any word document and just try to match the spacing. Print a test page on plain paper first. \\n\\nThe other option is to get a label sheet that is A4 or letter size, meaning there are no smaller stickers cut into it. Then you just print normally and then cut it up with a pair of scissors. \\n\\nSo in other words, no need for special software at all, just any normal word program will do.\n\nAnswer:",

What i did was first start the laptop in safe mode, then go to msconfig and uncheck most of the start up programs.  restart in safe mode again and run disk cleanup, defrag, sfc, and scandisk.  Restart and see if you can get on the internet and run windows update.  I had to try several times since it locked up during windows update.  If you are still locking up go to control panel system and advanced and performance and select the Adjust for best performance then apply and Ok and restart again.  Still locking up open event viewer and see if you have any red errors then post them here or if you have another pc look them up on the MS site.  I think the video card maybe the problem.  I also went to the dell site and downloaded the dell helper utility.  Hope this helps.\\nHenry\n\nAnswer:",

There are several theories about the origin of the seas, but no single theory explains all aspects of this puzzle. Many earth scientists agree with the hypothesis that both the atmosphere and the oceans have accumulated gradually through geologic time from some process of \"degassing\" of the Earth's interior. According to this theory, the ocean had its origin from the prolonged escape of water vapor and other gases from the molten igneous rocks of the Earth to the clouds surrounding the cooling Earth. After the Earth's surface had cooled to a temperature below the boiling point of water, rain began to fall and continued to fall for centuries. As the water drained into the great hollows in the Earth's surface, the primeval ocean came into existence. The forces of gravity prevented the water from leaving the planet.\\n       All water, even rain water, contains dissolved chemicals which scientists call \"salts.\" But not all water tastes salty. Water is fresh or salty according to individual judgment, and in making this decision man is more convinced by his sense of taste than by a laboratory test. It is one's taste buds that accept one water and reject another.\\nOcean water is indeed a complex solution of mineral salts and of decayed biologic matter that results from the teeming life in the seas. Most of the ocean's salts were derived from gradual processes such the breaking up of the cooled igneous rocks of the Earth's crust by weathering and erosion, the wearing down of mountains, and the dissolving action of rains and streams which transported their mineral washings to the sea. Some of the ocean's salts have been dissolved from rocks and sediments below its floor. Other sources of salts include the solid and gaseous materials that escaped from the Earth's crust through volcanic vents or that originated in the atmosphere.\n\nAnswer:",

When it flowers, the growing tip of the shoot becomes a flowering stem when then supports the fruits. Since the growing part of the shoot can no longer grow (because it was converted into a flowering shoot) the whole shoot dies off after the fruit has been set. The plant itself is mostly underground; it doesn't die but produces more shoots (more \"trees\").\n\nAnswer:",

Example: the 5 year average P/E range for most banks has been 12-28. However, stocks in the retail sales industry (Pet Smart, Best Buy, etc.) have had an average 24-44 P/E multiple over this same period even though their margins are lower.\nAnswer: Hi Dave,\\n\\nI saved an article a while back that addressed this same question. Basically it has to do with the required reserves that banks must have because they take your deposits (and due to the nature of the business).  The article is below but is missing the related tables that it references.  Email me at bimmayute1@yahoo.com and I'll send you the article (word doc).\\n\\nNicholas\\nnsmconsulting.net\\n\\n\\n\\nBy Vitaliy Katsenelson, CFA\\n02/10/2006 \\nInvesting in the stock market is a never-ending learning experience. That's what makes it so appealing and intellectually stimulating. And I inadvertently had one of those live-and-learn experiences just the other day. \\nIn my piece on Lloyds TSB(NYSE: LYG), I wrote that banks usually trade at lower price-to-earnings ratios to the market because they are considered riskier investments as a result of their high use of debt. That line caught the eye of Foolish financial editor Joey Khattab, who asked writers Stephen Simpson and Nate Parmelee whether they agreed with my logic. Both disagreed. They argued that larger banks have lower P/Es generally because they are perceived to have a slower or more limited growth potential. \\nAt first, I thought there might be a conspiracy of Fools at work against me! So I asked several investment professionals for their opinion. And to my amazement, they all agreed with the Fools. \\nSo I looked at some larger banks to see whether they had been slow growers in the past, and I couldn't reach that conclusion. Many of these banks, in fact, had achieved very respectable earnings growth and paid above-average dividends in the process. I then looked at expectations for future earnings growth, and they appeared not to be below average, either. With the exception of Fifth Third(Nasdaq: FITB), which Wall Street once loved to love and now loves to hate, the rest of the pack was trading at a substantial discount to the market and still are. \\nInstitution 10-Year Avg. EPS Growth Rate Median 10-Year P/E Current Dividend Proj. EPS Growth \\nCitigroup18.6% 15.3 3.8% 10% \\nU.S.Bancorp(NYSE: USB)\\n17.5% 14.3 4.5% 10% \\nFifth Third15.8% 22.7 4.1% 10% \\nWells Fargo(NYSE: WFC)\\n12.8% 15.6 3.4% 11% \\nBank of America(NYSE: BAC)\\n9.3% 13.4 4.5% 9% \\nAmsouth8.7% 12.8 3.7% 8% \\nRegions Financial(NYSE: RF)\\n4.6% 13.7 4.0% 8% \\nWachovia(1.6%) 13.6 3.9% 10% \\nJPMorgan Chase(NYSE: JPM)\\n(2.7%) 15.0 3.6% 10% \\n\\nThe answer must be more complex than just the growth rates. I believe the answer to banks' lower P/Es lies in the following four factors. \\n1. Cyclicality \\nThe banking business is closely tied to the health of the economy. As the economy expands, demand for loans increases and bad debt declines -- a combination that improves banks' profitability. In a contracting economy, of course, the reverse takes place. \\nBecause investors pay up for predictability, they rarely pay a full market multiple for the volatility that comes with cyclical companies. Cyclical heavy-industrial companies like Caterpillar and Ingersoll Rand, for example, usually trade below the market P/E just as a many banks do. \\n2. Financial leverage \\nWe have not had a bank crisis in the U.S. for a while, so most investors have forgotten just how risky banks can be. But as Warren Buffett has said, by the time you find out a bank has a problem, it will be too late. The equity at most banks stands at meager 6%-10% of total assets, so when a bank does make a mistake, its high leverage amplifies the problem. \\n3. Interest rate volatility \\nBanks are subject to the risks that come with changing interest rates. They prosper when the difference between long-term and short-term rates -- in other words, the interest rate spread -- is high. However, when that spread narrows, it becomes increasingly difficult for banks to make any money. Many banks have addressed the problem by boosting their fee businesses. For example, fees account for a full 46% of U.S. Bancorp's income, thereby making the com\n\nAnswer:",

Even the USSR was democratic in the truest sense and meaning of the word, the people could vote, problem was there was only one person they could vote for.\\n\\nOil has NOTHING to do with the war in IRAQ. I won't even get into why but the war would be in Saudi Arabia where the oil reserves are over twice the size of Iraq.\\nWe need to look back in history to see what has happened and the future looks bright for IRAQ. Success in Central America, Liberia, Korea, the new Russia, the slavic regions, and others have formed some type of democracy.\\n\\nThe \"democracy\" that other countries enjoy are definately not the same as ours, but even a Monarchy like Morocco has a democratic government.\\n\\nSuccess in IRAQ will indeed depend on whether democracy becomes the new form of government when America finally does pull out or if there will be political chaos and insergency.\\n\\nTime will only tell.\\n\\nTo correct a couple of the other writers above me...\\n\\nThe United States is NOT a democratic country, it is a Federal Republic. If indeed we were a true democracy Gore would be president not George Bush (Gore won more of the popular vote but less of the electoral vote). So to say the US is the most democratic country in the world is absurd. Correct me if I am wrong but there is no country in the world that is truely democratic.\n\nAnswer:",

Start, Run there is a list of recent commands.?\nQuestion: Let me explain: Click on Start, & then Run.  How do I get rid of or clear the list of recent commands I entered (ie. msconfig, regedit)?  \\n\\nIn XP Pro there is something called Group Policy.  It allows you to prevent access to specific programs, removes access to certain things from the Start menu (Control Panel, Windows Explorer, etc.), prevents changing Internet settings, etc.\\n\\nMany people will have access to this computer, so I'm trying to prevent/remove access to many functions on the computer to prevent people from not using the computer as intended.  But I also want to be able to log in as an Admin & have a normal computer.\\n\\nWhen people click on Start there will not be much there, because I have either prevented access or hidden the Icons.  Most people aren't going to know how to undo these changes, unless they know about Group Policy.  The only normal way a person might figure it out would be to click on Run & choose Group Policy from the dropdown list & undo my changes.\nAnswer: I don't know if this includes the \"Run\" command, but you can give it a try:\\n\\nRight-click Start, and choose Properties.  Make sure the \"Classic Start menu\" radio button is selected, then click Customize.  Click the \"Clear\" button, and I think that should clear your list.\n\nAnswer:",

Any advice on how to help him deal with it? I just usually listen to what he has to say, but i dont ever know what to say to make things better for the moment.\nAnswer: The best thing you can do is just listen.  The fact that he is talking to you about this is a great complement to you indicating that the trusts you and feels that you will understand.\\n\\nIf he appears to be having problems dealing with these events or is having nightmares, stress, fears, etc then he should be evaluated for PTSD.  Do not assume that the has PTSD just because he was in Iraq but if he is showing signs of distress find a local 'Veteran's Outreach Center' and talk him into going there.  Here he can be evaluated by a psychologist experienced in Combat PTSD and he can get assistance if he needs it.\\n\\nIf he needs assistance but does not want to go to the vet center - at least have him email me.\n\nAnswer:",

My legal marriage was taken away by two state's courts.  I mourned.  Thousands of couples would celebrate if the amendments didn't pass; that, I get.\\n\\nBut why would people for it celebrate?  Or, as a woman on one of my debate lists did, say \"Yippee\" about it?\\n\\nWhat, exactly, are they celebrating, and why?\\n\\nI am powerfully curious.  I'm not sure I'll like the answers, but I'm pressing the buttons anyhow.\nAnswer: This question is very difficult. I believe same sex couples should have some status that provides for all the benefits afforded to married hetero couples. \\nTo me it is the word marriage that stops everyone.No need to rehash all the reasons,  ie procreation and so forth. \\nFor the couples it is a marriage in their eyes, and so should it be, requiring a legal dissolution should the union break up.\\n\\nThe whole thing would be what name to give the ceremony that legally joins these two. Heteros do not want to call it a marriage, gays do. Is it really so important that word is used if there were a legal commitment ceremony with all the trimmings and benefits?\n\nAnswer:",

I like mens clothes. My hair is short cuz it looks better that way and is easier to manage. My voice is deep by nature and my physical characteristics are genetic, I look like my father. \\n\\nI do NOT want to be a man tho. I would never even consider \"the operation\".

It's very common, and you'll see it happen a lot as you go through chemistry. In this reaction, it donates a hydrogen to produce OH-, which reaction with Na+ to produce NaOH, but then HCO3 forms CO2, meaning that you now have OH- from the HCO3 floating around, and H+ from the original H2O floating around, and they form an ionic bond to create H2O.\n\nAnswer:",

Don't submit a resume that says you want an interesting job and leave it to the employer to decide where to put you. He or she will drop your resume in the garbage. You need a sentence like you want to find a sales job where you can use your strong interpersonal skills for example. Most people get their jobs from people they know so talk to people you know and let them know you are looking for work. You can also get the telephone book and call places you would like to work. For example, if you want to do mortgages, go to the yellow pages and call mortgage companies and get the name of the person to fax or mail your resume to.\n\nAnswer:",

Whether you are or not (CA and CO) they are all basically the same. You either have to be a first time homebuyer or not have home ownership interest with in the last three years. The only exceptions to this is 1) if you are purchasing with in a census targeted location with in the state 2) Recently divorced and can produce documentation of the separation. \\n\\nOther areas that you have to be concerned is that there are income and sales price limits for specific locations based on township and/or targeted census locations. \\n\\nThere is a lot more information, but I am not going to post it, but you can either email me if you have any more questions.

It took many years of improvements in agricultural technology before that could happen. \\n\\nThe most useful thing to the serfs was the invention of metal plows. Before that they used a wooden scratch plow. This was designed for tilling soil in the Mediterranean region but was horrible for tilling the hard soil further north. When they were able to make deeper furrows they were able to plant their crops deeper which protected them from the elements resulting in a greater crop yield. \\n\\nAnother important invention was the creation of a new kind of harness that allowed them to work the land with horses instead of oxen. The old design cut off too much of the horse's windpipe. Naturally, a suffocating horse isn't a good worker. So they used oxen which didn't suffocate but were slow and difficult to work with. With the new harness they could use faster horses and work more of the land.\n\nAnswer:",

He wrote songs and performed on over 20 CDB albums, winning a grammy for \"The Devil Went Down To Georgia.\" Tom has played with countless other artists, and his fiery guitar work is always recognizable. \\n\\nThe Crosstown Allstars are not only a sought after rhythm section, but regularly appear around the Atlanta area as a stand alone act. Their ability to deliver honest, heart-felt blues, southern rock, classic R&B and jazz make them a definite crowd pleaser. The band members have played with such diverse acts as Cheap Trick, John Lee Hooker, Mountain, Little Feat, Georgia Satellites, Jaimoe, Tinsley Ellis, Albert Collins, Luther Ingram, Roy Buchanan and the Marshall Tucker Band. \\n\\nMichael Buffalo Smith, Editor of Gritz Magazine who recently saw the band perform, writes, \"Tommy Crain and The Crosstown Allstars took the stage next, and simply burned on a 45-minute set of original blues rock. Crain has truly put together an amazing band, recorded an equally amazing album, and is sounding better than ever.\"\\n\\n\"Give It To Ya,\" is the first studio effort from this exciting band. Recorded in late 2004/early 2005, the CD highlights the bands diversity and musicianship. A live CD from the band is also available.\n\nAnswer:",

( seriously help.) NOT A MENTAL PROBLEM ITS A RELATIONSHIP PROBLEM!?\nQuestion: Ok Here's The Story. Im not giving u my age. Im Older Than Elementary and Younger than 10th Grade. Anywho My Boyfriend. His Ex is My best friend. She Still Likes Him. He hates her. That  \"Ex Boyfriend \" Is Now my boyfriend. (his name is John) (My best friend's name is Haley)\\nJohn Hates Haley. Haley is in luv wit him. I LOVE JOHN. and haley is going out with a boy she doesnt even like and shes doing that to make John jealous. She Thinks He Still likes her. Haley Thinks He is going out with me 2 make her jealous. ME and John are fine we love each other. But Haley, (my now x-best friend) likes him still. Me and John have been going out for a month and a week. And i dont want us 2 end. Please Give Me advice 2 get rid of Haley. (without any murder please) Give Me advice to help out please!\nAnswer: Wow.  Well, there is nothing you can really do to control the outcome of this situation, that depends on who truly has feelings for who.  I think John probably really likes you and not Haley, because if he still liked Haley he would probably be already trying to get back together with her by now.  I think Haley just wants to believe he still likes her because she likes him, and people can make themselves belief what they really want to believe.  \\n\\nIt is kind of disturbing that you would date your friend's ex especially when you know she still likes him.  Maybe you two aren't truly friends?  I guess you can just stop hanging out with Haley.  And she can't come between you and John if John truly likes you and not her, right?\\n\\nSo I guess just tell Haley that you think she is kind of obsessed with John, and John is with you now, and you are sorry but you really have feelings for John, so you think it's best if you and she don't hang out for awhile.  This will hurt her, but I guess she needs to get the message that John is taken now, and she needs to back off.\n\nAnswer:",

Maybe part of you wants to give him a chance even though \"he doesn't fit into the mold of a man I would consider dating\". Sometimes, it's a good idea to do something different, open doors rather than close doors, be open to new opportunities. Anyway, it's always your life to do whatever you think is best for you. Good Luck!\n\nAnswer:",

What is considered hirsutism in one culture may be considered typical in another. For example, women from the Mediterranean and the Indian subcontinent have more facial and body hair than do women from East Asia, sub-Saharan Africa, and northern Europe.\\n\\nYou can help your body oppose androgen dominance in a number of ways.\\n\\nProgesterone is the one hormone in a woman's body that modulates other hormones helping to restore balance. It's certainly proving to be a major player in the successful treatment of PCOS. Progesterone supplementation might, therefore, be a good starting point.\\n\\nI would certainly suggest women pay particular attention to diet and nutrition, avoid all refined carbohydrates and sugars, introduce a premium phytoestrogen-vitamin-mineral formulation, incorporate a essential fatty acid supplement, get plenty of exercise, drink lots of filtered water, reduce weight (if need be), learn to manage your stress levels, and rest up.\\n\\nAnd source yourself a healthcare professional who's familiar with salivary hormone profiles and prescribing human-identical hormone replacement therapy.\n\nAnswer:",

I noticed that strange people are around when I park my car at Public places.  The people wait untill I go into my place of employment or other public places,video store,grocery store,mall etc.  The car is caring something that makes it feel heavy.  I have checked everyplace and ask others to help in finding whatever it may be.  I have weighed my car at the local dump and it sometimes does have extra weight and it varies.  I know this sounds crazy but what would someone do besides let it keep happening.  It gets put onto my car most weekends and other days during the week.

If so, why not bring it to the US?  If not, what are we bringing?\nAnswer: We do live in a republic.  A democracy (means rule by the people in latin) is when the people vote on each and every issue that comes up.  A 'rep'ublic (based on the same word as 'rep'resentative in latin) is when we elect representatives (president, representative, senator, governor, legislator, and so on) to represent us on each of these issues.\\n\\nNow I do agree with your argument about bringing it to the US.  In the 2004 election only 28% of population voted, as compared to the 70% in Israel, the 78% in Iraq when they first voted.  In fact, with the exception of Britain and France, nearly every democratic country in the world is above 60%.  But the United States, England, and France all show in the low 20's.  Not exactly people ruling, nor even representatives of the population ruling.\n\nAnswer:",

I'm absolutely terrified/disgusted by sex.  And not like a virgin scared of sex.  I have had sex twice but both times while extremely drunk.  I refuse to do anything sexual when I'm sober or aware of what's going on.  Just to clarify I wasn't raped or anything so it wasn't guys taking advantage of me when I was drunk.  It absolutely terrifies me to even think about sex.  Also it's disgusting to me and really just grosses me out.  Also I'm never horny/aroused at all even if I see a sex scene or anything like that.  IS there a reason for this?  What is this called?  What can I do about it?  Is this normal at all??\nAnswer: Don't have sex if you are not enjoying it. Don't get drunk just to have sex.\\n\\nIt might be that you have some sort of aversive feelings, maybe a phobia. It is not typical. I suggest you go to a reputable therapist and talk about this.

They have brainwashed their brother into not calling and will not let him see his sisters or brother to spend time with them after 6 years of being together.

But do the Siblings have a right to fight in Court for visitation also, that is the question???\nAnswer: In most states they are concerned about \"The good of the child\" If your children are upset about not seeing their brother you should check with a lawyer.

I just have questions of those who worship other cources of god such as, Allah, Buddah, etc. Are they going to hell? Who's to say? I  mean, for those people with good hearts, philantropy and altruism, humanity, meditation and respect for this earth at the fore front everyting they do. Will they go to hell if they don't accept Jesus? I want to cry this hurts so bad.. The not knowing ya know?  I am really trying to find ansers. We just started going to a Christian church and am moved every time. But when they say Jesus is the only way, or you go to hell, it scares me and makes me feel guilty when I sometimes feel my worship is to God in general. If others who follow different faiths continue, will they go to hell?Then others talk of reincarnation, and past lives, does Jesus promote that way of thinking?? The guilt of not knowing.. thanks..\nAnswer: Jesus is God. Christians who say otherwise either do not know the fundamentals of the faith, are apostate, or are heretics. The Apostle's and Nicene Creeds both affirm this doctrine, and the biblical evidence is overwhelming.\\n\\nJesus said of Himself that He was God. He applied the name of God, \"I AM,\" to Himself in several passages. Here's a few examples: Matthew 14:27, Mark 6:50, Mark 13:6, Luke 21:8, John 4:26, John 6:20, John 8:24, 28, 58, and John 13:19. (Some English translations have mistranslated the words \"I am\" to \"It is I,\" or \"I am He.\")\\n\\nJesus received worship, which is reserved only for God:\\n\\n\"Then the men in the boat began to worship Jesus, saying, \"You certainly are the Son of God!\" (Matthew 14:33)\\n\\n\"Suddenly Jesus met them and said, \"Greetings!\" They went up to him, took hold of his feet, and worshiped him.\" (Matthew 28:9)\\n\\n\"They worshiped him and returned to Jerusalem with great joy.\" (Luke 24:52)\\n\\n\"He said, \"Lord, I do believe,\" and worshiped him.\" (John 9:38)\\n\\nFurther, the god of Muhammad is not the Father of Jesus. The Qur'an states rather clearly, \"Proclaim: Allah is One. Allah is Eternal. He neither begets nor was begotten.\" (Surah 112:1-4)\\n\\nIn Christianity, we believe that Jesus was begotten. (John 1:14) And we believe Jesus to be God.\\n\\nNow, we have a conundrum. Either Islam is right, and Jesus is not God, nor begotten; or Christianity is right, and Jesus is God, and is begotten. We can't have it both ways. Islam will never hold to a belief that Jesus is God. And Christians will not accept that Jesus is not God, and is not begotten. Therefore, they do not worship the same God.\\n\\nOther \"gods\" fall short as well.  There is no other true god than the One of the Holy Bible found in the Old and New Testaments.\n\nAnswer:",

Each entry is a message between users. There are fields like \"tousername\" and \"fromusername\" in the table. I'd like to set up a page that would list the current 'conversations' between the user viewing the page and the other users talking to him.\\n\\nSo assuming I select * from the table where the \"tousername\" equals the user viewing the page, since there are multiple messages to this user from the same person, if I just used a \"while()\" it would list each entry so every message would show up on this page. I'd like to find a way to select the data from the table but only once for each identical \"fromusername\", if that makes sense. So that way, each 'conversation' would only appear once on the page and you could see a list of users that you were currently having a conversation with, but without duplicate users because of each row in the table.\\n\\nThanks. :p\nAnswer: SELECT fromusername, tousername\\nFROM table\\nGROUP BY tousername, fromusername\\nHAVING fromusername = 'name of user'\\nAND status = 'open'\\n\\nAssuming you have a column, named status, that indicates which conversations are active. That will bring in only the unique pairs you describe.\\n\\nAs described earlier, you could also use DISTINCT:\\n\\nSELECT DISTINCT tousername, fromusername\\nFROM table\\nWHERE fromusername = 'name of user'\\nAND status = 'open'\\n\\nThe GROUP BY statement is computationally more efficient, but unless you are dealing with millions of records and thousands of concurrent requests, you shouldn't see a difference in performance.\n\nAnswer:",

If the latter, the words are legion: pick just about anything from the technology sphere:  \"laptop\", \"palmtop\", \"INTERNET\".\\n\\nAs for words that have disappeared, that is harder, because like the song says about \"old fashioned love songs\", there's \"no need in bringing them back 'cause they're never really gone.\"  The only word that comes to mind right now is a word usage.  I don't think anybody says \"gay\" as a synonym for \"happy\" anymore, since the word has acquired a different meaning.

In how many ways can the grouping be done so that each group has at least one boy?\\n\\nWhen putting a boy in each of the 5 groups, must we take into account of the possible combinations?\\n\\nCan anyone pls help? Thanks!\nAnswer: This is a very difficult counting problem.  I will show one possible grouping and count the number of ways it can be done.\\n\\nTo put just 1 boy in group 1, there are 10 ways to pick the boy and \"combination of 15 things taken 4 at a time\" ways to pick the girls.  This is 10 * (15*14*13*12 / 1*2*3*4) = 10*1365 = 13650 ways to pick 4 girls and 1 boy.\\n-----------------\\nThere are many grouping scenarios; let us start with 1 boy, 1 boy, 1 boy, 2 boys, 5 boys.\\n\\nWe know there are 13650 ways to pick a single boy for group 1.\\n\\nTo then pick a single boy for group 2 from the remaining children, there are 9*(11*10*9*8 / 1*2*3*4) = 9 * 330 = 2970 ways.\\n\\nIf a single boy is then selected for group 3, there are 8 * (7*6*5*4 / 1*2*3*4) = 8*35 = 280 ways.\\n\\nGroup 4 must have at least 2 boys.  There are 7 boys left, and we must choose 2 of them.  So there are 7*6/1*2 = 21 ways to choose those boys with the remaining girls.\\n\\nThe last group would have 5 boys.\\n\\nSo just for this one possible way of grouping - 1 boy, 1 boy, 1 boy, 2 boys, 5 boys, there are \\n13650 * 2970 * 280 * 21 * 1 = 238,378,140,000 ways to arrange them.\\n\\nTHIS MAY NOT BE THE CORRECT FIGURE FOR THIS GROUPING SCENARIO - THERE MAY BE DUPLICATES, IN WHICH CASE THIS FIGURE IS TOO HIGH.  I did not know how to remove them from the figure.  The 13650 is correct for the first, but then we need to look at how many ways are there to grab 4&1, 4&1, 3&2, 0&5 from the remaining children.\\n\\n\\nWe must also account for other grouping scenarios, such as 2, 2, 2, 2, 2 boys; 1,1,2,2,4 boys; 1,1,1,3,4 boys; 1,2,2,2,3 boys, and some others.  For each of these grouping possibilities, the above such calculations would have to be done.  The sum of all the grouping possibilities is the total.\\n\\nSo this is a very difficult counting problem.  I would think you should search for more tools from your professor/teacher, or book.  There may be some more advanced way of saving time rather than go through each grouping scenario one at a time; though that will give the correct answer.\n\nAnswer:",

You should first contact the State Health Dept to find out the application process and rules. Then, you should look into finding a reputable massage therapy school. Don't just try to find the school that is the cheapest or that claims to get you certified in a short amount of time. Find a school (and I am sure San Diego has many) that offers brief business classes as well as the classes you need to be a massage therapist. Also, look into insurance for yourself...most employers dont offer it (maybe it is diff in CA). My massage therpaist overworker herself (10-12 sessions a day) and had to have surgery and she didnt have insurance. So, a school that offers classes like that will help you in the long run.

This may be for some or all classes.\\n\\nStudents who are mainstreamed are most often students with mild to moderate learning or emotional disabilities.  They will have an invoiivualized education plan (IEP) written by a team of people concerned about his/her educational progress.  That team generally incudes special education teacher, regular education teachers, specialists such as speech therapists, parents and representatives from any community service providing agencies.\\n\\nThe IEP will include modifications and accomodations that may be made within the general education setting to allow the student to thrive.  These may be as simple as untimed tests and seating near the teacher, to having the teacher wear a special sound ampligfication device, among others.\\n\\nDoes inclusion work?  Well, that depends on the school district's commitment to inclduing kids in the regular classroom, on the students (and parents') willingness to meet some general classroom expectations, and upon the skill of the classroom teacher.  If everyone works together and expects success, it generally happens.  If any member of the instructional team doubts the child's ability to succedd, it usually becomes a self-fulfilling prohecy, and the child may end up back in a separate special education setting. This special environment is viewed as being a more restictive environment, whereas the incluusion class is viewed as a less restrictive environment, as required by the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA).\\n\\nMy third grader has surprised some naysayers and has been included in regular education for math and special subjects for two years now.  I also enjoy helping students reach their academic goals.\\n\\nI hope this answers your question.\n\nAnswer:",

Mom and Dad would represent guiding figures, possibly in an antagonistic fashion. The snke biting the 4 month old probably sybolizes the act of intercourse. That's according to Freud.\\nA less sexually charged interpretation is that:\\nThe Snake with legs symbolizes deception, it biting your child most likeley symbolizes that you fear your child will be hurt.

And just few min. ago even!\\nSorry, there\u2019s no way at all!!\\nAround you find miraculous drugs and creams, different herbal products and at last some machine as like as the pump and the extensor! Everyone sold those products on anonymous web sites and with high costs! That\u2019s just should be an alarm bell\u2026 eh?\\nMaybe the extensor could give you a penis a bit longer (but thinner) after many times, BUT there are some implications. Aside of a flaccid penis, with the age it will be more difficult to have a strong erection after such treatment! Just value with care the situation and please know that any person is wonderful for what he actually is and the good sex isn\u2019t measured thro the penis length!\\nSex is possible with penis very short even!\\nBe happy anyway!\n\nAnswer:",

Please provide an example / location.\nAnswer: Geologists classify volcanoes in following ways:\\n\\nCinder cones are the simplest type of volcano. They are built from particles and blobs of congealed lava ejected from a single vent. As the gas-charged lava is blown violently into the air, it breaks into small fragments that solidify and fall as cinders around the vent to form a circular or oval cone. Most cinder cones have a bowl-shaped crater at the summit and rarely rise more than a thousand feet or so above their surroundings. Cinder cones are numerous in western North America as well as throughout other volcanic terrains of the world.\\n\\nSome of the Earth's grandest mountains are composite volcanoes--sometimes called stratovolcanoes. They are typically steep-sided, symmetrical cones of large dimension built of alternating layers of lava flows, volcanic ash, cinders, blocks, and bombs and may rise as much as 8,000 feet above their bases. Some of the most conspicuous and beautiful mountains in the world are composite volcanoes, including Mount Fuji in Japan, Mount Cotopaxi in Ecuador, Mount Shasta in California, Mount Hood in Oregon, and Mount St. Helens and Mount Rainier in Washington.\\n\\nShield volcanoes, the third type of volcano, are built almost entirely of fluid lava flows. Flow after flow pours out in all directions from a central summit vent, or group of vents, building a broad, gently sloping cone of flat, domical shape, with a profile much like that of a warrior's shield. They are built up slowly by the accretion of thousands of highly fluid lava flows called basalt lava that spread widely over great distances, and then cool as thin, gently dipping sheets. Lavas also commonly erupt from vents along fractures (rift zones) that develop on the flanks of the cone. Some of the largest volcanoes in the world are shield volcanoes. In northern California and Oregon, many shield volcanoes have diameters of 3 or 4 miles and heights of 1,500 to 2,000 feet. The Hawaiian Islands are composed of linear chains of these volcanoes including Kilauea and Mauna Loa on the island of Hawaii-- two of the world's most active volcanoes.\\n\\nVolcanic or lava domes are formed by relatively small, bulbous masses of lava too viscous to flow any great distance; consequently, on extrusion, the lava piles over and around its vent. A dome grows largely by expansion from within. As it grows its outer surface cools and hardens, then shatters, spilling loose fragments down its sides. Some domes form craggy knobs or spines over the volcanic vent, whereas others form short, steep-sided lava flows known as \"coulees.\" Volcanic domes commonly occur within the craters or on the flanks of large composite volcanoes. The nearly circular Novarupta Dome that formed during the 1912 eruption of Katmai Volcano, Alaska, measures 800 feet across and 200 feet high.\n\nAnswer:",

I was wondering why scientists finally end up on quite small rotator for wind power station. So I find out it was the most efficient construction. However I tried to develop it. Current construction allow to produce electrical energy only from enough strong wind. I focus on sailing-ships and imagine what if add some kind of gathering funnel to increase impact of wind on rotator. The funnel would be regulated like sails in case of wind weakening or getting stronger. Unfortunatelly I cant figure out the angle and size of the funnel because I dont have access to an areodynamic tunnel and I dont have proper knowledge how to calculate it, so I need someone qualificated to test, develope and posibly introduce it into life. I have also idea to build some kind of half and empty inside pyramid with rotator on the ground (maybe even underground). I hope someone work on silencer for the rotator because it would allow to add them even in built upon area.\nAnswer: I doubt it would work very well; you'd need very substantial sails with strong support structures. Being large, they would also require expensive maintenance. I think the current setup has been carefully tuned for efficiency too; the long, thin blades on the turbines are designed for maximum lift (and therefore maximum torque) with minimum drag.\\n\\nSo, my analysis is that it's unlikely to be economical even if it does slightly increase the performance.\n\nAnswer:",

We normally see the sky as blue because the sky scatters higher wavelengths of light more then lower wavelengths of light.  Blue is a short wavelength while red is a long wavelength.  Anyway, when the sun is rising or setting on the horizon you are looking through much more air to see the sun then say, at noon when the sun is straight over head.  There is so much air that you see the red, instead of the blue, because the blue has long since scattered off while the red is still able to travel through the atmosphere to your eyes.\n\nAnswer:",

Allow times for your meals and some kind of entertainment. Once that is done, be very particular to follow that rigorously. I mean when u allocate 10 mins for music, stop it after 10 mins dun go beyond that. I know it is difficult and we lose track of time when we love something. But atleast for the time period u have to follow it. There is no-one or one thing which can motivate urself, but urself. You have maintain the balance.

I get little spots (that are only noticable when I itch and the area turns red). I went to my doctor who told me it is shaving rash, which is possibly true because the itching always starts a day after I shave my legs and usually stops when the hairs have re-grown. He prescribed me anti-histamines but the itchiness returned when I finished the pills. I went back and he said there is not much he can do except prescribe more anti-histamines and also suggested that I try another method of hair removal. I have tried hair removal creams but they make my legs feel like they are on fire. I do not want to wax my legs so please do not suggest that anyone, and nor do i want to go to salons for treatment. Does anyone have any suggestions to get rid of the itchiness. I use emulsifying ointment when I wash and I also apply aqeuous cream after shaving - although they have helped a bit I still itch quite a lot\nAnswer: it might be an allergy, i have a nickle allergy, and nickle is in the blade of razors, i itch just like you,in fact it was really bad earlier tonight, i find it helps to put a cold, wet flannel or towel on my legs, it calms it down, my doctor sent me to the hospital for tests and thats how i found out i was allergic to nickel, itchy legs also affect me at \"that\" time of the month,no cream works for me, try the doctor again and ask for an allergy test, good luck\n\nAnswer:",

How much does this really help humanity?  If we could turn all these people into normal productive members of society, imagine what we could accomplish.  The Islamic people invented computers thousands of years ago, they just did not further expand the concepts, and most Christians are very good business people, if only they would stop devoting their lives to a mystical force in the sky and contribute to society as a whole.  What do you think we could do without religion?\nAnswer: i think that people only have a religion because the feel the chaos and random-ness of the world and it scares them.  If you think there is someone who is in control and knows what is going on you feel like they will step in and make sure that u aren't going to get into anything really bad.  i don't belive in god and don't have a religion but if u can make yourself belive in it, i;m all for it.  at your church or temple you have a really great family that will be there for you no matter what and that is nice to have.  also religion gives us a sense of belonging and importance tha we all strive for.

I need the Microsoft Windows XP Home Edition version 1.1 start-up CD. I doubt this will work but thought I would ask if anyone knew a site I could download it from. I guess I will end up buying one. Any info would be helpful. Thank you.\nAnswer: Try xubuntu, its not Windows, but it is legally free.\\nIts \"ideal for old or low-end machines\"\\nhttp://www.xubuntu.org/\\n\\nIf your looking for long term support (updates) you should choose version 6.06.\\nhttp://cdimage.ubuntu.com/xubuntu/releases/6.06.1/release.1/\\n\\nIf you only plan to keep it for a short time then you can use the short term support one, I think it's supported for about 18 months.\\nhttp://cdimage.ubuntu.com/xubuntu/releases/6.10/release/\\n\\nIn both cases you might want to choose the link \"64-bit PC (AMD64) desktop CD\". I think its made especially for older PCs\\n\\nIn order to burn it to CD, you will need an ISO burner. Don't worry, this program makes it simple\\nhttp://isorecorder.alexfeinman.com/isorecorder.htm\\n\\nAfter you downloaded the ISO recorder and installed it, it will be nowhere to be found except in your add and remove programs; don't worry about it. After you download Xubuntu just right click on the CD image and choose something like burn to CD, or Create ISO image (burn at about 12 times speed for best results).\\n\\nXubuntu is a huge download, about 700 megabytes. If you're using dial up, forget it, other wise use a download manger that will download it in about 2 hours or less. I recommend and use the free Star Downloader\\nhttp://www.download.com/Star-Downloader-Free/3000-12776_4-10508794.html?tag=lst-0-1\\n\\nTo install it, simply restart your computer with the CD already inside and follow directions\\n\\nGood luck\n\nAnswer:",

There is no evidence of another planet on the other side of the sun. \\n\\nIn a hypothetical world where there is a planet on the other side of the sun, the gravity pull from the planet will distort the orbits of the closer planets i.e Mars and Venus.

Do not go into family, sex oreientation, or living arrangments. That is not what the question was intended for\\n\\nExample:\\n\\nI chose software designing because I was interested in programing while I was in highschool. After highschool, I when to (college of your choice) and majored in Software engineering where I excelled, I maintained a 3.2 GPA though my college career.

It helps them undermine America. If these Mexicans become citizens, they can run for the senate or congress in 9 years. If that happens, we will definetly lose our freedoms. They will put their own people in power and them initiate a moslem takeover of our country. Islam is quickly becoming  a major religion in  Mexico, and will soon be here.\n\nAnswer:",

That way you know they both will enjoy the gift.  Put it in a nice card and write a few nice words to them (the card and words are extra credit with your girl).  For wine, you must know if they drink, if it is even appropriate, and what they prefer.  An ex of mine's father was a recovering alcoholic and I didn't find out that after the fact, so I'm glad I didn't get them wine.

I moved here about 5 years ago and i love it. Here is all u need to know.. And it's so true!\\n\\nLIFE IN GEORGIA  \\nThis is for anyone who lives in Atlanta, Georgia, has ever lived  in Atlanta, has ever visited  Atlanta, ever plans to visit Atlanta, knows anyone who already lives in Atlanta, or knows anyone who  has ever heard of  Atlanta. Atlanta is composed mostly of one-way streets. The only way to get out  of downtown Atlanta is to turn around  and start over when you reach Greenville, South  Carolina. \\n \\nAll directions start with, \"Go down Peachtree\" and  include the phrase, \"When you see the Waffle House.\" Except, that in Cobb  County, where all directions begin with, \"Go to the Big  Chicken.\" \\n \\nPeachtree Street has no beginning and no end  and  is not to be confused  with: \\n\\nPeachtree  Circle          Peachtree  Battle \\nPeachtree  Place          Peachtree  Corners \\nPeachtree  Lane           New  Peachtree \\nPeachtree  Road          Old  Peachtree \\nPeachtree Parkway     West  Peachtree \\nPeachtree  Run            Peachtree-Dunwoody \\nPeachtree Terrace       Peachtree-Chamblee \\nPeachtree Avenue       Peachtree Industrial  Boulevard \\nPeachtree  Commons \\n \\nAtlantans only know their way to work and their way home. If you ask anyone for directions, they will always send you down Peachtree. \\n \\nAtlanta is the home of Coca-Cola. Coke's all they drink  there, so don't ask for any other soft drink unless it's made by  Coca-Cola. \\n \\nThe gates at Atlanta's Hartsfield International Airport are about 32 miles away from the Main Concourse, so wear sneakers and pack a lunch. \\n \\nThe 8a.m. rush hour is from 6:30 to 10:30 AM. The 5pm rush hour is from 3:00 to 7:30 PM. Friday's rush hour starts Thursday afternoon and lasts through 2am  Saturday. \\n \\nOnly a native can pronounce Ponce De Leon Avenue, so do not attempt the Spanish pronunciation. People will simply tilt their heads to the right and stare at you. The Atlanta pronunciation is \"pawntz duh LEE-awn.\" \\n \\nAnd yes, they have a street named simply, \"Boulevard.\" \\n \\nThe falling of one raindrop causes all drivers to immediately forget all traffic rules. If a single snowflake falls, the city is paralyzed for three days and it's on all the channels as a  news flash every 15 minutes for a week. Overnight, all grocery stores will be sold out of milk, bread, bottled water, toilet paper, and \\nbeer. \\n \\nIf you're told to go to Bankhead Highway and can't find  it, It's because the name is Veterans Memorial but the locals still call it Bankhead. \\n \\nAlso, once the road you're on crosses another road, the name of the road you're on changes. Some roads names change every half mile or so. \\n \\nI-285, the loop that encircles Atlanta, which has a  posted speed limit of 55 mph (but you have to maintain 80 mph just to keep from getting run over),  is known to truckers as \"The Watermelon  500.\" \\n \\nDon't believe the directional markers on  highways. I-285 is marked \\n \\n\"East\" and \"West\" but you may be going  North or South. The locals identify the direction by referring to the \"Inner Loop\" and the \"Outer Loop.\" If you travel on Hwy 92 North, you will actually be going southeast. \\n \\nNever buy a ladder or mattress in Atlanta. Just go to one of the interstates and you will soon find one in the middle of the road. \\n \\nThe last thing you want to do is give another driver the finger, unless your car is armored, your trigger finger is itchy and your AK-47 has a full clip. \\n \\nPossums sleep in the middle of the road with their feet in the air. \\n \\nThere are 5,000 types of snakes and 4,998 live in Georgia. \\n \\nThere are 10,000 types of spiders. All 10,000 live in Georgia, plus a couple no one has seen before. \\n \\nIf it grows, it sticks. If it crawls, it bites. If you notice a vine tryi\n\nAnswer:",

However, hurricanes have been known to stall or even reverse direction before continuing.  The hurricanes take enormous quantities of heat from the warm sea water and build up organized momentum that may have a life all its own.  When you let water out of bath tubs, there is a natural force (coriolis) that spins the whirlpools in opposite directions north and south of the equator; but you can start the whirlpool in the wrong direction buy hand and it will continue due to momentum.\n\nAnswer:",

Okay, I worked out every week at least 3-4 times a week for a straight hour, and I would walk uphill at the highest incline at 4.3 miles an hr on the treadmill.  This went well, I burned 700 something cals an hour and combined with eating healthy, I managed to get from 130 in July to like 112 or so in early Nov.  Now I realized that my heart rate was NOT high at all- it was barely more than a resting rate! So I started running in the beginning of Nov (this month) and since then (Its been what, three weeks?) I have noticed MAJOR changes in my body.  I am suddenly a LOT slimmer, and have all this extra skin around my stomach from where I obviously just lost fat.  WHY?  Why so quick? Does it have to do with the heart rate? Its weird because I am burning less calories now- I run on the treadmill at a good steady pace of 5.6-6.5 miles an hour for about 30-40 min 5 times a week. But why did these physical changes just start showing up? My diet is good....\nAnswer: the calorie count on the machine may not be accurate.....if your heart rate is higher, you are likely burning more calories\\n\\nalso, you may have built up some muscle, which takes a little time......if this is the case, you should be burning more calories all day and night, and this will definitely speed up weight loss......\\n\\nalso, since you have less weight to lose, any loss will be a lot more obvious.....you may just lose a couple of pounds, and notice a big change, where before you wouldn't have noticed any just from losing that amount.........\n\nAnswer:",

But i was wondering if there are other side effects also, i know that alot of the time (all through the month) i go through alot of emotional ups and downs and i get tired and fatigued easily.  Im in the process of changing doctors because i feel like my doc. is ignoring me since he did the surgery.  But i know that sometimes my cramps are still really bad and nothing helps (otc wise).  But it's like he don't care or something and just gives me the same meds as someone without endo.  Is that o.k.?  I don't want to sound like i \"need\" something stronger, but sometimes i really do.\nAnswer: Find a new doctor.  Endometriosis is something that a lot of doctors just are not able to treat effectively.  \\n\\nI used to have periods that were so bad that I would basically pass out.  If you have pain then your doctor should work with you to manage it.  Telling you to take Midol is not acceptable.\\n\\nI'm not sure if there is a proven connection between endo and fatigue but I'll bet there is.  I've had this pretty much since I started my periods at 11 but it got really bad at 16.  I was diagnosed at 26 and I'm 30 now.  For most of my adult life I feel like I'm 80 and not 30!  I was always tired and slept a lot while my friends were going out and staying up all night.  Can't tell you for sure but that's my experience.\\n\\nRight after my surgery I was put on Lupron.  I only made it 3 months instead of the usual 6 because of the bad side effects.  This is something that I wouldn't recommend as a first choice.  After that I went on BCP.  After experimenting with a few I got on Yasmin which worked for me.  I still have pain every day but it is nothing like it was.  I used to be in constant pain and now I notice it a couple of times a day.  If it gets bad ibuprofen usually helps to keep it down.  \\n\\nEndo is weird because the amount of scarring and implants isn't necessarily related to the amount of pain.  My left ovary is completely covered (can't really see the ovary) and my right only has a couple of little implants.  I feel most of my pain on the right side.  My doctor said that he has seen women with a gut full of scarring who had no symptoms at all.  Also, what one doctor describes as bad another describes as moderate.  Just be aware of this when dealing with doctors.\\n\\nPain is felt differently by different people so it is hard to say what you need.  Find a doctor that is willing to work with you and who isn't quick to say it's in your head.  Don't be afraid to interview doctors and ask lots of questions.  If you aren't comfortable with the answers move on.  Remember that you are hiring them for a service.  Be in control - this is your body.\n\nAnswer:",

Most rectal bleeding comes from the colon, rectum, or anus. The color of the blood often depends on the location of the bleeding in the gastrointestinal tract. The closer the bleeding site is to the anus, the blood will be a brighter red. Bleeding from the transverse colon and the right colon tend to be dark red or maroon colored.

In much earlier days, the clergy were the only ones who could read and write, so the ppl had to come to church to learn the bible from them. Then, the clergy started reinterpreting things to their own benefit. I think there is a line about every man should have an acre of land, but every clergyman should have 100 square acres.

I might have played longer, but I was at a cliquey high school.\\n\\nDid you know Jason Richardson went to my high school for one year, tore up every JV game and the varsity coach still wouldn't put him on the team? He asked to be put on the team, so the coach asked him to do a 360 dunk. He did, and the guy said, \"Ok, you can play JV instead of freshman.\" He then went somewhere else and won for Arthur Hill.\\n\\nWhat a moron, that coach cost my high school a lot of money. It's a poor Catholic school too. It just tells you how stupid people were there...\nAnswer: I never played past PAL in grade school.  I focused on baseball and had plans to play for the Detroit Tigers.  In the D, middle school and high school basketball was very competitive, Cris Webber, Jalen Rose, etc.  I discovered the love for basketball in college in Michigan.  Though I learned I could dunk, I had no chance at the big show (NBA).  \\n \\nBy the way, did you and J Rich attend Nouvel Catholic Central High School before he transferred?\\n\\nOh yes Pistons56, that coach was a dim bulb.  NBA lottery picks don't walk on your court everyday. Nouvel would have crushed the competition with J Rich on board.  I'm sorry things didn't work out for your school.  J Rich is the type of guy that you pull for.\n\nAnswer:",

I m from bangladesh. & My Culture & religion is Islam. Ok, In our country the Sex Relationship is Band. I mean, Free-Sex is not allowed here. But i want to know , as Europeans r believe in free-sex & their society r going for it, then why there are Prostitutes in European Society ? what special things they got from Prostitutes ?\nAnswer: Well, European countries are more open to this topic as you know. But , you must know that prostitution exists in every part of the world. Yes. Even, Saudi Arabia. \\n\\n  Religion/culture does not stop men from doing evilness. I am talking about forced prostitution. \\n\\nAs for Bangladesh, there are plenty of them. You just dont hear about them as much because of whatever reasons. Have you never heard of the Red Light Districts in Calcutta? They have the same culture as us. The situation over there is ridiculous. \\n\\nSince you brought the topic up. You must know that in many Islamic counties like Pak, Saudi, Iran, Yemen, and etc..poor girls from countries like bangladesh are exploited as prostitutes. Now that you know, spead the word to save our sisters.\\n\\nOne other thing, being Muslim does not mean you are imune to such things. In my opinion, many muslims have a thing in them that make them very evil towards girls. You might think I am crazy but what about the 250 000 sisters raped by Pakistani Muslims. Even in BD, thugs kill women's soul without much provocation.\n\nAnswer:",

They collapsed becaue the steel columns that held up the buildings buckled. When steel is exposed to high temperatures for an extended period of time, its elastic modulus (or stiffness) decreases at a very fast rate. It is believed that the protective fire coating was blown off the steel at the initial impact, causing the steel to be exposed to higher temperatures for a longer period of time. \\n\\nThe steel columns in the building were connected by trusses that were supposed to support their own weight, the weight of the concrete floors, and the weight of all the office equipment. The high temperature damaged the material and one floor collapsed onto another. Once the first floor collapsed, all the floor above it lost their support and fell.\n\nAnswer:",

Can someone sum up the 1st series in a few paragraphs (your own words)? 10points to the most informative answer.\nAnswer: At the beginning they crash a plane and are stranded on an island. There are about 20 core people in the main storyline. You get the basic 'no one can trust each other' routine. Lots of man to man stand offs and women looking quite attractive in a 'stranded on a desert island' kind of way. They realise eventually that there is a 'thing' after them. They can't see it but it is killing them one by one. Then it doesn't really carry on from there. \\n\\nAll background is told in flashback. That is a main story device in the series. They go on lots of hikes to 'discover' things about the island and they are faced with number codes and morse code radio messages etc. which they never really figure out. The last episode leaves them finding a mine shft on the island. That is the cliffhanger.\\n\\nYou are not missing anything by not watching it. It is simply not very good TV. It keeps people watching it based on the fact that none of the 'mysteries'(storyline and so called plots and sub plots) are ever resolved. That is one of the reasons the conspiracy stuff on the internet is talking about it. They think it's all a big mind control experiment when actually it's just a stupid TV show.\n\nAnswer:",

Is your assignment to argue that retribution is socially cohesive, or did you come up with this yourself?\\n\\nThis is what I can think of:\\n\\nRetributive justice is based on the idea that criminals should be punished for undermining social \"harmony\" or \"balance.\"  Therefore, we can't dole out retributive punishment before we first have a definition of what is social harmony or balance.  Social harmony and balance can be defined through laws, custom, or religion.  The PROCESS of defining social harmony and balance is socailly cohesive because, to some extent, we must generally agree on what the definition of social order is.  In other words, the PROCESS of accepting and agreeing on laws/customs/religion is socially cohesive.\\n\\nThe rehabilitation theory of punishment is probably the most socially cohesive because it is based on rehabiliting the criminal so that he can successfully reenter society.\n\nAnswer:",

They give so much love, have could they not survive death?

I think that I am overweight, but people that look at me don't believe that I weigh 138. I just tell them that they need to see me naked to tell.. which i won't let them. But anyway, if that to heavy?? what is an ideal weight? i don't want to look anorexic or anything, just thinner, and toned.\nAnswer: I know exactly what you mean, I am considered overweight according to the scale chart I have provided. I am 5'1 as well and I am about 135 lbs. But what you need to take in cosideration is your body frame. Are u a small, medium, or large frame body. If you can grip your wrist with your thumb and your pointer finger then ur small frame if not then you gotta estimate approximately how much space theres between those two fingers and label yourself as medium or large frame, then refer to the chart to see your ideal weight for you height.\\n\\nBut you know that its good to know that as long as you dont look your weight then its all good. Unfortunately when we see ourselves nude we feel fat, but with clothes you can hide those rolls and love handles. So decide how much weight you need to loose, Im sure its not alot, maybe some situps will just tone your stomach and you dont need to loose pounds.\\n\\ngood luck.\n\nAnswer:",

Who pays taxes. Who puts their earnings back into the economy. Who obeys our laws (especially the laws governing getting into this country). So what rights, exactly, are they talking about?\\n\\nIllegal immigrants' comments welcome---go ahead and bash me. I can dish it and I can take it.\nAnswer: I agree with some, but not all of your thoughts...\\n\\n1) when they come here and work, they are paying taxes - it gets taken out of their paychecks. So does Social Security. \\n2) when they go to the store here, they pay taxes, just like you and I. Same thing at the gas pumps, liquor stores, mall, etc. Its not like they come here, work and take the money to Mexico to go grocery shopping. So, they are contributing to the economy - more so than rich folks in America that hide all their money so they DONT have to pay taxes. \\n3) they are humans...they have HUMAN RIGHTS. \\n\\nLast study I read said that Illegals contriubute $90 BILLION dollars to Social Security a year, and only receive $5 BILLION in outside aide. That leaves $85 BILLION to the rest of us. Im also willing to bet that there are more African Americans in our prison system than illegal immigrants - so they are obviously following our laws, despite having \"jumped a border.\" At least they arent killing each other over gang territory or robbing their own people or getting over on charities like wwhats been going on with all the Katrina aide...\\n\\nNow that I think about it, I dont agree at all with you!\n\nAnswer:",

Jail in KS file a complaint of abuse against the operators of the facility?\nQuestion: This particular inmate, due to his legal expertise, has been a thorn in the side of the prosecuting atty, judge, and others.  He has consistently been denied medical care for a serious vascular condition and his mail is being withheld (legal documents bringing suit against both the judge and prosecuting atty that require some editing on his part).  The mail is not contraband in any way, and withholding it impedes his legal case.  Since he is representing himself, it is imperative he receive his mail in a relatively timely manner.  His mail is not being withheld as a result of any disciplinary action for breaking jail rules, nor is he a combative, argumentive, or difficult inmate.  Who can he report this harassment to in order to stop this sort of discriminatory behavior?\nAnswer: One would safely assume that since you are aware of the situation, that this person is having some success in communicating with the outside world?  With that in mind, I would do my best to get in touch with the sympathetci media outlets (think national/regional as opposed to local) the ACLU, Amnesty International, The John Howard Association (this would be my first pick personally), the justice project at Northwestern University (IL), also with any other university/law school or organization that does pro bono type work, and many times have contacts at media outlets that may be able to exert some pressure on \"the powers at be\" through those channels.  Not to be a pain in the rear, but IMHO it is very impractical and unwise to represent yourself, this situation being a perfect example of the pitfalls...in an ideal world, he should/could contact the KS Attorney General's Office, the Governor's Office, or perhaps even the Dept. Of Justice in DC, however in this day and age most complaints against \"the establishment\" or \"the system\" fall on deaf ears amongst other members of the machine, particularly as we seem to be removing the concepts of real justice and  humanity from our increasingly greedy and corrupt society and government bodies at a breakneck pace...bottom line tell the inmate to KEEP HIS NOSE CLEAN (as they are undoubtedly gunning for him) keep trying and good luck as the odds are highly stacked against him...\n\nAnswer:",

However, the mite dies in a couple of days and does not reproduce. The mites may cause you to itch for several days, but you do not need to be treated with special medication to kill the mites. Until your pet is successfully treated, mites can continue to burrow into your skin and cause you to have symptoms.\"\\n\\nSo the answer to your question is yes they can have scabies, but a different type.\n\nAnswer:",

It touches somewhat on the recent history of terrorist groups including Al Qaeda and actually has the full text of the declarations of war against the US  and the Israelis made by Bin Laden. The US military presence in the Middle East is cited as a reason particularly in Iraq, Saudi Arabia and Lebanon and Palestine. There is strong disagreement with some of the Saudi regime's anti-Islamic policies and deep resentment of US support of Israel. There also was resentment on the lowest levels over the US pullout under George Bush senior (in Iraq).  Bin Laden fostered the growth of the terrorist units by being a major player in the drug trade and threw millions or billions into a cohesive coalition of groups such as al-Hiahd, al-Islamiyya, ul-Ulema, etc. It is claimed that the US has been enmeshed in political battles there for not only economic but for religious reasons as well.

And some of the things he mentions may at least partly explain how we came to say \"Wensday\".\\n\\nBUT  that doesn't entirely explain the spelling.    Nor even the pronunciation.   In fact, the written records show that it was all a bit messier than that.  Apparently the pronunciation varied through the centuries and from one dialect to another.  (And to this day there are some dialects in which the 'd' can still be heard.   Some of this is documented in the Oxford English Dictionary.) \\n\\nA couple of  obervations and suggestions:\\n\\n1)  SPELLING\\nWe retained the spelling with 'd' either because dialects that pronounced it were dominant (or at least 'won out' on this point) OR from the desire of teachers and grammarians to preserve some of the ROOT form of the word (\"Wodens-die\" and the like) even when it was no longer pronounced (something scholarly sorts have OFTEN done, at times even inserting unpronounced letters \"back\" into words they believed had come from a particular root).  OR maybe is was some of each.\\n\\nBut though the \"d\" won in the SPELLING fight,  \"wensday\" won the PRONUNCIATION battle.\\n\\n2) PRONUNCIATION\\n At least one of the written forms listed in the OED is wendesdei (from ca. 1275).   This inversion of letters (called \"metathesis\") to simplify the pronounciation is another common occurrence in spoken language.  Compare the word \"comfortable\" which is widely pronounced as \"comfterbl\" or even [losing the r entirely\"comtubl\"].     \\n\\nNotice that these sorts of changes -- loss of middle sounds, esp. vowels (called \"syncope\" or \"elision\") and metathesis -- are very common  in the UN-accented syllables of longer words.\\n\\nAt any rate, a pronuciation \"Wendesday\" > \"Wendsday\" is very easy to understand.  And note that if you can scarcely hear a difference between \"wends\" and \"wens\".  That's because the d an z-sounding s are both voiced AND pronounced at the same point in the mouth.  [Cf. how \"scents\" and \"sense\" sound the same, despite the T in the first.]\n\nAnswer:",

A DNA molecule refers to just a double stranded molecule but a chromosome is a condensed form of DNA complexed with proteins. An intermediate is the chromatin which is a network of fibrils consisting of DNA and they exist when the cell is not dividing.\\n\\n2. Prokaryotes have a single chromosme that contains only few proteins and appear as an electron-dense irregular shaped region called the nucleoid which is not enclosed by membrane. If you stretched this out, the chromosome would be a circular loop attached to the plasma membrane of the cell. Also, when they replicate, the replication occurs in two directions at once since the DNA molecule is cirular. Eukaryotes have much more proteins and when not being replicated are in the membrane bound nucleas as chromatin. Then the DNA replicates, it is dones by numerous origins of replication initially called replication bubbles that meet up to form replication forks. The broken segments of this replication method is calked Okazaki framents.\\n\\n3.Autosomal chromosomes are the rest of the chromosomes that are nonsex and are the same no matter what sex the person is. For example, there are 46 chromosomes in humans and one PAIR is your sex chromosome which determine your sex (girl = XX and boy = XY) while the other 44 are autosomal which you inherited no matter what your sex was.\\n\\n4. The word \"complexity\" is hard to define here because it is ambiguous and subjective. To us humans, a zebra may seem less complex since we cant tell them appart, but from the zebra's prospective, their unique stripe patterns differntiate very clearly who is who. At birth, the mother zebra spends 20 min. with its calf so it can memorize stripe patterns. However, understand the aim of the question, the answer is no. There is no proven evidence that shows a direct correlation of chromosome number to complexity. Well, you may think that since there are more chromosomes, these organisms have more alleles coded for them and are thus more complex. Not necessarily true. Some genes code for mutliple traits while others may have multiple genes for one trait. Also the vast number of genes that are coded in a single chromosome is very high. Ex. A Human has 46 chromosomes but a Crayfish has 200! Therefore more chromosomes do not mean higher \"complexity\" (at least in this implied definition)\n\nAnswer:",

Instead a person should use \"a person\" or some other indirect noun. So, it kind of bugs me when people answer questions where someone ISN'T asking personal advice with \"you need to\" and \"you shouldn't,\" etc. Did anyone else learn this way?\nAnswer: Yeah, it is correct to say \"one\" or \"a person\". It's so much easier just to say \"you\" tho. I always find myself tripping up on that. I think most people use \"you\" the wrong way.\n\nAnswer:",

Pl quote the verse .\nAnswer: Well its symbolic and it is for the unity of Muslims so that they don't get confused  in praying and should be praying to one point. secondly Mecca is in the mid point of the  world  so  easy for anyone to face that  and pray. Well the prayers are answered even if one go somewhere and could'nt find out the right direction and had  prayed  in some wrong direction . In the beginning there was some confusion about which direction one should pray , so to make it easy Allah has ordered to pray towards Macca.its just for the ease of muslims. Yes its ordered in Quran.\\nQuran 2:144\\n\"Indeed We see the turning of your face to heaven, so We shall surely turn you to a qiblah which you shall like; turn then your face towards the Sacred Mosque, and wherever you are, turn your face towards it, and those who have been given the Book most surely know that it is the truth from their Lord; and Allah is not at all heedless of what they do\n\nAnswer:",

So far, bird flu has only been passed from birds either to other birds or, in isolated cases, to humans. However, if the flu mutates into a strain that can pass from human to human, people will have no immunity and the flu will probably pass rapidly from person to person, creating a pandemic. Flu vaccines can only be made to protect against a particular virus, and, since the virus has yet to be passed from human to human, no vaccine can be developed.\\n\\nIn Asia, many people live with ducks and chickens in their homes and in their yards. Health and veterinary officials worldwide recently announced that a key way to stop the spread of the disease is to improve farming practices, segregating poultry from humans, and culling birds that have been infected with the deadly virus.\\n\\nWhat's next? When asked for predictions as to the seriousness of the pandemic, should one occur, experts have based their projections on a similar pandemic that occurred in 1918-1919. Up to a billion people fell ill, and nearly 100 million died worldwide. Translating to today's figures, they project that some 30-60 percent of the world's population could be infected by the virus, and over 300 million people worldwide could die. In the meantime, good hygiene remains the best prevention: keep hands well-washed, and avoid contact with people who have been infected with the virus.\n\nAnswer:",

I say The Great KHALI was in \"The Longest Yard\" with Adam Sandler, but my friend says he wasn't. This friend of mine is a HUGE wrestling fan and it would please me to NO end to be able to tell him, \"Ha Ha! Sucked in!! I was right and you were wrong!!\" So, not only is there $50 on the line here, it's also bragging right s for eternity!! lol\\nSo, can anyone help me? I can't remember the name of the character I'm thinking of, but he was the big guy who was bashing his head against the wall the first time you see him in the movie and at the big game at the end of the film he said to Adam Sandler's character, \"I'm glad you're back, now I don't have to stab you\"\\nSo, am I right? Is that The Great KHALI?\nAnswer: Singh played the role of \"Turley\" in the 2005 remake of the film The Longest Yard. He plays an unstable inmate with an insecure attitude. In addition, the character of Turley is shown to be virtually unstoppable and limitless in strength. He easily grounds the second biggest man, Switowski, played by the 6 ft 6 in and 340 lb Bob Sapp. Turley is built up as an insanely powerful man throughout the film, who manages to run a Touchdown despite three of the opposing team's players on his back.\n\nAnswer:",

Carlos Lee does have more HR and RBI though.  But Lee is too hot now (on the pace of 70 HR and 140 RBI), you have to expect him to cool off.\\n\\nThe problem for this trade is Joe Nathan, he is too good to be traded.  He is one of the top 5 closers in the league, and best among your closers.  Since Chad Tracy has closing stats as Carlos Lee, it doesn't make sense to give out Nathan at the same trade.\n\nAnswer:",

How long depends on the thickness of the sedimentary rocks deposited on top of the particular clay layer (pressure helps evacuate water and increases temperature); whether or not there is an external heat source (volcanic activity, magma chamber nearby, metamorphic processes - faults, etc.). SO - time can't be specified unless is a case study, temperature -  between 150 and 200 degrees C. Above 200 c is the schist kingdom in metamorphic rocks.\n\nAnswer:",

The reason people have that huge pot belly is because of a buld up of feces in their organs. I know, it sounds gross, but it gets worse. By the time the average person is forty, they oculd have as much as TWENTY-FIVE Pounds in their intestines. CLEANSE. The best way to do it, is a five day full body fasting cleanse.

Or any other.\nAnswer: Not too bad, some of my friends work for Schlumberger, but it depends on what your job is exactly. If its a basic entry level field engineer you may find that it is quite tough as of the current climate at the moment. In a month expect to be working more than 14 days and not having too much time off. As the oil price is very high, most companies are very busy and thus are the people. Its a great time to get started as you progress much quicker than expected.  Depending on your qualifications, if you have a degree go into M/LWD or if not go into Wireline. Both jobs are good although wireline is a bit more stressful if things are not going to plan. If you want you can email me and I can suggest which companies to apply to.\n\nAnswer:",

(Of course, add on fringe benefits like insurance, and your retirement plan, which will let you retire nicely with 25 or 30 years, or at age 62 or 65.)  \\n\\nTeacher salary can vary greatly, depending on location, degree earned, and years of experience.  School districts that pay the most often have the highest costs of living (housing cost, etc.)  In Florida, beginning teacher salary (bachelor's degree, no experience) is $27,000 - 30,000.  Some districts pay more; others less.  Fortunately now, salary schedules are usually available at school district web-sites.  Decide where you want to live, and do a Yahoo search for the local school district web-site.  You will probably be able to find a salary schedule online.  If not, just call the school district personnel office, and they will be happy to tell you.\n\nAnswer:",

It is connected with the Arctic Ocean by the Greenland Sea and Smith Sound; with the Pacific Ocean by Drake Passage, the Straits of Magellan, and the Panama Canal; and with the Indian Ocean by the Suez Canal and the expanse between Africa and Antarctica. The shortest distance across the Atlantic Ocean (c.1,600 mi/2,575 km) is between SW Senegal, W Africa, and NE Brazil, E South America. The principal arms of the Atlantic Ocean are Hudson and Baffin bays, the Gulf of Mexico, and the Caribbean Sea in the west; the Baltic, North, Mediterranean, and Black seas in the east; and the Weddell Sea in the south. More large rivers, including the Mississippi, the Congo, and the Amazon, drain into the Atlantic than into any other ocean.\\n\\nOcean Floor\\n\\nThe floor of the Atlantic has an average depth of c.12,000 ft (3,660 m). It is separated from that of the Arctic Ocean by a submarine ridge extending from SE Greenland to N Scotland; part of the floor (c.3,000 ft/910 m deep) is known as \u201ctelegraph plateau\u201d because of the network of cables laid there. A shallow submarine ridge across the Strait of Gibraltar separates the Mediterranean basin from the Atlantic and limits the exchange of water between the two bodies. The Mid-Atlantic Ridge (c.300\u2013600 mi/480\u2013970 km wide), a submarine mountain range extending c.10,000 mi (16,100 km) from Iceland to near the Antarctic Circle, generally follows the trend of the coastlines of the continents. It rises to an average height of c.10,000 ft (3,050 m), and a few peaks emerge as islands. The ridge, which is the center of volcanic activity and earthquakes, has a great rift that is constantly widening (see seafloor spreading) and filling with molten rock from the earth's interior. As a result the Western Hemisphere and Europe and Africa are moving away from each other. The Mid-Atlantic Ridge divides the floor of the Atlantic Ocean into eastern and western sections that are composed of a series of deep-sea basins (abyssal plains). The greatest depth (c.28,000 ft/8,530 m) is the Milwaukee Deep, in the Puerto Rico Trench, N of Puerto Rico. Scientific knowledge of the ocean floor dates from the Challenger expedition (1872\u201376).\n\nAnswer:",

There have been droughts years, flood years, warmer years, colder ones, more hurricanes, more tornadoes, etc.  The weather field is relatively new and climate has not been studied for more than a hundred years or so.

Basically its crazy fast but I hear that the core 2 duo is a bit faster and lot cooler temperature wise. The temp makes a difference cause you want to be able to use it on your lap etc. I got a sweet deal on the one I have and so its loaded with ram and the top graphics card. If I buy the new core 2 duo macbook pro for 2000 it will have a slightly faster chip (2.16) but al gig less ram and only half the memory on the graphics card. Do you think I should just keep the one I have or should I get the new one?\nAnswer: Forget the Intel \"Core 2 Duo\" and look instead to those using the new AMD Turion.

Honestly are't both sides guilty.\nAnswer: What a fantastic question.\\nThe politicians are definitely dividing, because most of the American public straddles smack dab down the middle of just about every issue facing America today.  That means that most of us are fairly reasonable and mindful of the complexities that face us locally and nationally; daily and life long. But because of this phenomenon, politicians have to initiate a polarization in order to pull people off of the proverbial fence. How can you have a debate if most people agree? The challenge then, is to package an argument (no matter how seemingly insignificant) to inflame  so that people will start to choose sides. This model makes it easy to hide other real issues that won't be addressed due to the smokescreen created by the subsequent brou ha ha.\n\nAnswer:",

Years ago, black was the colcor of choice where I lived.  The last few funerals I attended people came dressed in a range of various formal and informal styles and colors.  \\n\\nSo, unless you've got a wardrobe like Sid Vicious or Brittney Spears, I'd guess that the cleanest and most conservative clothes you have would probably be fine.

I'm very confused!?\nQuestion: Am really close friends with a girl. At times, she calls me Hubi/Sweetie. She asked me out on a date and I said Yes. She then says that she just wants to be friends and was joking - I say OK.\\n\\nThen she says she doesn't want a boyfriend ever again because shes been hurt in the past and is looking for a husband - I know that she is looking to get married [Shes always been open about this]. She askes me if I honestly like her - I say Yes. She says we should get to know each other - I say OK. A day later says she just wants to be friends because she doesn't want to get hurt again and mess up our friendship! She constantly keeps asking me if I'm OK with her or angry!\\n\\nWhat does it mean?\nAnswer: It means either she's bipolar or has another mental problem, or she's just extremely indecisive and doesn't know what she wants.  If you really want to be with her romantically, you need to sit down with her and make definitive, clear statements about everything.  That way, she can't just change her mind later.\\n\\nIf you're not interested in a future with her romantically, stay her friend and move on.  Just don't get jealous if she finds someone else.\n\nAnswer:",

So far from what I've seen he ref'd the Ecuador-Germany game and Saturday's Portugal-Holland game where he was handing out yellows and reds like candy. But in general there's been some serious fouls that haven't been called that I think would deserve a card and some not so serious ones that end up getting cards. Its just really frustrating to watch teams pour their hearts and souls in a great match and have it end as a result of some bad officiating. That's all. Just wanted opinions from others out there!\nAnswer: No, I think the refereeing in the past has been bad. The players have been allowed to run wild for so long. Finally, some boundries are being set and the players are walking right over those boundries. There are consequences for such actions.\\n\\nIt is the PLAYER'S job to learn what will and won't be allowed, and the way these players are so slow to learn, I wonder how many brain cells they have.\\n\\n95% of the calls and 99% of the cards I have seen can be backed up by the Laws of the Game.\n\nAnswer:",

The formula for adding the probabilities is valid only if the events are independent, like in this case. Otherwise you have to calculate the case when 2 events are simultaneously true and substract this from the sum: p(a OR b) = p(a) + p(b) - p(a AND b). Here you cant have 2 red beds and 2 green ones after 2 extractions, 2 red and two black, etc. So p(a AND b) in the above formula is 0.\n\nAnswer:",

Osteoporotic bones are more susceptible to fracture. Osteoporosis is defined by the World Health Organization (WHO) as either a bone mineral density 2.5 standard deviations below peak bone mass (20-year-old sex-matched healthy person average) as measured by DXA, or any fragility fracture. While treatment modalities are becoming available (such as the bisphosphonates), prevention is still considered the most important way to reduce fracture. Due to its hormonal component, more women, particularly after menopause, suffer from osteoporosis than men. In addition it may be caused by various hormonal conditions, smoking and medications (specifically glucocorticoids).\\n\\nclick here:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osteoporosis#Signs_and_symptoms\n\nAnswer:",

Speak with friends and family members who you really trust because they maybe able to refer you to someone. They can give you some insight. Also when speaking with a realtor make for sure that they take the time to explain to you EVERYTHING. Once you sign the contract , there is no changing your mind. It is always good to speak with someone who has had many years in this field. There are so many people who have built homes and are turning around and selling them but, aren't experts in the field of real estate. That is only one area of it.

Crook. Read it cover to cover! By the way: It does not just apply to women.  I have been there, so I sympathize, and I will tell you it is a long tough road. Candida thrives in an acidic environment.  The American Diet is 80% acidic, 20% alkaline typically.  In order to get healthy those percentages need to be turned to 20% acidic, 80% alkaline! What are acidic foods? All white flours and sugars, everything processed and made with corn syrup, dextrose, sucrose.  You have to AVOID these at all costs! What is alkaline? Healthy foods!  Fruits, veggies, meats, whole grains.  Candida thrives in an acidic environment.  What is the best cure?  FOUR THINGS:  WILD MOUNTAIN OREGANO OIL, LOTS OF FRESH CHOPPED GARLIC, AND GRAPEFRUIT SEED EXTRACT, and PH balance pills (VAXA makes these). Don't forget to drink plenty of pure water. WHILE TAKING THESE FOUR REMEDIES, MAKE SURE YOU EAT PLENTY OF ACIDOPHILIS (YOGURT, ACIDOPHILIS PILLS).  IT IS NEEDED TO REPLACE THE GOOD BACTERIA IN YOUR SYSTEM.  WHEN CANDIDA OCCURS, THE BAD BACTERIA HAS OVERTAKEN THE GOOD, CAUSING FAR REACHING PROBLEMS.  TIREDNESS, MOOD SWINGS, ALLERGIES, SKIN PROBLEMS, MEMORY LOSS, CHRONIC FATIGUE, THE LIST IS ENDLESS.  CANDIDA CAN ALSO MIMIC THE SYMPTOMS OF OTHER DISEASES.  It also does not disappear overnight.  Sometimes an individual does not see improvement for a few months, and will have die off symptoms before they feel better.  Stick with the restrictive diet, and remember when you cheat, the bad bacteria is allowed to grow again, because CANDIDA LIVES ON SUGAR (THE HERB STEVIA IS A LIFESAVER IF YOU NEED A SUGAR REPLACEMENT IT IS 300X SWEETER THAN SUGAR AND IS NATURAL) Stay away from Nutrasweet, saccharin, Splenda-these are all chemicals that will cause more problems!!  One more thing:  If you have Candida, chances are you have a parasite problem as well.  Be sure to do a parasite cleanse also.  Parasites can also cause far reaching problems.\n\nAnswer:",

I am not allowed by the Housing Association to keep any pets.  I really would like to get myself a little dog (my disability would not prevent me from looking after it, and looking after it would help my condition)  Under the HRA 1998, you have a right to have a family, also a right to a private life, could the Housing Association be infringing on my right to this? I am thinking of getting one anyway and if they try to evict me, I will take the case to the European Court - advice, comments - please.\nAnswer: you must exhaust all courts in UK before going to europe so forget that one. the UK pays little heed to european or UN law.\\ntake the opposite approach - get your dog - fight to keep or be transferred to a house that allows pets ! good luck\n\nAnswer:",

Other countries possess weapons of mass destruction and ballistic missiles. With Saddam, there is one big difference: He has used them. Not once, but repeatedly. Unleashing chemical weapons against Iranian troops during a decade-long war. Not only against soldiers, but against civilians, firing Scud missiles at the citizens of Israel, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain and Iran. And not only against a foreign enemy, but even against his own people, gassing Kurdish civilians in Northern Iraq. \\n\\n\"The international community had little doubt then, and I have no doubt today, that left unchecked, Saddam Hussein will use these terrible weapons again.\" \\n\\nThis situation presents a clear and present danger to the stability of the Persian Gulf and the safety of people everywhere.

At the end of a lower mass star's life (for stars up to about 8 times the mass of the sun), the star puffs up, and loses the outer layers of gas surrounding it.  All this gas goes out into space where it can be seen as what we call a planetary nebula.\\n\\nOriginally the word \"nebula\" was applied to any astronomical object that was not a star or a memeber of our solar system (planets, asteroids etc), the word essentially means \"cloud.\"\\n\\nAs telescopes got better people started to find many different types of nebulae. A Spiral Nebula looks like, well a spiral, today we know that these are spiral galaxies.  Planetary Nebula were named because the looked round, and a number of them had the same greenish color that Uranus had been seen to have by Hershel.\n\nAnswer:",

Circumcision of the general male population in the US was not common until after World War 2. This was medically-based not religiously-based. A popular myth spread that male circumcision results in fewer infections and the wife of a circumcised male was less likely to get any of the reproductive cancers. This theory has since been proved baseless. Male circumcision rates have fallen drastically in the last couple of decades. Only a minority of males in the US are circumcised as part of their religion.\n\nAnswer:",

I was in Paris recently and did see many baguettes and bikes, especially with motors, but not a beret in sight! My impression of the Parisians- intelligent, sophisticated, friendly, classy. No ear splitting music, loud cell phone conversations, jeans and sneakers on anyone over 20. They dress well, behave well, take the time to enjoy life. They don't run themselves ragged to do more business, make more money, appease the stockholders. Their tax rate is high- they are willing to pay more than lip service to care for all their citizens. Gas is expensive, traffic is bad and space is scarce, so even new cars are small and efficient, they are for transportation, not status symbols- not a Hummer anywhere. And the public transportation is outstanding! Very wise in my opinion.  Maybe you're watching old movies: there would of course be old cars, n'est-ce pas?

Sadly, alot of times you can't get the fathers to voluntarily come in and see the Judge. So, they issue these attachments. More than likely your boyfriend didn't live up to his part of the bargain. I would recommend he get it taken care of...it can turn into a criminal matter. He'll probably have to go before the Judge. The Judge will ask some questions, maybe put some restrictions on him as far as his support. Nothing too serious, but like I said IT CAN turn serious...\\n\\nIts not really a \"criminal charge\", but attachments are usually served by law enforcement. He won't have any criminal record from a civil order. Good luck.\n\nAnswer:",

Other lifeforms, stuff like that.\nAnswer: Did God have a beginning?\\n\\nPs. 90:2: \u201cBefore the mountains themselves were born, or you proceeded to bring forth as with labor pains the earth and the productive land, even from time indefinite to time indefinite you are God.\u201d\\n\\nIs that reasonable? Our minds cannot fully comprehend it. But that is not a sound reason for rejecting it. Consider examples: (1) Time. No one can point to a certain moment as the beginning of time. And it is a fact that, even though our lives end, time does not. We do not reject the idea of time because there are aspects of it that we do not fully comprehend. Rather, we regulate our lives by it. (2) Space. Astronomers find no beginning or end to space. The farther they probe into the universe, the more there is. They do not reject what the evidence shows; many refer to space as being infinite. The same principle applies to the existence of God.\\n\\nOther examples: (1) Astronomers tell us that the heat of the sun at its core is 27,000,000 degrees Fahrenheit (15,000,000\u00b0 C.). Do we reject that idea because we cannot fully comprehend such intense heat? (2) They tell us that the size of our Milky Way is so great that a beam of light traveling at over 186,000 miles per second (300,000 km/sec) would require 100,000 years to cross it. Do our minds really comprehend such a distance? Yet we accept it because scientific evidence supports it.\\n\\nWhich is more reasonable\u2014that the universe is the product of a living, intelligent Creator? or that it must have arisen simply by chance from a nonliving source without intelligent direction? Some persons adopt the latter viewpoint because to believe otherwise would mean that they would have to acknowledge the existence of a Creator whose qualities they cannot fully comprehend. But it is well known that scientists do not fully comprehend the functioning of the genes that are within living cells and that determine how these cells will grow. Nor do they fully understand the functioning of the human brain. Yet, who would deny that these exist? Should we really expect to understand everything about a Person who is so great that he could bring into existence the universe, with all its intricate design and stupendous size?\\n\\nInfinite, but approachable. The true God is infinite and beyond the mind of man fully to fathom. The creature could never hope to become equal to his Creator or understand all the workings of His mind. (Ro 11:33-36) But He can be found and approached, and He supplies his worshiper with all that is necessary for the worshiper\u2019s welfare and happiness. (Ac 17:26, 27; Ps 145:16) He is ever at the zenith of his ability and willingness to give good gifts and presents to his creatures, as it is written: \u201cEvery good gift and every perfect present is from above, for it comes down from the Father of the celestial lights, and with him there is not a variation of the turning of the shadow.\u201d (Jas 1:17) Jehovah always acts within his own righteous arrangements, doing all things on a legal basis. (Ro 3:4, 23-26) For this reason all of his creatures can have complete confidence in him, knowing that he always abides by the principles he establishes. He does not change (Mal 3:6), and there is no \u201cvariation\u201d with him in the application of his principles. There is no partiality with him (De 10:17, 18; Ro 2:11), and it is impossible for him to lie.\u2014Nu 23:16, 19; Tit 1:1, 2; Heb 6:17, 18.\n\nAnswer:",

The speaker of this hymn is an officiant at the Temple of Athena of Argos, preparing for the ritual bath of the statue of the Goddess. \\n\\nAll you that are companions of the Bath of Athena, come forth, come forth! I heard just now the snorting of her holy horses, and the Goddess is ready to go. Hurry you now, O fair-haired daughters of Pelasgus, hurry! Never did Athena wash her mighty arms before she drove the dust from the flanks of her horses - not even when, her armor all defiled with filth, she returned from the war with the lawless Giants; but far first she loosed from the car her horses\u2019 necks, and in the springs of Oceanus washed the flecks of sweat, and from their mouths that champed the bit: cleansed the clotted foam. \\n\\nO come, daughters of Achaea, but bring not myrrh nor alabaster (I hear the whir of her axle now!); bring not, you companions of the Bath, for Pallas myrrh, nor alabaster (for Athena does not wear perfume), neither bring you a mirror: she is sure of her beauty. Not even when Paris judged the contest on mount Ida; the great Goddess looked not into orichale nor into the transparent flow of the river Simois, nor did Hera. But Aphrodite took the shining bronze and often altered and again altered the same lock. While my Goddess, after running a two-hundred stade course, like the twin Spartan stars on the banks of Eurotas, then did her simple annointments: oil from her olive tree, applied with skill; and the blush, my dear maidens, that ran up her body was like the color of the morning rose or the seed of the pomegranate. Therefore now also bring you only this masculine virgin oil, with which Castor and with which Hercules anoint themselves. And bring her a comb all of gold, that she may comb her hair, when she had anointed her glossy tresses. \\n\\nCome forth, Athena! This company pleasing to your heart awaits you, the maiden daughters of Acestor\u2019s mighty sons. Athena, come, the ancient rite is begun, the shield of Diomedes is carried to Inachus, an Argive rite taught by Eumedes, your beloved priest who on a time, when he knew that the people were plotting and planning his death, fled with your holy image to the hill called Creion - and set you in rocks, you, O Goddess, on the rugged rocks, whose name is now the Pallatid rocks. \\n\\nCome forth, Athena, Sacker of Cities, Athena, helmeted in gold, Athena, who rejoices in the crash of horses and shields. Come. Today, the city will drink from small springs and fountains, but not from the river; girls will dip pitchers in Physadeia today, maidens will bear water from Amymone's pool where the daughter of Danaus lives. For, mingling his waters with gold and with flowers, the river Inachus will flow from his pastoral hills, bringing fair water for the Bath of Pallas Athena. But beware, O Pelasgian river, brim your eyes to the Queen: the man who sees Pallas, Keeper of Cities, naked, shall look on Argos for this the last time. Come, Lady Athena, and meanwhile I shall say somewhat unto these. The story is not mine but told by others. \\n\\nThere was a time in Thebes, my dears, Athena loved a nymph, loved her to distraction, loved her more than any other, the mother of Teiresias, Chariclo by name, and was never apart from her. When Athena drove her horses towards ancient Thespiae or towards Coroneia or to Haliartus, riding through the farmlands of the Boeotians - or toward Coroneia where her grove is heavy with incense, and her altars lie close to the river Curalius - often did the Goddess set the nymph upon her car and there was no dalliance of nymphs nor sweet ordering of dance, where Chariclo did not lead. \\n\\nYet even Chariclo did many tears await \nAnswer: Sure is confusing.\n\nAnswer:",

We do have retirement homes that are available to members and their wives, but they are not free.  They still cost money, although some of the cost may be subsidized by the fraternity.\\n\\nDepending on a lodge's location, there are also many family activities available such as theater and ballgame tickets, and many other activities to encourage family activity.\\n\\nIf you want to know more, you can email me or you can contact your local Masonic lodge, but remember that people do not join Freemasonry in order to get access to benefits.  People join because they are interested in community service, charity, history, and becomeing better men.\n\nAnswer:",

Do you mean when the planet itself is utterly disintegrated? Are you referring to a Biblical apocalypse?\\n\\nTo any of these conditions, no one can say. However, to the first one listed, our continued destruction of the environment continues to lead to more polluted air, ground, and water. And, while the melting of the ice caps will raise water a great deal and wipe out coastal cities and land, it certainly can't cover the entire planet. Stubborn as humans are, we'll probably find some way to survive through technology if we mess things up that badly, which would be extremely sad to have destroyed such beauty. We also might start a nuclear war that kills everything but cockroaches, but the planet itself would still be here. \\n\\nCondition two, where the planet is disintegrated, could be brought about by several ways, as well. A large comet, asteroid, or meteor might smash into earth, breaking it apart and causing it to no longer technically be a planet. When the sun finally goes nova (estimated to be 5 billion years away), if it reaches this far out, which his possible, it would swallow the earth, likely blowing it to bits. Then there's always the \"Hitchhiker's Guide\" route, where we'll be destroyed for an intergalactic highway.\\n\\nAs for the Bible, only the Father knows. Not even Christ knows when it'll happen. People have been incorrectly interpreting the signs for hundreds of years, so all the tabloid doomsday people are probably just as wrong now.\\n\\nIn short, no one can see the future, and you're right. We don't take good care of our planet. We really should appreciate it more while we still have a planet to enjoy! Who knows, tomorrow someone might throw a nuke, so go out and enjoy earth! And just in case someone doesn't start World War III, go and take care of it, too, so that generations far into the future can look back on this time and say, \"Wow, look at all they did for their children and their children's children,\" instead of, \"How on earth could they be so selfish and uncaring?\"\n\nAnswer:",

He was born on January 26, 1880 in Little Rock Barracks, Arkansas. He died on April 5, 1964. He's best known as the American general who said \"I shall return.\"\\n\\nHe was one of the most popular and accomplished U.S. military leaders of the 20th century, known primarily for commanding Allied forces in the southwest Pacific during World War II. MacArthur graduated first in his class from West Point Academy (1903) and a few months later was sent to the Philippines, where he worked as an aide to his father, General Arthur MacArthur, Jr. After an illustrious career in World War I, Douglas served in the Philippines as major general (1922-25), commanded the Department of the Philippines (1928-30) and served in the U.S. as chief of staff of the Army (1930-35). In 1935 he was again sent to the Philippines to organize defenses in preparation for their independence. In 1937 he retired from the Army rather than leave his Philippine project uncompleted, but he was recalled to active duty when it became clear that war with Japan was imminent (1941). Overrun by Japanese forces at Bataan, MacArthur was ordered by President Franklin Roosevelt to withdraw to Australia. Before MacArthur and his family escaped, he made the famous vow, \"I shall return.\" In 1942 he was made the supreme commander of Allied forces in the southwest Pacific and by 1945 had liberated the Philippines on the way to invading Japan. MacArthur accepted the Japanese surrender in Tokyo Bay on 2 September 1945, then led the occupation forces in the reconstruction of Japan. After North Korea invaded South Korea in 1950, MacArthur was put in charge of United Nations forces and successfully drove the invaders back. His enthusiasm for pushing on and attacking areas of China was not shared by President Harry Truman, who relieved MacArthur of his command in 1951. Still considered a national hero, MacArthur gave a famous address to Congress and retired. Flamboyant and confident, MacArthur has been called arrogant and egotistical, but his amphibious campaigns in World War II and in Korea are considered brilliant examples of military strategy.\\n\\nMacArthur is often cited as the source of the quote: \"Old soldiers never die, they just fade away.\" He said it in his speech before Congress, but prefaced the quote by saying that it was from one of the popular \"barrack ballads\" he had heard as a cadet at West Point.\n\nAnswer:",

Red flowers have genotype RR, pink Rr or rR, and white rr. \\n\\nYou count the number of each kind of flower. It turns out there are 150 red-flowered plants, 480 pink, and 170 white ones. \\n\\nTherefore there are 2*(150+480+170) = 1600 alleles out there. There are 300 Rs in the red plants, 480 in the pink ones and 0 in the white. Added together there are 780. 780/1600 = 0.4875, so the frequency of the R allele is 48.75%\\n\\nAs for the r allele, there are 0 in the red-flowered plants, 480 in the pink, and 340 in the white. Added together, there are 820. 820/1600 is 51.25%.\\n\\nAs a double check, 48.75% + 51.25% = 100%\n\nAnswer:",

This could be arranged at a very young age, and the propective husbands could be much older, very ugly or even mad.  Many mediaeval English kings married French or Spanish princesses.\\n\\nAs for what they did in their daily life, they would probably have learnt music and tapestry-work; some would have been well-educated, but others would have had parents who considered reading, writing and mathematics useless for girls whose future jobs would be primarily to provide heirs.  \\n\\nSlightly later than the Middle Ages: Henry VIII married Anne of Cleves, who had hardly any education at all; his daughter by Anne Boleyn, Elizabeth I, was extremely intelligent and well-educated, as were other girls of the aristocracy.\\n\\nI would guess there are some good websites on the subject.  Try typing in keywords such as: Medieval (US spelling!) Education, or Education in Royal Courts - and your dates.\n\nAnswer:",

They believe we are obligated to celebrate ALL the OT cerimonies and festvals.  Is this biblical that we are suppose to be under the OT Jewish Law?  PLEASE ONLY SERIOUS ANSWERS ONLY!  Can anyone give a Biblical answer of what God says in His Word?  Thanks and GOd Bless\nAnswer: I think that nobody really knows, with certainty, what God wants us to do. A good thing would be to pray for guidance and follow your concience. For some reason, I feel that after Jesus came on earth, that we are supposed to follow the New Testament and not the Old Testament. I hope this helps.\n\nAnswer:",

I think they are a side with real heart and terrific team spirit.  If the tournament were being played at altitude I would give them a chance to advance.\\n\\nHowever, the problem for them is that all games are at sea level.  Ecuador has a terrific record at Estadio Atahualpa in Quito, but their record at sea level is not particularly impressive.  I think in their qualifying campaign they only won one away match (and that was in LaPaz, Bolivia -altitude 10,000 ft).  They couldn't even beat Venezuela away from home.\\n\\nThe Germans are at home, so you have to favour them.  Beating a team from next door (Poland) at sea level will be very tough.  I'd give them a chance against Costa Rica, but that won't be sufficient to see them through to the knockout phase.\\n\\nHowever, I think Antonio Valencia and Franklin Sales will emerge as quality players during the tournament.\n\nAnswer:",

She knows I have the biggest crush on her.....\nAnswer: Wrong?  That's for you to decide, but here's some food for thought.\\n\\nShe needs your friendship.  If you give her friendship without going for anything more right now, it shows her respect.  Then, when she is less vulnerable, if the two of you get together she will respect you more and you will be able to trust that she's with you for the right reasons and not simply out of need.\\n\\nIf the two of you got involved right now, it might be for the wrong reasons at the wrong time and thus set you up for failure down the road.\\n\\nIf you are \"right\" together, then it won't hurt for you to be her best friend and hold off on the other stuff for a while out of respect for her temporary vulnerability and genuine love or care for her.\\n\\nJust something to consider.

My friends told me it would an I wanted to make sure befor I buy one.\nAnswer: Ok, on top of what everyone else has already said, you need to know your local hunting laws. In some areas it is ILLEGAL to hunt deer with a 410. You need to research the hunting laws in your area. As for its effectiveness: you have an approximately 110 grain 45cal. (about) slug, fired from a shotgun shell at 1,700 ft per second, with a muzzle energy of around 770 ft/pounds of energy........ more than enough to kill a deer if you hit the vital area. I'd still prefer a larger caliber just for the extra impact energy (my .20 ga. gives well over 2000 ft/pounds muzzle energy), but that's simply my preference.\n\nAnswer:",

The average seek time of a hard drive is around 8 milliseconds (how long it takes to find a file).  Considering that a computer can process stuff in the area of several billionths of a second (aka nanoseconds), the hard drive is much too slow to provide things for the cpu to process.  The purpose of RAM is to store data so it can be accessed faster than the hard drive.  RAM can work in a microsecond range, so it makes the computer that much faster.  The more RAM you have, the less often your computer must go to your hard drive.  \\n\\nThere is also what's called cache on your CPU (pronounced \"cash\") which further holds information before it gets processed.  The cache can work in the nanosecond range just like the processor.  \\n\\nThink of it this way:  Think of a carpenter as the CPU, think of his tool belt as the cache.  The carpenter can work faster if his tools are ready to use in his tool belt, however he can't carry that much in it.  It's because of this that he keeps most of his tools in his truck.  He can go to his truck to change which tools he has in his tool belt, but it's slower than if he has it right there.  This is why getting a CPU with as much cache as possible will result in a much faster machine.\\nCarrying on, it is a fact of life that you can only fit a limited amount of stuff in your truck, so you have to go to the hardware store to pick up more things.  Going to the hardware store is slow, and is much like having to go get data from the hard drive.  It is because of this that adding more RAM (buying a bigger truck, or adding a trailer) will certainly result in a faster computer.\\n\\nI hope this analogy helps you understand more about RAM and cache and the lot.\n\nAnswer:",

Then just do a little research on that product like history of the product and company. After that set up your projected sales for a month.

From there set up your web site and be sure to use power words that sale in your product description and advertising.\n\nAnswer:",

It is not enough to just do a treatment on a child.  She needs to be much more through in her efforts to rid her house of lice.  \\nI prefer natural treatments, but for something this severe she needs to use chemicals like Rid or Nix.  In addtion to followng all the directions, she needs to bag up the bedding and hats, coats, throw pillows and stuffed toys for at least two weeks!!  She should also get a house spray and spray the carpets, couches, and mattresses.  \\nIt is a lot of work, but you can't drop the ball on this, or you will have a recurring infestation.\\nTo prevent future head infestations, she should have her family use a tea tree oil shampoo...Sally Beauty has a generic version of the Paul Mitchell brand that is great!\n\nAnswer:",

But their defense has a hard time stopping the run. If you take Mannings options away, it forces the colts to run the ball more than they like to. \\n\\nCowboys have the tools to put away the colts but they don't seem to be focused at times.

Isn't that a personal thing.  Why do \"gay\" people feel they have to \"come out of the closet?\", discuss their sex life, etc to the media?  Maybe all the \"straight\" people should start publicly speaking on their sex life?\nAnswer: You are so right - a person's sexual orientation should not matter.\\n\\nAs for coming out of the closet - most of the time the gays are simply doing the same thing that straights do all the time: talking about thier family and/or loved ones. When we are talking about media stars - it seems the public has an interest in who is dating/marrying who, etc. Should they only ask those questions to straights? Should gays have to lie when asked these questions?\\n\\nStop and think about a typical Monday conversation - talking about what you did over the weekend and usually who you did it with. How it is somehow wrong for a gay man to say that he and his partner went out to dinner and a movie Saturday night but ok for a straight man to say he and his wife did? Do you want the gay man to lie and say he and his \"roommate\" went so that you will feel more comfortable?  \\n\\nIt's not like being gay is only about sex - like everyone else - sex is only about 10% of a person/relationship. I'd rather focus in on the other 90% of a person.  I just don't get what all the fuss is about - being gay is not contagious.\n\nAnswer:",

At 11, the media was mistakenly informed that the hostages had been saved and the news was announced to a relieved Israeli public. Almost an hour later, however, new fighting broke out and one of the helicopters holding the Israelis was blown up by a terrorist grenade. The remaining hostages in the second helicopter were shot to death by one of the surviving terrorists.\\n\\nAt 3 a.m., a drawn and teary-eyed Jim McKay, who had been reporting the drama throughout the day as part of ABC's Olympic coverage, announced: \"They're all gone.\"\\n\\nFive of the terrorists were killed along with one policeman, and three were captured. A little over a month later, on Oct. 29, a Lufthansa jet was hijacked by terrorists demanding that the Munich killers be released.\\n\\nThe Germans capitulated and the terrorists were let go, but an Israeli assassination squad was assigned to track them down along with those responsible for planning the massacre. According to George Jonas in Vengeance: The True Story of an Israeli Counter-Terrorist Team, eight of the 11 men targeted for death were killed. Of the remaining three, one died of natural causes and the other two were assassinated, but it is not known for sure if they were killed by Israeli agents.\n\nAnswer:",

The Catskills are a portion of this plateau which simply \"refused to go along.\" Their bedrock refused to \"buckle\". Instead this bedrock rose up by easy stages from the shallow sea in which its rocks (sedimentary?) had been formed (deposited?) from ancient mountains to the east. Raised high in the air the plateau became easy prey to the cutting action of the streams which carried off the plateau's rainwater. The plateau was carved up over 100's of thousands of years...the tough, hardest parts remained while the softer material was disposed of by various erosion techniques and actions including frost, water action and wind. Geologists explain the Catskills are simply a tough part of the Allegheny Plateau which the streams, even with the help of frost and gravity have not yet cut down to size. Over vast geologic time, of course, these forces will do away with the whole thing. In the meantime, scientifically speaking, the Catskills should be described as 'a maturely dissected part of the Allegheny Plateau\".\n\nAnswer:",

I would say there will be opportunities taken by others if they feel the world's forces are stretched a little thin.\n\nAnswer:",

My best time now is 5;19?\nAnswer: Well as you may know, you have to train probly 5-6 times a week. Cutting 19 seconds off your time is going to take some time and patience. You should do a few runs of 4-5 miles, a long run of about 6-7 miles, and a few track workouts each week. Examples of track workouts could be 8-10 400m runs, 15 200m runs, or possibly 6 or 7 800m runs. If you do 400m, try to do them at about 75 seconds each, 2-3 minute rest. 200m should probly be around 30-33 seconds and 800m around 2:20-2:25. Change your track workout each week, like do 400's one week and maybe 800's the next. Hope that helped!!\n\nAnswer:",

Born in 1881, in the early 1900s, he came to believe the Ottoman Empire was in need of radical reform.  He joined forces with two other 'Young Turks' (a group of army officers who wanted to modernise the administration of the Ottoman Empire).  As a result of the rebellion, the incumbent Sultan, Abdul Hamid, was deposed in 1909.\\n\\nOn the outbreak of the First World War in 1914, Pasha (having aligned himself with Germany and Austria-Hungary) became Minister for War and when Turkey was defeated in 1918, he fled to Turkestan.\\n\\nEnver Pasha died in 1922 at the age of 41, whilst leading an anti-Bolshevik revolt in Turkestan.\n\nAnswer:",

Some plants have an analogous system: the vascular system in vascular plants; trumpet hyphae in bryophytes.\\n\\nRoot hairs are thin-walled extensions of the epidermal cells in roots. They provide increased surface area and thus more efficient absorption of water and minerals. Water and dissolved mineral nutrients enter the plant via two routes. \\n\\n\\nWater and selected solutes pass through only the cell membrane of the epidermis of the root hair and then through plasmodesmata on every cell until they reach the xylem: intracellular route (apoplastic). Water and solutes enter the cell wall of the root hair and pass between the wall and plasma membrane until the encounter the endodermis, a layer of cells that they must pass through to enter the xylem: extracellular route (symplastic). \\n\\n\\nThe endodermis has a strip of water-proof material (containing suberin) known as the Casparian strip that forces water through the endodermal cell and in such a way regulates the amount of water getting to the xylem. Only when water concentrations inside the endodermal cell fall below that of the cortex parenchyma cells does water flow into the endodermis and on into the xylem.\\nXylem and Transport \\nXylem is the water transporting tissue in plants that is dead when it reaches functional maturity. Tracheids are long, tapered cells of xylem that have end plates on the cells that contain a great many crossbars. Tracheid walls are festooned with pits. Vessels, an improved form of tracheid, have no (or very few) obstructions (crossbars) on the top or bottom of the cell. The functional diameter of vessels is greater than that of tracheids.\\n\\nWater is pulled up the xylem by the force of transpiration, water loss from leaves. Mature corn plants can each transpire four gallons of water per week. Transpiration rates in arid-region plants can be even higher. Water molecules are hydrogen bonded to each other. Water lost from the leaves causes diffusion of additional water molecules out of the leaf vein xylem, creating a tug on water molecules along the water columns within the xylem. This \"tug\" causes water molecules to rise up from the roots to eventually the leaves. The loss of water from the root xylem allows additional water to pass throught the endodermis into the root xylem.\\n\\nCohesion is the ability of molecules of the same kind to stick together. Water molecules are polar, having slight positive and negative sides, which causes their cohesion. Inside the xylem, water molecules are in a long chain extending from the roots to the leaves. \\n\\nAdhesion is the tendency of molecules of different kinds to stick together. Water sticks to the cellulose molecules in the walls of the xylem, counteracting the force of gravity and aiding the rise of water within the xylem. \\n\\nCohesion-Adhesion Theory\\nTranspiration exerts a pull on the water column within the xylem. The lost water molecules are replaced by water from the xylem of the leaf veins, causing a tug on water in the xylem. Adhesion of water to the cell walls of the xylem facilitates movement of water upward within the xylem. This combination of cohesive and adhesive forces is referred to as the Cohesion-Adhesion Theory.\\n\\n\\nGuard Cells Regulate Transpiration\\nIn most environments, the water concentration outside the leaf is less than that inside the leaf, causing a loss of water through openings in the leaf known as stomata (singular = stoma). Guard cells are crescent-shaped cells of the epidermis that flank the stoma and regulate the size of the opening. Together, the guard cells and stoma comprise the stomatal apparatus. The inner wall of the guard cell is thicker than the rest of the wall. When a guard cell takes up potassium ions, water moves into the cell, causing the cell to become turgid and swell, opening the stoma. When the potassium leaves the guard cell, the water \n\nAnswer:",

Is it better than what I currently have which is a hyper prostaff 6.1 95.\nAnswer: This is really a matter of preferance, they are both good frames.  I have used the Wilson 6.1 classic prostaff for years and it is comparable to the two frames you have listed.  The hyper prostaff will have a slightly larger sweetspot with the larger head size, but I have heard good things about the ncode six-one tour.  Another racket to consider which I have recently played with is the Head liquidmetal prestige red frame.  It has a denser string pattern but suprisingly generates a generous amount of spin.  Actually it took me about 3 days of hitting before i really started liking the Head Prestige, but it was time well spent.  You may want to change to the n-code for no other reason except the hyper prostaff could be discontinued in the near future.  Anyways, good luck with your choice.\n\nAnswer:",

I'm a registered nurse, and I just found out a few months back that a fellow coworker was on a working visa and is getting paid significantly less than I am.\\n\\nI heard her story, but in my mind I was thinking that's the way it is. Nurses are not cheap, and hospitals are just taking advantage of the situation.  It works for both sides. The immigrant nurse gets to work here and enjoy the freedom, while hospitals can provide competent care to their patients through these immigrant nurses.\\n\\nCommon practice.

The defect allows blood to flow from one atrium to the other, usually from the left side to the right side. This causes extra blood flow:\\n\\nIn the right atrium \\nIn the right ventricle \\nTo the lungs \\n\\n\\nFigure A shows the normal anatomy and blood flow of the interior of the heart. Figure B shows a heart with an atrial septal defect, which allows oxygen-rich blood from the left atrium to mix with oxygen-poor blood from the right atrium. \\n\\nIn a normal heart, oxygen-poor (blue) blood returns from the body to the right atrium. From the right atrium, the blue blood flows to the right ventricle\u2014one of the two lower chambers of the heart\u2014and is pumped to the lungs to pick up oxygen. After traveling through the lungs, the blood is now oxygen-rich and red. The red blood returns from the lungs to the left atrium and goes to the left ventricle, where it is pumped to the body. The right and left sides of the heart are normally completely separated by the septum. The septum keeps the blue blood from mixing with the red blood. The later section \"How the Heart Works\" explains the process in greater detail.\\n\\nASD is the second most common congenital heart defect.\\n\\nMore than 3,000 babies are born with ASD each year in the United States. \\nASD occurs twice as often in girls as in boys. \\nEffects of Atrial Septal Defect\\nOver time, the extra blood flow to the right side of the heart and the lungs can cause:\\n\\nEnlargement of the right atrium and the right ventricle. \\nRight heart overload. The right side of the heart has to work harder to pump extra blood to the lungs, especially as resistance in the pulmonary (PULL-mun-ary) artery increases. Over time, the heart may become overworked, and function may become impaired. This is exceedingly rare with modern methods of diagnosis and treatment. \\nIrregular heartbeats or rhythms (arrhythmias). Extra blood flowing into the right atrium through the ASD can cause the atrium to stretch and enlarge. When this occurs, a fast heartbeat can develop with symptoms such as dizziness, fainting, or chest discomfort. \\nStroke. Occasionally a blood clot in a vein or in the right side of the heart can pass through the ASD and enter the blood stream, where it can block an artery supplying the brain and cause a stroke. \\nPulmonary artery hypertension. This is when high blood pressure exists in the arteries that carry blood to the lungs. The extra blood being pumped to the lungs can increase the pressure in the pulmonary arteries. Over time, high pressure can damage the arteries and the small blood vessels in the lungs. They thicken and become stiff, making it harder for blood to flow through them (pulmonary vascular disease). \\nUsually, most of these effects don\u2019t show up until adulthood, often around age 30 or later. They are rare in infants and children.\\n\\nCharacteristics\\nAn ASD is classified by its size and location.\\n\\nSize\\nThe size of an ASD can range from small to large.\\n\\nMost small defects close on their own as the heart grows during childhood. They usually allow only a small amount of blood to flow between the atria. \\nModerate to large defects are much less likely to close on their own. They allow two or more times the normal amount of blood to flow through the right side of the heart. Large holes sometimes cause symptoms during infancy or childhood. \\nLocation\\nThree major types of ASD exist, based on the location of the defect on the septum:\\n\\nSecundum. This defect is in the middle of the septum. It is the most common form of ASD. About 7 out of every 10 babies born with ASD have this type. This type often closes on its own, unless it is large. \\nPrimum.\n\nAnswer:",

And he's not just a liberal, hes a LIBERAL, big time.  I've researched him.  He's very leftists, so I do think he'll try to appease the islamic countries, and if he must use his religion to gain those means, I don't see that stopping him.  However, he's just one Representative.  In most likelyhood he wont affect foreign affairs whatsoever, and instead just get alot of pork (no pun intended, I swear) for his district like every other Representative tries to do\n\nAnswer:",

In the most basic form, you will need to file a notice of appeal.  In many states, it is up to the appellant to create the record for the court of appeal by designating what documents the trial court clerk should copy and send to the court to the court fo appeal.  The appellant may also need to pay for and arrange for copies of the trial transcript to be availble for the court of appeal.  AFter the record is complete, you must file an opening brief.  The respondent files an opposition brief and you file a reply.  Sometimes the court will hear oral argument.  This is just the BARE basics, so get an attorney right away.\n\nAnswer:",

The \"N\" word should NOT even be in existance any more.\\nI think part of the problem is that there seems to be (correct me if I'm wrong) an attitude in the African American community that it is O.K. for blacks to use this word and to call each other this name (because of the oppression they've faced) but when whites use it, it is obviously not O.K.\\nMy question is why can't we just make the use of this word wrong ALL of the time?  If we don't we only perpetuate this problem.  Example, white boy likes rap, hears the \"N\" word glorified about 40 times in just one song, then your going to tell him not to say this word??\\nAnother example- the word \"groovy\".  It was very popular and cool in the 60's.  Now it is very uncool, and is laughed at in Scooby Doo and Austin Powers flicks.\\nIf we can make this word uncool and not use it in anything it will die. Jackson is right.\nAnswer: Why JUST the \"N\" word?  We \"need\" (please note the quotes) to have words that hurt.  Some people would not be able to speak if they weren't able to deride somebody else in doing so.  Small minds produce small ideas.  The answers lay in the Bible.  IF were were to follow its (God's) word, we would all be treating each other a whole lot better.  God bless.\n\nAnswer:",

How to do so?\nAnswer: I would try to get a very tiny secured loan from the bank.  Maybe $500.  Go to 5 banks and do it.  Next pay all 5 loans back.  Repeat again for a slightly larger amount.  eventually you'll have several loans that show up as borrowed and paid.  This will increase your credit.

Before you start college, make sure you fill out a FAFSA form.

Re-Birth??\nAnswer: Nobody gave a concrete proof.\\nMany scientists too agreed who made studies on it.\\nLET US SEE LOGICALLY.\\nScience says both energy and matter are neither created nor distroyed only they change the forms. Life is a form of energy which has a special capacity to work to attain something it desires to achieve. That means it will catch a new body to complete unfinished tasks.\\nBhagavadgeetha ch.2. Verse 15, says.. \"dEhinoosmin.....\" It means just like one attains youthhood from childhood and then the old age he attains another fresh body after death.\\nch.2. V 22, says - The life force(energy) scraps the old or spoiled body and changes to a new one, similer to a living individual changing the old or unusable dress material to a new one.\\nThere are long and appropriate answers to a few importent questions.\\nWhat controls the next form of birth? (Short answer - The actions, Karma). Is an individual has the choice of next \\nform of birth - Short answer Normally No. But Yes After the  MOKSHA (The deliverence). After Moksha one can choose the form and nature of his next body or birth).\\nThe experience of this life will be passed on to the brain chip of next body just like an e-mail passing from one computer chip thru the WEB to another BRAND NEW COMPUTER, without any dependence of the computer where the mail is originally created. \\nScientifically a freqency perfectly catches another similar frequency, and therefore we can select different channels in Radio and TV. Similarly the life energy will have a certain thought frequency depending on the previous body experience. Therefore it can select the parents of similar matching thought frequencies for its next birth. For example if some one behaves very cruelly like tiger and remains as criminal in the world, and if he never repents his cruel actions, his mind freqiency will match with that of a tiger. After leaving the present body that life energy may select a tiger as its mother because of well matching frequency available there!      \\nEnough for now.\n\nAnswer:",

She was Wu Zetian, the only female in Chinese history to rule as emperor. To some she was an autocrat, ruthless in her desire to gain and keep power. To others she, as a woman doing a \"man's job,\" merely did what she had to do, and acted no differently than most male emperors of her day. They also note that she managed to effectively rule China during one of its more peaceful and culturally diverse periods.\\n\\nThe Tang dynasty (618-906 AD) was a time of relative freedom for women. They did not bind their feet nor lead submissive lives. It was a time in which a number of exceptional women contributed in the areas of culture and politics. So it is no surprise that Wu, born into a rich and noble family, was taught to play music, write, and read the Chinese classics. By thirteen years of age she was known for her wit, intelligence, and beauty, and was recruited to the court of Emperor Tai Tsung. She soon became his favorite concubine. But she also had eyes for his son, Kao Tsung.\\n\\nWhen the emperor died and Kao Tsung took over, Wu was now twenty seven years old. In time she became a favorite concubine of the new emperor, giving birth to the sons he wanted. As mother of the future emperor of China, she grew in power. She managed to eliminate Kao Tsung's wife, Empress Wang, by accusing her of killing Wu's newborn daughter. Kao Tsung believed Wu, and replaced Empress Wang to marry the up and coming Wu Zetian. Within five years of their marriage, Emperor Kao Tsung suffered a crippling stroke. The Empress Wu took over the administrative duties of the court, a position equal to the emperor. She created a secret police force to spy on her opposition, and cruelly jailed or killed anyone who stood in her way, including the unfortunate Empress Wang. With the death of Emperor Kao Tsung, Wu managed to outflank her eldest sons and moved her youngest, and much weaker son, into power. She in effect ruled, telling him what to do.\\n\\nIn order to challenge Confucian beliefs against rule by women, Wu began a campaign to elevate the position of women. She had scholars write biographies of famous women, and raised the position of her mother's clan by giving her relatives high political posts. She moved her court away from the seat of traditional male power and tried to establish a new dynasty. She said that the ideal ruler was one who ruled like a mother does over her children.\\n\\nIn 690, Wu's youngest son removed himself from office, and Wu Zetian was declared emperor of China. In spite of her ruthless climb to power, her rule proved to be benign. She found the best people she could to run the government, and treated those she trusted fairly. She reduced the army's size and stopped the influence of aristocratic military men on government by replacing them with scholars. Everyone had to compete for government positions by taking exams, thus setting the practice of government run by scholars. Wu also was fair to peasants, lowering oppressive taxes, raising agricultural production, and strengthening public works.\\n\\nDuring her reign, Empress Wu placed Buddhism over Daoism as the favored state religion. She invited the most gifted scholars to China and built Buddhist temples and cave sculptures. Chinese Buddhism achieved its highest development under the reign of Wu Zetian.\\n\\nAs she grew older, Empress Wu lessened the power of her secret police. But she become increasingly superstitious and fearful. Sorcerers and corrupt court favorites flattered her. Finally, in 705, she was pressured to give up the throne in favor of her third son, who was waiting all these years in the wings. Wu Zetian died peacefully at age eighty the same year.\n\nAnswer:",

I just need to know the basics, like... what does it eat, where is it found, etc.\\n\\nyannow... the basics\nAnswer: Coelacanths are lobe-finned fish with the pectoral and anal fins on fleshy stalks supported by bones, and the tail fin divided into three lobes, the middle one of which also includes a continuation of the notochord. Coelacanths have modified cosmoid scales, which are thinner than true cosmoid scales, which can only be found on extinct fish. Coelacanths also have a special electroreceptive device called a rosteral organ in the front of the skull, which probably helps in prey detection.\\n\\nCoelacanths first appear in the fossil record in the Middle Devonian, about 390 million years ago. Prehistoric species of coelacanth lived in many bodies of water in Late Paleozoic and Mesozoic times.\\n\\nThe average weight of the coelacanth is 176 pounds (80 kg) and they can reach up to 6.5 feet (2 m) in length. Scientists believe individual coelacanths may live as long as 60 years.\\n\\nThey are the only living species known to have a functional intracranial joint, which almost completely separates the front and back halves of the skull internally. Flexure at this joint may aid in the consumption of large prey. Coelacanths are also mucilaginous; their scales release mucus and their bodies continually exude oil. This oil is a laxative, and makes the fish almost inedible unless dried and salted. Their scales are very rough, and are used by the villagers of the Comoros as sandpaper.\\n\\nCoelacanth eyes are very sensitive, and have a tapetum lucidum. Coelacanths are almost never caught in the daytime or on nights with full moons, due to the sensitivity of their eyes.\\n\\nCoelacanths are opportunistic feeders, hunting cuttlefish, squid, snipe eels, small sharks, and other fish found in their deep reef and volcanic slope habitats. Coelacanths are also known to swim head down, backwards and belly up to locate their prey presumably utilizing its rosteral gland. Scientists suspect that one reason this fish has been so successful is that they can slow down their metabolisms at any time, sinking into the less-inhabited depths and minimizing their nutritional requirements in a sort of hibernation mode.\n\nAnswer:",

Basically a group of messengers came to Earth and bred homo sapiens as workers. After several thousand years, several Nephilim felt enslaving us was wrong, and started to impart their knowledge to us. There was a civil war among the Nephilim regarding the future of mankind. This led to the biblical flood of 4000BC, in which almost all human life was lost, though finally the benevolent Nephilim won and through a fe,ale Nephilim, the human race was created, leading to the view that we are all Gods children, and the opinion that we all contain a small essence of the Divine. They taught us the wisdom of how to grow crops, religion, philosophy etc. This info was largely lost with the rise of the Persians, Babylonians and led to the forgotten knowledge scenario.\\nUruk has been found and its great zigarat (pyramid) remains unexcavated approx 150miles NW of Basra, Iraq, currently occupied by UK troops.\n\nAnswer:",

Sahcha Cohen is now into Andy Kaufman territory.  It is the most brilliant satire since South Park first aired.  He has dragged out all the ugly stereotypes, all of America's ignorance towards the rest of the world, and put it together through the character of a well intentioned foreign man - from a country that most Americans don't even know exists. It is not so much a comedy about foreigners, as it is about what kind of reaction Americans have to foreigners today.  This movie is so important and so ridiculously true to exposing the ugly underbelly of America, at a time when it needs it more than anything.  Self-reflexive satire, that's true and hilariously painful to watch and laugh at. We are laughing at both Borat and Americans - there's only one difference - Sacha Baron Cohen is acting.\n\nAnswer:",

Fine if you think it's gross. I don't exactly see it as something pleasant but to me it's no big deal if that's what someone wants to do, and who's to say it doesn't work? It's something to consider.\\n\\nThere are even more controversial ones, 1 involves pedophilia. I'm not going to attempt to explain it because some people on here are just far too immature to grasp what the idea suggests and will immediately write OMGS WRONG!11 sick mofo!!\\nWhen I first heard the theory I didn't freak out. I don't condone certain things or even agree with them but I can see where they're coming from.\\n\\nWhat is open-mindedness really? Are you truely? Am I..hmm\nAnswer: Open mindedness is a very personal thing. One person decides how much he/she will accept/tolerate from others. I call myself open minded because i live by my motto, basically live and let live! You mention people drinking their own urine ... Well they can well do it as much as they like just as long as they don't expect me to follow suit! You mention peadophiles and have to realise that some people may well have been abused or their children have in which case such people would never accept peadophiles, let alone tolerate them! \\n\\nI think you'll find that most people's degrees of tolerance/acceptance vary depending on their upbringing, primary socialisation, life circumstances. Picture yourself coming home after a bad at work, a really sore head to hear your kids playing rave music on full blast ... You wouldn't tolerate it if, at other times, you might actually enjoy it!\\n\\nI am a registered mental health nurse and have worked with categories of people the vast majority of us would never wish to associate with under normal circumstances, some of the patients included peadophilesand worse ... As a nurse it was my duty to treat anyone the same, regardless of what they had done (Be it alleged pending trial or proven) And i did it because it was what i did! This doesn't mean to say that i approved of what they had done (Alleged to have done) because other patients were in the ward following crimes perpetrated against them ... Same crimes these people were in for a psychiatric assessment! But it didn't reflect on my care and the way i spoke to them.  \\n\\nMy interpretation of open mindedness is that, and no matter how our own perception/values affect our judgement ... Not to let it show and treat people the same if privately we may feel that we do not condone what a person did!\n\nAnswer:",

So the moist wind gets obstracted there, which causes a snowfall in high altitudes & rainfall in lower altitudes. The north west monsoon mainly causes the snowfall as it comes from cold Middle east.The obstraction of this NEM causes snowfall in Kashmir & Simla.\\n\\nWestern Ghats are not as high as the Himalayas. Moreover when the NEM arrives in Western Ghats, they have already lost the last traces of moisture that they contained. \\n\\nThat is why snowfall does not occur in Ooty.\n\nAnswer:",

If the child has special needs (which also includes gifted children) that the school system is not handling properly, then certainly homeschooling is an option.  If the school is teaching things the parents would rather the child not learn, or conversely, the public school is NOT teaching things the parents feel their child should know about, then homeschool is an option.  However, it requires a great deal of commitment, as well as time, energy, and effort on the part of the parents to do it well - you can't just set some workbooks in front of your child and say, \"Do pages 41-45.\"  \\n\\nAs far as socialization is concerned, that is only an issue if the parent makes it one by not allowing their child to interact with others in the world around them.  The homeschool kids I know are all very sociable and able to relate to those who are both older and younger.  My own kids have many friends, both within the homeschool community and without (in public school).\\n\\nIn the end, it comes down to personal preference.\n\nAnswer:",

She has become very self-centered. For example she interrupts EVERYONE who is talking to talk about herself. Once she interrupted one friend\u2019s story to tell all how she straitened her hair. The story didn\u2019t go anywhere and everyone was left confused. Another example is at her birthday party she rapidly opened one gift and then tossed it aside without saying thank you. Then screamed \u201cMore\u201d and held out her hands. She also has become so boy obsessed that it interferes with her normal life. For example she follows one boy around school constantly. She even stole his favorite jacket. My other friends have also noticed the dramatic changes in her too. I want to salvage our friendship but she seems too far gone. Do you think it is worth it? Do you think she can really change?\nAnswer: give it a try. it's worth that much. brace yourself though. it does sound like she's far gone. tell her what you feel. she might blow you off but that will make it easier for you to move on. \\n\\ngood luck.\n\nAnswer:",

Although we believe thwat we will be together for the rest of our lives, he doesnt believe in marriage, so it wont go that way for us.... and no, I dont think that true love does break; it may evolve, alter or even fade with the years, but they will always be your true love.\n\nAnswer:",

There is no chamber length stamped on the barrel.\nAnswer: Bound's hubby here: \\n\\nExpect that your Springfield double is chambered for 2.75\" 12 guage shells. Twelve guage shells were also once offered in 2 9/16\" length, but the chances your shotgun is chambered for these shells is really slim ... about equal to you having Osama Bin Laden at your dining room table for Thanksgiving dinner!\\n\\nEDITED TO ADD! Do NOT drop a 3\" shell into a 2 3/4\" chamber, this will give you a false indication! Shotgun chambers are cut long, because the folded \"crimp\" opens up into the chamber extension. If this did not happen, the shot and wad would be constricted as it passes into the barrel, increasing chamber pressure to the point that you are risking a blow-up of your barrel! If you use the \"drop test\" and see that a 3\" shell falls into the chamber, and you use a 3\" Magnum (the only 3\" shell), you are not only risking destruction of your shotgun, but also risking bodily harm!\\n\\nGood luck!\n\nAnswer:",

Each mineral is composed of a specific molecular compound, and those molecules arrange themselves in an ordered fashion based on their structure that will form a crystal.  \\n\\nThese regular and repeating groups of molecules and atoms form a unit that is known as a lattice. There are 14 lattice groups (Bravais lattices), which fall into six (some crystallographers use seven) different crystal systems. Each crystal system includes the different rotation and reflection symmetries around a fixed lattice point. \\n\\nTo make this all more confusing, and to the horror of most mineralogy students there are also 32 different crystal classes. Each crystal class is a different and unique set of symmetrical forms.\\n\\nTo see illustrations of Bravais Lattices go here:\\nhttp://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/solids/bravais.html\\n\\nFor a more detailed explanation go here:\\nhttp://dave.ucsc.edu/myrtreia/crystal.html#INTRO\n\nAnswer:",

(Please answer and read the question below)?\nQuestion: WHat is the difference between light dispersion, light refraction, light diffraction, and light reflection? What is another property besides diffraction, dispersion, refraction, and reflection? Please give a scientific answer.\nAnswer: All these produce a change in path of incident ray of light but reasons and effects are different in each:\\n\\nDiffraction -- bending of light round the edges and corners, while passing through slits/holes/wires in the same medium. produces a pattern of alternate bands/fringes ( minimum/maximum intensity). they are maximum intense at the center of the path and fades of - on both the sides\\nshape of bands/fringes depends on the shape of obstacle(hole/slit/wire/edge)\\n\\nRefraction -  bending of light , when it passes from one medium to another of a different refractive index, no pattern produced. no change in the intensity if the second medium does not reflect/absorb part of incident light.\\n\\nReflection: Change of path of light ray due to reflection, i.e the reflected ray is in the same medium as the second medium simply does neither absorbs nor allows it to pass through it. No change in the intensity and no pattern produced.\\n\\ndispersion -  splitting of incident lightray into its constituent wavelengths, when it passes through a medium (like prism). every wavelength gets deviated from incident path through a different angle (angle of dispersion), hence you can see different colors of visible light.\n\nAnswer:",

Bottom line, Washington does not have anybody who can stop LeBron, but at the same time the Cavs dont play any defense. Washington beat Cleveland 3 out of 4 times they played in the regular season, but the Cavs have played very well down the stretch. The real question is...Can the Cavs win on the road in Washington? They have played pretty bad on the road this season and will really need to step it up in order to advance against a pretty good team in The Washington Wizards. I think offensively Washington is better than Cleveland considering that Cleveland only has 2 real scores who actually get more then 5-7 chances to touch the ball and they are Hughes and LeBron. Illguaskas is the guy who needs to be given the ball more, and needs to score when he gets it. I think if he touches the ball 10-14 times a game, while making between 6-9 of those shots the Cavs will advance to the 2nd round. Washington has nobody who can stop him due to the fact that they dont have a very good big man in Brendan Haywood. The Cavs advance, but they are playing 6 to do it. 4-2 and the Cavs win the series.\n\nAnswer:",

The total ROV system is comprised of the vehicle, which is connected to the control van and the operators on the surface by an umbilical cable, a handling system to control the cable dynamics, a launch system (such as the A-frame shown in the photo to the right) and associated power supplies. The umbilical carries the power and the command and control signals to the vehicle and the status and sensory data back to the operators topside. In many cases, the umbilical includes additional strength members to allow recovery of heavy devices or wreckage.\n\nAnswer:",

Currently I am running against two wealthy candidates in the Democratic Primary for State Representative in Michigan's 68th District.If they win people will get more of the same i.e. everything for special interest groups, nothing for the middle class and poor. As I do not have the money for advertising I need you to advertise to your friends and family especially if your from Michigan. Please visit and tell them to visit my website at\\nhttp://www.melissasuerobinson.homestead.com or donate.\nAnswer: You need to target big money contributors.  Forget about the small campaign contributions and get the big spenders who will donate the maximum amounts they can.  Go for businesses, PACs, and 527s.\\n\\nThose should be the main target of fundraising.  You will need to spend time on the individual voters, but do not expect them to fund your race, you will never make it.\\n\\nAlso, don't expect to win the first time.  And if you are facing an opponent who has a ton more money than you, don't be scared off.  People actually do vote for the person who will do the best job, but you do have to have enough money to inform them about yourself.\n\nAnswer:",

No one would listen if it was just happy fluff all the time, because no one cares about the good stuff. 99 percent of the time, it's about soldiers that have died for our country, and it's happening every day. Apparently republicans don't think that is important enough to make the news and that you're bias if you report it? Geez, you guys are so sensitive to critisism of your president, yet gave it out to Clinton so well?\nAnswer: Because the Republicans need as many excuses as possible to try to turn the numbers game back into their direction.  The public is catching on to the debauchery and the news is taking it and running.  Maybe it is a good thing..I don't think the American people believe anything any of them have to say.

It wasn't there yesterday and this morning it was coating everything.  My brother noticed it on his car in nearby Clarence.  Our best guess is that it may be pollen, but I've never seen so much pollen in the air that everything gets a total coating over night.  Anybody know more about this?\nAnswer: Pollen--most likely from some kind of tree in your area.\\n\\nPollen is the male half of the reproductive system in trees--and it is released in immense quantities, carried about by wind, insects, and other creatures to pollenate other flowers.\\n\\nYou're just having a \"good\" year for pollen.  I'm willing to speculate that one or more sort of tree has had an exceptionally good year for flowering.  Pollen comes from the stamen in the flower--which is the male part of the flower.\\n\\nHope that helps some\n\nAnswer:",

Be careful while doing this exercise because it is dangerous. Another option which is safer is to practice with ankle weights so your body gets used to the extra weight and then remove the weights for a game and see what happens. \\nThe best way to gain hieght is to work witha trainer who can design a program to fit your body size and needs.\n\nAnswer:",

I feel sad and upset most of the time.  \\n\\nNothing has worked out in my life and I feel like a total failure to the point where I did not want to spend Thanksgiving with family and friends that invited me.  They tried to reach out to me and I pulled back and could not return the feelings. \\n\\nI keep hoping that when I wake up in the morning one day I will feel strong and refreshed.  I do plan to see a therapist, but don't know how much help that will be. \\n\\nI am working at a job that I do not like but at least it gives me somewhere to go each day.  My child is living with my ex-husband and missing me. \\n\\nI don't feel like eating and really doing anything at all.  I try meditating, but can only do it for 10 minutes or so.  I do exercise as often as possible, but that has a limited effect. \\n\\nWhen will this sad, blue feeling end? I don't like being depressed.\nAnswer: Well chances are your not going to just wake up one morning and feel better.  You really need to talk to a doctor, either your family doctor or a psychiatrist.  A therapist is good but your probably going to need medication to help you get thought this.  Pulling away from family and friends is not healthy you need to socialize.  Unless you see all of your concerns and problems ending for the better this is going to drag on until you help yourself.  Make an appointment today and get on the road to recovery.  Hope this helps.

Please know that I am only asking this because I support US efforts to liberate Iraq, and truly wish for you to be a free people...and to service men and women...thanks for all you do\nAnswer: though i am not iraqi,but my mother is and i lived  in iraq till i left it last year more than 40 years,but i think i have the right to answer you.\\n1. the war has almost totally destroyed the country.iraq was the jewel of the middle east,now it is a heap of garbage.it is the richest country in the whole world.now its people have the the rank of the 5th poorest country.in the 80,s iraq imported 3 million egyptian workers,now the unemployment is 80%.iraq who is floating on oil is importing gas,kerocine and disel.their prices have jumped 20 folds in 6 mounthes.\\n2.from whom was iraq libreated.it was a sovrign independent country since 1921,it is now under occupation.if you think that removing saddam from power is the lebriation of the country,then i suggest you read a criditable book about the deserting army soldeir who by miracle claimbed to the chair of the vice president in 1968 without any qualifications or any service in the government,accept being a gangister,when he was at the age of 29.who was behind him..\\n3.there were more than 15 attempts of assasinations and coups by the iraqi army and diffrent people sectores against saddam.who used to warn him,and give him full informations.\\n4. wasnt easier and much less costlier to assasinate him since his regime was badly decaying instead of sheding blood from both side with these astronomical figures of us dollars.the proof for that is the us army faced no resistance in invading the country,had the regimn not decayed,the casualties would have been immence.the iraqis are known to be stubborn fighters,\\n5.i wish that those who speak of the rebuilding of iraq give the names of the hospitals,roads,electric power stations,schools,water purifying plants ,and the locations of these new projects.otherwise why the electricity is much worse than it was before the war,till now.\\n5.no one dosent like the democracy,but every culture has its own way of democracy.dont forget that iraq has 10,000 years of accumilated culture behinde it,it isnt easy to impose the american ideals and way of democracy on it in short time. it is natural that it is rejected.yes the iraqies lived black days since 1958,but the occupation made things worse.\\n6.above all there was real security,who dared to kidnap a person before,he would be executed infront of the victims house.noe in the last 3 mounthes the kidnaping rate is 200 persons per day,halfe are wqomen and children.that is one example.who can dare cretisize any official.who can complain anything to any official,where can the officials be found to complain to them.in 1950 my fraind says taha if your phone goes out of service,it would be repaired in one day,now after lebriation it took 15 mounthes and it is not working yet.\n\nAnswer:",

You need to think of yourself as a needle or torpedo in the water.  You want the least resistance as possible so staying straight will make you go faster.  You want to kick from your hips and point your toes.  I used to have a large sissors kick and it only slowed me down.  Other swimmers kept pointing this out to me and I concetrated on keeping my legs together.  You can feel your thighs rub together and let your big toes touch each other each time you kick.  Now that I don't have a big sissors kick and I'm more streamlined I can swim 20 seconds faster for 250 yards.\n\nAnswer:",

In Italy and in Malta, it is sometimes referred to as St. Anthony's fire. It occurs very rarely in children and adults, but its incidence is high in the elderly (over 60), as well as in any age group of immunocompromised patients. It affects some 500,000 people per year in the United States. Treatment is generally with antiviral drugs such as aciclovir. Many patients develop a painful condition called postherpetic neuralgia which is often difficult to manage.\\n\\nIn some patients, herpes zoster can reactivate subclinically with pain in a dermatomal distribution without rash. This condition is known as zoster sine herpete and may be more complicated, affecting multiple levels of the nervous system and causing multiple cranial neuropathies, polyneuritis, myelitis, or aseptic meningitis.\\n\\nThe word herpes comes from the Greek word for snake; it is cognate with herpetology[1].\n\nAnswer:",

And  what can I do to fix it?\nQuestion: I have wireless router on the main computer. My room is right under main pc, I have a laptop. It seems that I get a strong signal but but when I try to upload a page it tells me \"Unavalible to Connect\". I don't know what to do. Because I don't know what's wrong.\nAnswer: You could log onto the routers maintanence page and see wh ois connected to it, and see fi it has a logging function you can use to see who logged on previously.\\n\\nThe best way to stop other people to use it is to change the \"SSID\" name to one only you know, connect up your laptop and the turn \"SSID Broadcast\" to \"off\" so nobody can see yoru signal unless they know what it is called.\\n\\nUsing security like WEP etc. will also help stop unwanted people\n\nAnswer:",

Suppose you choose a marble at random, and do not replace it. Then you choose a second marble. Find the probability of each event.\\n\\n1. You select a green marble then a white marble.\\n\\n2. Both of the marbles you select are green.\nAnswer: Okay...this may get a little confusing. :) \\n\\nThe first thing that you need to do is figure out whether the two event listed in each number are independent of each other or dependent.  In this case, the events are dependent.  For example, if you have these 8 marbles in a bag and you pick a green marble out of it...without replacement you would just set that green marble aside.  Now the chances of getting a green or white marble are different because you have changed the total number, does that make sense?\\n\\nNow, because the events (let's just work with number 1 for example but the same thing can be done to number 2) are dependent, you must use the multiplication rule.  In math terms this says that \"The chance that two things both happen equals the chance that the first happens multiplied by the chance that the second happens pretending the first has happened\".  In simpler terms this just means that you take the chance that the first will happen and multiply it by the chance that the second thing will happen.  \\n\\nSo in number 1, the first one you select is a green marble and the second one is a white marble.  The chances of getting the green marble are 3/8 because there are 3 green marbles and 8 marbles all together.  The chances of getting the white marble second are 5/7.  There are 5 white marbles in the bag, but because you have already taken the green marble out you have changed the total number of marbles - hence the 8 in the denominator changes to a 7...does that make sense?\\n\\nSo your answer to the first one would be (3/8 x 5/7).  I'm not for sure what the numerical answer to that would be, but you can do that calculation on your own! :) \\n\\nThe second problem can be done the same way, except instead of having a white marble second you would have another green marble.\\n\\nI really hope that this helps!! :) :) Good luck! :D\n\nAnswer:",

Also I can't seem to get past his defenses because whenever I try to move his sword out of the way for a stab.  His sword does a small circle and stabs forcing me to withdraw and I assure you that we have equal reach.

I know women that are only 4'11\". Wear heels if you want to be taller. At least you won't be a really tall woman and have to worry about dating a tall guy so that it doesn't look weird or hunch over to talk to my short to average height friends.

For a 3- or 4-year-old toddler, a pillowcase becomes a superhero cape and the cardboard core of a roll of paper towels is used as a trumpet.\\nBy age 4 or 5, a child's ideas and experiences with family and the social world provide material for games like 'house' or 'driving the car.' While some play is solitary or shared with adults, most symbolic play takes place with school peers or neighborhood buddies. Kids this age also adore construction play, building (with toys like Lego or blocks), and rough and tumble play (like ring-around-the-rosy).\n\nAnswer:",

One thing I like about it (over meeting in person right off the bat) is that there is a little more of a safety margin when you first start chatting on the computer  because you're not actually meeting in person.  My usual approach is to correspond and/or chat online for a little while, maybe talk on teh phone a few times (usually a cell phone) before meeting, and then meeting the person if I feel comfortable with her.  (If I don't feel comfortable with her, there will be no meeting, and might not be anything further than a chat or two online).  The first few dates would probably be in a public place, such as a restaurant.\\n\\nAs with meeting people the old fashioned way, you run the risk of meeting good and bad people, but the internet gives you that initial safety margin to make a better informed decision.\n\nAnswer:",

Though quite old, he still was able to defeat any challenger. His reputation extended far and wide throughout the land and many students gathered to study under him.\\nOne day an infamous young warrior arrived at the village. He was determined to be the first man to defeat the great master. Along with his strength, he had an uncanny ability to spot and exploit any weakness in an opponent. He would wait for his opponent to make the first move, thus revealing a weakness, and then would strike with merciless force and lightning speed. No one had ever lasted with him in a match beyond the first move.\\n\\nMuch against the advice of his concerned students, the old master gladly accepted the young warrior's challenge. As the two squared off for battle, the young warrior began to hurl insults at the old master. He threw dirt and spit in his face. For hours he verbally assaulted him with every curse and insult known to mankind. But the old warrior merely stood there motionless and calm. Finally, the young warrior exhausted himself. Knowing he was defeated, he left feeling shamed.\\n\\nSomewhat disappointed that he did not fight the insolent youth, the students gathered around the old master and questioned him. \"How could you endure such an indignity? How did you drive him away?\" \\n\\n\"If someone comes to give you a gift and you do not receive it,\" the master replied, \"to whom does the gift belong?\"\n\nAnswer:",

That sounds great.  Now for the reality check.  Most 'entry level' investment jobs involve lots of phone calls with potential clients.  If you're not 100% adept at phone etiquette, you probably couldn't get that position, and I don't think the technology that you'd be using as a deaf person has yet reached the stage where that would be the case.  So, I think you'd be realistically limited from a lot of the entry level jobs.\\n\\nSince you're effectively barred from those jobs, you're stuck going after the few other entry level jobs in research, etc.  Now for the good news.  Those phone jobs are crappy jobs anyway.  That's where most new college grads get stuck, and it's miserable, and most of them give up within a year.  Instead, you're stuck with the better jobs.  Sure, they're going to be harder to get, cuz there are fewer of them, and many firms aren't organized to take entry level people in any other function.  But this will just assure you that you'll keep looking until you find a good position.  So, with that limitation, yes, it is hard for anyone to get one of those good entry level positions.  You'll just have to persevere.  That's a good thing because you won't make it in the investment world unless you have a lot of perseverence anyway.\\n\\nBy the way, I'd suggest playing to your strengths.  Consider what areas of the investment business you'd be strongest at, and which areas you'd be weakest in, and focus your attention on your strengths.  If you're a good writer and researcher, apply for positions with research firms or publishers.  If you're better at portfolio management, perhaps mutual funds would be a good direction to pursue.  If you're into sales, I suppose I'd look toward the big brokerage firms.  \\n\\nBest of luck to you.\n\nAnswer:",

But I am not using the monitor anymore, so only monitor that I shut off, I am confuse, does it still using the same energy? \\n\\nmany says you can save by shutting the monitor off when u dont use it. \\n\\n\\nplease help me! thanks\nAnswer: surprisingly enough, the monitor actually draws more electricity than a running computer, so if a computer tower and a monitor were the only things on your electricity bill, and you started turning off your monitor more often (such as when you fall asleep to your music...i do the same =P), you'd see a dramatic drop on your next electricity bill =)\n\nAnswer:",

The ones about lowering the freezing point are good, but not quite there. If it just lowered the freezing point (which is true) it would never melt the ice/snow, since it nothing has affected the temperature yet. What happens is that the first interaction of salt and ice/snow (water) causes heat to be released, it is an exothermic reaction. That little bit of heat allows more ice to melt, reacting with more salt, creating more heat, melting more ice, etc. So it is the exothermic reaction that causes the melting, the lower freezing point keeps it from refreezing.\n\nAnswer:",

Merely inserting the CD while running windows will not give you this menu.  \\n\\nMost computers have the ability to boot off cd, but some have this feature disabled.  If you leave the CD in your drive and restart your computer and you get a Press any key to boot from CD message then you're in the clear.  You won't (usually) need to press F6 to add any SCSI controllers and you'll want to do an advanced install, not an upgrade.  From that menu it should give you a screen that lists you partitions and there should be an option to delete the partitions and yes recreate them.  \\n\\nThis is not a trivial task even if you don't have to change your BIOS options to allow CD Booting.  This is not for the faint hearted and while you may want to know how to do this, perhaps it is better that you get someone who has done this to help you through it, like a smart neighbour kid or something.\n\nAnswer:",

As a child it wasnt too bad but it worsened again in after puberty. Anyway eating too much in general or eating the wrong foods can sometimes cause me to be in a lot of pain. Growing up my parents never forced me to finish food because they knew Id get sick and I could never guess when serving myself just how much I could eat. Never the less I never ate alot and now I still eat very little. My BFs family is big on food (russian fam) and they eat a lot. Its also considered rude not to finish your plate. My bfs fam always tries to feed me and if i dont eat they think im being shy or rude. My bf knows about my reflux but its not necessarily common among his family. How do I express I cannot eat more w/o seeming shy or rude? For example we were at his bro bday party and everyone (like 20ppl) seemed offended when I didnt eat but I didnt want to have to sit there and explain what happens when I eat too much.\nAnswer: Keep it simple.\\n\\nSmile, tell the hostess that her meal was delicious. Then place your silverware on your plate to signify you are done eating. If anyone tries to give you more or encourage you to clean your plate, just smile again and very politely tell them that everything was wonderful but you've had more than enough to eat.\n\nAnswer:",

It is lawful for any prospective employer or college to view anything anybody PUBLISHES online.  Putting stuff on myspace is not the same as putting it in a private journal.  The Internet is not private.\\n\\n(The following is from the first link I provided):\\nWhile doing so may be in violation of MySpace agreements, little is done to eliminate groups dedicated to the slandering of racial minorities, and bullying remains a problem. Many schools and public libraries in the US and the UK have begun to restrict access to MySpace because it has become \"such a haven for student gossip and malicious comments\"[7]. Some private schools, particularly those with a religious base, have even attempted to ban their pupils from accessing MySpace at home[8].\\n\\nOn November 7, 2005 only 400 out of 3,000 students of Warren High School in San Antonio, Texas showed up after two male students posted that they were going to bring guns to school. The threat was seen by officials and the students were arrested before anything could happen [9]. Such threats are not uncommon on MySpace. There have been many similar, less-publicized situations involving high-school students making threats that tend to be less serious.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe second link talks about some kids that were arrested for something they put on myspace.  It's just another example to maybe share with your kids.\\n\\n\\n\\nGood luck!\n\nAnswer:",

Firstly, being \"passionate\" about your service/product doesn't necessarily mean that you dream about it night and day and climb onto a couch and bounce around while discussing its merits. It simply means that you convincingly believe that the offering is a valuable one. Realistically you also understand that this value may differ depending upon the needs of your potential clients.\\n\\nAnd so, a sales person may be passionate about Honda's because they realize that a Honda can be an extremely cost efficient and reliable automobile with strong performance for a consumer that values those attributes. However, if the defining attribute that the consumer is looking for is prestige, the Honda sales person will appreciate that a BMW or Mercedes may be a better fit.

We were expecting a couple we know to arrive. So I went to the door without changing. I had on some rubber bondage gear and rubber restraints on my arms which were very tight (I am not into this stuff, I just do it for the wife). \\n\\nI was greated by two mormon missionaries, aged about 20, in suits with bibles in hand.\\n\\nNow My wife and I are tolerant. But as born again christians, my wife and I don\u00b4t want to discuss our faith with those from the Church of the Latter Day Saints. We say live and let live, it\u00b4s just that it is not our thing. \\n\\nThose guys just wouldn\u00b4t leave. They asked to come in. The one on the left looked at me funny. In the end I had to shut the door on them. I didn\u00b4t want to but after fifteen minutes, I was losing the circulation in my arms and could not feel my hands. \\n\\nIs it me, or are these mormon missionaries too pushy?\nAnswer: I know what you mean.  Why just the other day I was in the process of making a burnt offering an ox on the alter that I have erected on my front lawn (To get the Lord to rig the next power ball drawing for me, as per the bible, book of Carbonization, 23-10), when I was accosted by a pair of LDS missionaries.  They actually had the audacity to interrupt my opening benediction to ask if I was interested in their religion, and whats more, their caterwauling frightened the ox, who snapped his restraints and bolted, leaving me with a roaring fire, some very sharp knives, and two belligerent missionaries.\\n\\nAs I am sure you can guess, this sort of threw off my rhythm, and basically ruined the sacrifice.  Whats more, they refused to buy me another ox to sacrifice in place of the one that they had frightened off.  \\n\\nI just can't understand it.  I mean, I let them practice their religion in peace, why can they not extend the same courtesy to me?\n\nAnswer:",

We have a good relationship and a future together.  I am concerned about his financial situation, supporting an ex wife and family.  His current finances are not good and he is struggling paycheck to paycheck.  I believe this will only be short-term and will improve over time.  We have discussed the situation and have reached a compromise to get us through this time together.  I support myself and contribute significantly to activities and living expenses when we are together.  I am having a problem with his inability to budget and cutback on expenses until his sitaution improves.  He continues to purchase luxury items and unnecessary expenses which are paid for with credit cards.  I have expressed my concern and be told that it is none of my business.  We keep fighting over this matter and it is unhealthy for our relationship.\\n\\nAm I being controling and interfering? I'm just looking for any comments and advice on how I should handle this.\nAnswer: certainly defer marriage until he gets his finances in order.  You don't want/need his credit card debt.  He may have to file bankruptcy in the future if he is actually out of control.  No sense fighting over it though, just don't get stuck with his bills.\n\nAnswer:",

Or, is the NTRP ineffective and require overhaul?\\n\\njeffspin@comcast.net\nAnswer: Good question. Unfortunately, there are very mixed motives involved in the current classification system. Those who play in leagues or tournaments usually want the lowest rating they can get so they can win. Those who use the rating to let others know how good they are, usually want to be rated higher.\\nIf you are \"accurately\" rated, you will likely be mismatched against those who fudge. This encourages a downward push such that those who previously might have been 5.0s, for example, are now 4.5s.\\nRatings now appear to be based first on your self-assessment, which is frequently falsified, and secondly on your results. I know that players will lose a few matches on purpose just to avoid being moved up a level. This clearly is not in the best interests of the game or in fair competition.\\nSo, I do not believe the system is effective in accurately classifying players.\n\nAnswer:",

I think the purpose of it is to show the government how many people care about this issue by a figure they can cite and read (i.e. the reduction in power usage) The trouble is that because it's been badly advertised then if nobody does it then the government may see it as an excuse that people DON'T care, when in fact they just haven't heard about it.\n\nAnswer:",

What is Emphysema?\\nFAQ\\n\\nFrom Stacey Lloyd,\\nYour Guide to Lung Diseases.\\n\\nA.\\n\\nEmphysema is a lung disease in which the walls of the alveoli (air sacs) in the lungs fracture or burst. As these alveoli break, the remaining alveoli become enlarged to make up for the loss. This results in a fewer number of alveoli, with many enlarged. \\nWhen alveoli are enlarged, they loose their elasticity. A loss of elasticity in the alveoli results in the inability to eliminate air from the lungs. Therefore, patients must use force (energy) to expel this air. \\n\\nFurthermore, the loss of elasticity in the lungs affects the smaller bronchial tubes. To push air out of the bronchial tubes, a higher pressure must be developed inside the chest. \\n\\nThis higher pressure tends to collapse the smaller bronchial tubes, making it even more difficult to empty air from the alveoli. \\nCoughing becomes very difficult and ineffective in expelling mucus, leaving the lungs more susceptible to lung infections, such as pneumonia. \\n\\n( http://lungdiseases.about.com/od/emphysema/f/emphysema_expl.htm )\\n\\nWhat causes emphysema?\\nEmphysema can be caused by one or a combination of these things:\\n\\nCigarette smoking: Most cases of emphsyema are caused by cigarette smoking. Cigarette smoke reaches deep into the lungs and causes permanent damage. If you have emphysema from cigarettes, the best way to stop your lung damage is to quit smoking as soon as possible. It's never too late to quit smoking. \\nAlpha-1 Antitrypsin deficiency: Some people have emphsyema because of a rare genetic disorder called Alpha-1 Antitrypsin deficiency. People with Alpha-1 are missing an enzyme that protects their lungs. Some people with Alpha-1 deficiency get emphysema without ever having smoked. Other people get emphsyema from the combination of smoking and having Alpha-1 deficiency. \\nAir pollution: There is some evidence that air pollution can contribute to people getting emphysema, especially if the person also smokes.

Has the new system of calling everything taken the fun out of the game?\nQuestion: I still enjoy watching NHL games but it seems to me that the game has been watered down. You know I am a huge Red Wings fan and I reall started watching b ack in the heyday of the Colorado/Detroit rivalry. The passion and all out support of ones teamates seems to be a thing of the past. I will not lie I miss fighting. All season long I have not seen more than two fights. Dammit it is part of the game. If the fans enjoy it and the players still have the willingness and the ability to do it then why does it seem like the NHL leadership has completely tried to eradicate it?\nAnswer: The NHL is thriving and has never been better! Attendance is up! TV ratings are up! Everything is up!\\n\\nYou sound like a dinosaur fan lamenting the \"glory days\" when no-talent thugs ruled the game and bench-clearing brawls were a nightly occurrence. I found that to be abject and embarrassing! All it did was made the NHL look like some bush league where professional wrestling fans and other such losers could go to swill bear, scream obscenities and pick fights in the stands. No thanks!\\n\\n*Update: I'm glad we had our little offsite IM exchange, bugman, as I think we understand each other better now. We might not be on the same page, but we both love the game. And I promise you it is only going to get better! Go Sabres!\n\nAnswer:",

There are also  people who interfere in anothers life because they feel that anyone different from themselves must be made to be more like them. The fact is, people will always be resentful of those who are different, because of fear, which is generated from ignorance. Or because they're just plain jealous.  Just be happy in who you are, because you are the only person you've got to live for.\n\nAnswer:",

Capuano is pretty good, but not as good as the Cy young candidate Santana.  Berkman hit two Bombs today.  You know what you will get from Santana and Berkman --two top tier players.  Bonds is extremely high risk.  Visquel is good but not a great offensive player, and he hits in a pitching friendly BP.  You gotta take this trade!\\n\\nAll in all, you gave 4 for 2--you get to pick up two players, a 2B, and SS.

For a pumpkin, it depends on where you are - some cuisines use pumpkin in the sweet course (like pumpkin pie), while others use it as a savory side dish.\\n\\nBotanically speaking, it is a fruit. However, \"vegetable\" is not a term that is used at all in botany. It doesn't refer to a specific plant structure and all botanical terms specify what part of the plant the items comes from. \\n\\nSo if you are going to insist that a tomato is a fruit, you should also point out that zuchinni and okra are also fruit; spinach is a leaf; rhubarb and celery are stems; carrots, radishes, and turnips are roots; broccoli and cauliflower are both flowers and stems; nuts, grains and legumes are seeds; and potatoes are specialized stems called tubers.\n\nAnswer:",

Do you know of any that have good journalism programs? If you could actually support your answers with reasons, that would be great, although obviously not necessary.\nAnswer: Well, I don't profess to know a lot about universities, but I'd say that Washington State University is a pretty good college for journalism, if not the best.  I guess it depends on where you live and how much you are willing to pay for college.  Edward R. Murrow got his degree at WSU, and they named the School of Communication after him.  On the website it says their school of communication (which includes journalism) is ranked 12th in the nation.  Which isn't the best, but it's pretty good.

I have not taken more than a day off at a time and only due to my car or a sick child.  I had a good relationship with my last manager and felt comfortable asking her anything.  I am a part-time student and have to do 64 directed practice hours for my degree program this spring.  I  have to do it when I am scheduled and it will be my last semester.  It may be in a \"two days here, two days there\" fashion.  This time will be taken as vacation on my part.  I also have the opportunity to go on a week-long cruise in January.  I do/will have the vacation hours/time to do both.  Last month, a new manager came aboard and I feel intimidated to ask for the time to do both situations.  We are on \"production\" and we found out that he is a \"micromanager.\"  Both events may or may not happen in rapid succession.\nAnswer: It sounds like you are due a vacation. Submit your request to your manager in writing. This way your manager does not feel pressured to answer you while you are standing there. In your request, make certain to list the positive things you have done for the company and also indicate that you are due the vacation time\n\nAnswer:",

How do you assess Part-Time Experience? \\nPart-time experience will be included on a pro-rata basis if the applicant can demonstrate that they have been employed for a minimum of 20 hours/week.\\n24. How do you assess Full-Time Experience? \\nFull-time experience is defined as 38 hours or more per week. Please note that we will not scale experience up based on hours per week. \\n\\nMy Experience is 31 month of fulltime and 17 Month of part time the total is 4 yours but i wonder if i can apply? what is pro-rata means in above? is it means my 16 will calculated fulltime???\nAnswer: I assume that you are talking about a Skills Assessment with the Australian Computer Society. If you have a 3-year bachelor degree in Computer Science and have 4 years experience after you completed the course then you may be eligible for a skills assessment. It is not sufficient to just have 4 years experience and it is unlikely that work experience before you graduated will be counted. \\n\\nTo calculate your work experience when you were working part time you need to show that you were working part time at least 20 hours per week - for every year you were working 20 hours per week you can claim 6 months full time work experience.\\n\\nIf you need further information you can email me on answers@visalogic.net\n\nAnswer:",

Examples?\nAnswer: Yes, I believe hamster activity does change with the phases of the moon slightly. For emample, with rodents in the wild under the light of a full moon activity seems increased. Whether it's more light to see by or the moon's gentle tug of gravity on the water in a mammals body I could not say for sure. It could be due to other activities in the night that change during a full moon that cause the hamster's to change their behavior in response to that as oppossed to due to the moon directly. This is just my opinion. Insofar as hamsters as pets inside the home perhaps it is in the genes from their former wild counterparts that would cause increased activity.\n\nAnswer:",

Even einstein proved that when the universe 'came into being' that time and space appeared at the smae time. Therefore God cannot be measuerd by time or space since he is outside of them both. Thus he has no beginning or end and he has no physical size since he is outside our physical ability to measure. Being the creator though, means that he can also enter into the creation when he wants to (as in the form of Jesus). In the same way that an architect is not part of the house that he has designed or built but is still able to enter it.\n\nAnswer:",

What you do is take cards with different color combinations on them and show them to students ranging from kinder-garden to the 12th asking them which color combination is their favorite. The first case is where you do it individually and then as a collective class. You should find that the younger children will stand by their first choices even during a group decision. As the children get older they are more prone to follow the choices of their peers until the later years where individuality take hold once again and they start to diversify. I used pie charts and percentages to display alot of the information and also split up the classes into males and females for a follow up experiment. Its been many many years since I did it but I'm sure the results will fascinate the judges. Good Luck!\n\nAnswer:",

From a woman's point of view I think a beautiful face is God given and therefore, a gift that can not be achieved by just makeup, etc. Now, a great body can be achieved through exercise, diet and dedication. So, if you have the willpower and have a beautiful face you can have both.\n\nAnswer:",

The withdrawl sensations are too overwhelming. Help!?\nQuestion: I've tried in the past to slowly decrease the dose so I can be zoloft free, but my face starts to feel numb and I get sensations of electric shocks in my head.  It's so weird!  I've talked to a few doctors about it and it seems that the drug is so new they basically don't understand it either.  The drug has done wonders for me in the last 6 years. Although I agree the drug is not for everyone, it saved me from a very dark place, and now that I've been in the light for a few years, I am ready to try life without the meds.  Anyone with this problem too?  What did you do?  Also, anyone with questions about the drug, please ask because I find that I am informative with experiences while on it, but not when trying to eliminate it from your life.\nAnswer: I know the sensation you're talking about. I was on Paxil for a while and when I was comming off it I got rushes through my head (felt like electricity), plus I'd get dizziness along with it that felt a little bit like vertigo. I cut my dose down gradually over about a month or so. Have you tried 75mg for a week then 50mg for a week, then 25mg for a week, then one every other day for a week?\n\nAnswer:",

How did all populations of humans advance at the same time?\nQuestion: For approximately 150-200,000 years, humans essentially lived like very smart animals, then fairly suddenly, about 10,000 years ago, we all seemed to have discovered agriculture and \"civilization\"..a few thousand years later we were all writing.  I have never seen a decent, logical explanation for how all the populations of the Earth took this \"great leap forward\" at the same time-After 150-200,000 years, suddenly within about 1% of that time frame, there are cities everywhere from the Middle East, to China, to North and South America?  Writing starting independently everywhere?  For me, this is the most mysterious event in all of history-any ideas?\nAnswer: Hey! Your \"other\" question is already cluttered up with some high voltage discussion and nice arguements so, I thought I should post my answer here as it is more peaceful and calm here. I was wondering whether I should have posted my answer there? \\n\\nNow, I'll try to make sense while talking about a topic that I know little about. \\n\\n1- It all started with the arrival of the first bipedal- Australopithecus anamensis. (some might argue that it was Ardipithecus ramidus). Ok, the point is, as our ancestors started to learn to walk on two feet, they had some challenges to face as bipedalism reduced their speed considerably putting them at a clear disadvantage against their predators.\\nNow, as this problem was faced by all the hominids all over the world at the same time, it led to some parallel thoughts (and thus inventions and discoveries) all over the world e.g. building homes, making weapons and tools etc. (The stone tools were first made by the handy man i.e. Homo habilis and not Australopithecus).\\nThis tool technology was spread by Homo ergaster as they  migrated outside Africa.\\n\\n2- Then, in the course of evolution, the early humans started to have a complex cultural lives and they grew emotionally, e.g. the Neanderthals (who aren't our direct ancestors) started to bury the dead.\\n\\n3- As the homo species like homo erectus, homo neanderthalis, homo heidelbergenesis and ancient homo sapiens (Cro Magnon) made further advances in creativity and productivity, they all felt a natural need to pen down their thoughts. This led to the cave painitngs and carvings. All of those paintings can be interpreted as diary entries as you may see that the paintings and carvings simply depict what the early men \"did\" i.e. hunting, using tools etc.\\nSo, I guess it is understandable why the \"pictorial-scripts\" developed contemporarily to each other.\\n\\n4- But the question still remains: Why were the origin of world's ancient scripts so contemporary to each other? I guess, as man found the pictorial depiction of thoughts and emotions more and more unconvenient and tedious due to the diverseness of thoughts and situations to be depicted, it started taking help of symbols. Perhaps, this behaviour was so \"human-like\" that every sub-species of the homo sapiens followed this pattern of 'depicting thoughts symbolically' universally.\\n\\n5- Another reason of this might be migration. Before the ancient civilizations like Inka, Mesopotamia, Egyptian etc. even came into existence, the early hominids led a nomadic life. According to the \"Out of Africa Hypothesis\", all the modern humans \"Homo Sapiens\" originated from Africa. Later, they migrated to Africa, Asia and Europe and formed groups.\\nSo, I guess due to their similar ancestral origins, the human beings had a common problem solving approach and hence, attempted the problem of inconvenience of pictorial scripts in a nearly identical manner.\\n\\nThe scientific difference in the scripts can explain that they were devised on completely different grounds but, the approach was similar due to common origins and creative grounds.\n\nAnswer:",

The atoms in your hand swell from the absorbed energy and then once you stop hitting the table, slowly release that energy in an attempt to get back to their normal existing ground state. the transferring or processing of that absorbed energy will feel like itching which is really just a lesser degree of pain.\\n\\n2.Your legs were also releasing stored energy throughout your leg muscles during your run, adding to the absorbed energy from running. \\n\\nThis is also why a sunburn will itch like crazy, absorbed solar energy is finding a way out of your body.\\n\\nAs your body cools down the itching may get worse, because cooling will close your pores, trapping the heat.\\n\\nHope this helps\n\nAnswer:",

My boyfriend lived in Wisconsin and so I was planning on moving to Milwaukee with him and eventually going to school there. We'll both be moving into the city without jobs right away but should have one within a month.\\n\\nI currently have bills that total to about 400 dollars a month.\\n\\nAs far as moving expenses, there will be none other than gas as I will be having family help me move everything.\\n\\nWhat do you think would be an appropriate amount of money to be saved considering the circumstances?\nAnswer: You will need at least first, last months rent and maybe enough for a security deposit. That could be anywhere from 1400 to 2100 dollars. Turning on your utilities usually has a charge as well so save about a 100 for that. I would also suggest saving the 400 that you will need to your already existing bills plus another 200 for food and miscellaneous items. I am assuming that your boyfriend will split the apartment costs with you evenly so you need $1,100 each for the apartment and an additional $600 on your part for your food and outstanding bills. I would aim for about $2000 in case it takes longer to find a job or at least so you can guarantee paying your second month of rent if you had just gotten a job when rent was due.

The particular bacteria might be resistant to whatever antibiotics they gave you.  You would need a culture of your snot to determine this.\\n\\nUltimately though, the problem probably started with poor sinus drainage.  Even with appropriate antibiotics, the problem will recur if the sinus drainage issue isn't resolved.  In the short term, Sudafed would probably help.  I don't like the idea of using Sudafed for more than a couple of weeks though.  If you have allergies exacerbating the situation (do you have a history of seasonal allergies, or any new pets?), then Benadryl or non-sedating Claritin would help.  For really bad cases, I know of a doctor that swears by the Neti pot (he uses it himself).  It's like a little watering pot for plants.  You fill it up with water or saline and pour it into your nose.  Basically you're physically cleaning out your sinus openings.\\n\\nIf there is a possibility you're allergic to something, I would try Claritin and the Neti pot first for 3 days and see if the symptoms improve.  If you don't think it's an allergy, try Sudafed + Neti pot.  If that doesn't do it, I would go back to the doctor and try another antibiotic together with the Sudafed + Neti pot.  VERY IMPORTANT: IF THE INFECTION SPREADS--YOUR CHEEK BECOMES RED AND PAINFUL OR IT HURTS TO MOVE AN EYE--GO STRAIGHT TO THE ER.  Sinusitis is normally just an inconvenience, not a serious health problem.  It can sometimes spread, however, and cause cellulitis in your cheek or an orbital abscess in your eye socket--both very serious conditions.\n\nAnswer:",

If one person doesn't do their assignment, the whole play is shot!\\n\\nThe most important is the O line.  It doesn't matter if you have the best QB in the world, if he doesn't have the time to throw it to the best reciever in the world.  If you have an average RB behind a good line, he will have more yards than a great RB behind a crap line.  An O line that can block for 4 yards every run play then opens up the QB to do his thing and get all the glory.\\n\\nOn defense, it is the D line.  They are the ones who fill the holes up front against the run, taking blocks and jamming the line, allowing the Linebackers to get the tackles.  Most DB interceptions happen because the D line has pressure the QB into a bad throw.\n\nAnswer:",

This does not make it any less real than an allergy diagnosed and treatable with antihistamines. It is very real to those suffering from this unusual but documented ailment.\\n Sometimes this sort of allergic reaction can be treated as a phobia, ie. fear of heights can be conquered by slow but firm exposure to high places, but most likely it stems from a bad experience as a child or infant and until this can be recognized by the sufferer it may continue throughout life.\n\nAnswer:",

Does she have to ask you several times to do something? \\n\\nHave you been up to anything recently that she told you not to do?\\n\\nIf your track record here isn't great, it's time to lay a better foundation -- plan on a few months of being  a model citizen to prove yourself before approaching the topic again.\\n\\nOkay, so if you've got that part - you do your homework, do your cchores promptly without whining, haven't been up to anything that got (or would get) you in trouble, then it's time to lay it out professionally.\\n\\nYou ask to meet with your parents. Before that, you write out:\\n\\n> the reasons why you want to work (\"I'd like to earn money for movies\"  \"It will look good on college applications and resumes late\" whatever your reasons are)\\n\\n> your plan for making sure the job doesn't interfere with school (\"I'd only work during school breaks\"  \"I'll only work one day a week\" whatever your plan is)\\n\\n> anything that argues that you're responsible enough to handle it \\n\\n> what you could gain from working (\"money for clothes\"  \"I'll put half of what I earn into savings for college\" \"experience working with other people\" etc.)\\n\\nThen you meet with them and give them a copy of all of this.\\n\\nUnderstand that they still might say \"no.\"  If so, ask them, calmly, why they're saying \"no.\" Discuss it with them, calmly, but don't throw a tantrum - that will just prove that you're not mature enough.\\n\\nIf they do say \"no,\" ask them to help you figure out another way to earn money.

The very purpose of keeping files hidden is so that noone can access them. If you have WindowsXP in your computer, all you have to do is go to the respective folder where you think the file was hidden, and run a random search for \"All Files and Folders\" in that particular folder/drive only. Don't forget to check \"hidden files\" before running your search option. Once done, your results will definitely give you the requested hidden file even if you forgot its name. If not, it means the file is corrupted by some unknown virus, and there is little you can do to remedy the situation. Be careful next time.\\n\\nIn fact, searching the file is the ONLY method to gain access to hidden files.

He was the first to suggest that we go through psychological stages and he helped us to understand the development between these and how we should properly prepare our children so they do not become fixated with one or more stage. He introduced the Ego, Id and SuperEgo and explained how each has it's own driving force and needs. When Freud explained everything was somehow driven by some sort of sexual desire he brought sex to the minds of everyone. He was one of the first people to look at sexual desire as a normal thing, and not as a taboo. This encourage other psychologist to look into sexual desires, as well, and thats partially why its not so taboo now-a-days. I would further my research on the subject, however, if I were you. It's been over a year since I've learned about psychology theories and I might be a little off.\n\nAnswer:",

They are not necessarily conservative or liberal. They do it willingly, without government mandate. And these people do the lion's share of the work...bless them and help them as much as you can.

He's coming back, there's little doubt about that (its just a matter of where and when). Fantasy games are fickle because people drop and trade based on streaks. Avoid that. He'll be back and he'll be good. The risk of that is worth a bench spot for now, isn't it? If he decides not to play by June or July, then pick up somebody else. But if he decides to play and you traded him for some fourth-starter, you'll kick yourself.\n\nAnswer:",

Almost everytime a black person is eliminated, I get comments about how racist American Idol is, despite the fact that half of the American Idol finalists have been black.  So, is there ever a scenario under which a white American Idol beating a black American Idol finalist would not be considered racist?\nAnswer: People can be racist no matter what \"color\" they are, and to answer your question - yes and no. Racist people are racist no matter what happens. My mom is white, and my dad is black. My mom grew up in Minnesota and Iowa, and my dad was a Navy brat. They meet in Iowa at college, and had 5 kids after they married. After 9 years, they moved to Tampa, and we've been here ever since. At any given time, my parents can both \"act white\" or both \"act black.\" They both love casseroles and collard greens. \\nMy point in all of this is that PEOPLE love American Idol, and PEOPLE dislike American Idol. Even though it's stupid, hypocritical, and racist what the people are blogging, they're gonna keep doing it till they get their mind renewed. I hope that this helps your cause.\n\nAnswer:",

It may have something to do with our angular measurement system.  The Earth rotates 360\u00b0 every 24 hours.  Each hour represents 15\u00b0 of angular rotation.  Each minute of time represents 15 minutes of angular rotation and each second of time represents 15 seconds of angular rotation.  As to where our time measurement system came from, I don't know, but it could probably be found out pretty easily by doing a few searches.\\n\\nCheck this link for books on the subject:\\nhttp://books.google.com/books?q=origin+of+time+measurement&ots=V7_ssegXJ4&sa=X&oi=print&ct=title\n\nAnswer:",

Dogs with curved tails are known to be chasing flies and fleas that got on their tails. Owners of the dogs found this a nuisance that all of a sudden a dog would keep chasing its tail for several hours in a week. Due to this dogs forgot their \"job\" which was to guard sheep, or pull carts, etc.\\nSecondly, certain dogs go very wild if we pull their tails, even if its done playfully. They simply get mad at you, bite you or even kill you, if you are small.  Since little children always found it playful to pull the tails of the dogs and this meant a potential danger to their lives, the owners cut their tails short. \\nEver thought of the word CUR-TAIL? :-)\n\nAnswer:",

Right-click on this String and click Delete and then exit regedit.\\n   6. Go to \"My Computer\" and open \"C:&#92;windows&#92;system32&#92;\"\\n   7. In that folder there is a file called \"pushow*.dll,\" where * is the random number you saw above. Delete all pushow*.dll files.\\n\\nThat's all you need to do to remove the program.

This has the effect of slightly increasing your weight at the poles (since you are close to the centre of the Earth and the gravitational force depends on distance) and slightly decreasing it at the equator.\\n\\nAs far as centrifugal (actually centripital) force goes, it also serves to increase the effects of gravity at the poles.\n\nAnswer:",

Unchilled milk would soon go sour due to acid production by lactobacilli. Even if kept refrigerated, raw milk goes off rapidly due to the action of psychrophilic (cold-tolerant) bacteria. These produce proteinases and lipases which break down both the protein and the fat in milk, causing rancid and bitter tastes and clotting. \\n\\nOne unusual type of bacteria which can grow is called Alcaligenes viscolactis \u2013 this produces sticky threads of exopolysaccharide in the milk called ropiness.\\n\\n:)\\nPeace\n\nAnswer:",

Christ calls us to surrender to Him, through faith alone.  Baptism is only an avenue through which Christians make others aware of the decision they have made to become a Christian.  While Baptism should be strongly encouraged, because of the external witness it provides, it can by no means be considered salvific.  You are saved through faith, not by works, lest anyone should boast in themselves.  (Ephesians 2:8-9).\n\nAnswer:",

Noise is primarily a nuisance effect, but heat is a potentially serious problem because winding insulation will be damaged if allowed to overheat. Heating may be minimized by good design, ensuring that the core does not approach saturation levels, that eddy currents are minimized, and that the windings are not overloaded or operated too close to maximum ampacity. \\n\\nLarge power transformers have their core and windings submerged in an oil bath to transfer heat and muffle noise, and also to displace moisture which would otherwise compromise the integrity of the winding insulation. Heat-dissipating \"radiator\" tubes on the outside of the transformer case provide a convective oil flow path to transfer heat from the transformer's core to ambient air: \\n\\nFollow the link for more information.\\nHope this helps you!\n\nAnswer:",

Kevin Jones (at Falcons) or Mike Bell (at Steelers)?\nQuestion: I'm flip-flopping on this one.  The other Broncos RB (Tatum Bell) might not play much.   The Steelers haven't exactly been dominant against the run this year.   \\n\\nThe Lions could fall behind early to the Falcons potent attack and then abandon the running game.  But Kevin Jones also scores fantasy points by catching the ball, too.  He has 37 receptions this season already. \\n\\nThe most well-reasoned answer wins.\nAnswer: Well, the question is not a hard one. Your facts are confusing you and that is why it is a hard question. No running back this year has gained over 100 yards against the steelers. NOBODY!\\nHere goes the breakdown for you:\\nweek 1: r. brown(mia) 15 rushes for 30 yards. . . long 8\\nweek 2: f. taylor(jax)   22  for 92. . . .long 25\\nweek 3: r. johnson(cincy)   19 for 47. . . . long 8\\nweek 4: LT(SD)   13 for 36. . . .long 12\\nweek 5: LJ(KC)   15 for 26. . . .long 8\\nweek 6: w. dunn(atl) 26 for 69. . . .long 9\\n              m. vick(atl) 5 for 40. . . .long 14\\nweek 7: j.fargas(oak) 18 for 55. . . .long 9\\n             l. jordan(oak) 7 for 21. . . .long 7\\nthe total for all of this. . . . .  46.2 yard avarage. GO FIGURE!!!\\nand these are your main backs for there respective teams, too.\\n\\nSooooo. . .like i was saying, it is not the question that has you confused, it is your facts. Here go the facts for you and you should not have a problem now making a decision. I have Tatum in my league and he is on the bench. I also have rudy johnson from cincy and he was on the bench. And here goes one more stat for you, Atlanta gives up 94.9 yards per game. \\n\\nSooooo. . . .who do you think you should start? How can you run against a defense designed for the run only? The different blitz schemes they run, and how well they cover the field. The Broncos wideouts are not that good so one on one coverage with the strong safety back will be all they need. they will bring 7 sometimes 8 in the box. The Steelers have giving up only 4 rushing touchdowns all season. 2 to Brown in week 1 but since then. . . one to Larry Johnson(wk5) and the other was Warrick Dunn(wk6). \\n\\nJust be smart. . . .Go to nfl.com and find out for yourself if you dont believe me, then you can come back and vote this answer as the best.\n\nAnswer:",

He may give you an oral med to take.  Or if you prefer over-the-counter treatments like vaginal suppositories/creams, you can clear it up in a few days. There are a couple of different kinds; if one ingredient doesn't work, try a different one.  Also over-the-counter cortisone cream will relieve the itch. Stay clear of sweets, white \"carbs\" like bread and pasta, eat yogurt with acidophalus cultures included (kills yeast) or take the over-the-counter acidophalus capsules.  Wear natural-fiber, loose fitting clothing and cotton panties/bras.  You want to keep the areas as dry as possible.  You can apply cornstarch to soothe and dry the areas also.  Don't use harsh soaps; try a bath in tipid water with 1/2 cup of oatmeal in a wash cloth tied with a rubberband.  It's a great gentle cleanser and won't irritate your delicate skin.  If you have an intimate partner, they will want to be treated also as you can pass this back and forth.  Hope this helps cause I know you must be miserable.  God bless.\n\nAnswer:",

I would like to know the volume of cubic yardage purchase in 2004-5; and the price paid @ cu yd.  I also want to know if these agencies purchase thru a bidding system and if so; how to receive bidding information.  I am curious to know if this material is purchased on the basis of dellivered to them; or if they hire trucking companies to get it from the vendor site where the sand is located?  How much do they purchase at any given time ?  enough for the coming snow season or years in advance? What are the names of specific people and their addresses that do the actual purchasing of sand/sald mixtures for roadway application? Are there any requirements to be met in order to sell this type of mixture to the local governments that purchase it? What other uses does gov't need to purchase sand if any? What licenses are required if any?\nAnswer: Your best place to start would be with the state transportation agency.\n\nAnswer:",

Are some methods more efficient or faster in producing visible results than others?\nAnswer: The more expensive the product, the better it is going to be.  So, starting with the cheapest, is brushing twice a day and flossing.  The cleaner your teeth are, the whiter they are going to be.  Stay away from coffee, tea, and red wine.  Then there's whitening toothpastes, floss, and rinses.  These will give results, but not as much as whitening stips or gels.  I know a lot of people who have been satisfied with Crest Whitening Strips.  Just be careful using whitening products, because they can cause sensitivity.  So, if you already have sensitive teeth, be aware.  Many electric toothbrushes claim to make teeth whiter.  I use the Sonicare brush, and I can tell a difference.  But it's not a dramatic difference.  I notice it, but I don't know if others do.  I know the Crest Spin Brush has one with brusheads that claim to whiten teeth.  If you're looking for a real big difference in shades, then you may want to try the strips.  It seems to be the biggest improvement for the cheapest.\n\nAnswer:",

(guys point of view asked)?\nQuestion: Why can't guys just come out and say how they feel? You're bother thinking it. It's more than obviously shown..... but they still won't say it!\\n\\nWhy? End the torture please!\nAnswer: Well, I think there is some truth to the stereotype that guys have issues with their feelings.   Many of us certainly don't have the emotional vocabulary to describe our feelings like the ladies do.\\n\\nAnother reason is sometimes it's not \"safe\" to express how we feel.\\n\\nFor example, if we feel rejected because we are not getting enough sex from our wives, we are called sex crazed by those same wives.  Why would anyone continue to share their feelings if those feelings are invalidated.\\n\\nMen don't have the corner on this market, women invalidate their man's feelings with similar frequency.\\n\\nI agree, there are ladies who refuse to share their feelings.  They may sulk, pout, or put the walls up, but when you ask them what is wrong, what is the first word past the lips, \"Nothing.\"\n\nAnswer:",

Can't stop. Any recommendations?\nAnswer: It is an old wives tale that cracking your knuckles will cause arthritus, not so. What makes the cracking sound is the space inbetween the joints and when they are manipulated for the crack, they will produce the poping sound. But as for doing your back or neck, those are some pretty important things to your body and if you make a mistake and do it wrong, you could end up with damage from minor stuff to something major enough to need surgery or even cause you to end up in a wheel chair.

I kno it says not to but why?\nQuestion: AHHHRRRGH!!!! I don't know HOW these fleas got in my house but here they are.. and they have dined well. My calves have 20 to 30 bites on them. Im in agony. Calamine is the only thing that helped; benedryl cream didn't do the trick; hopefully the benedryl capsules I took will help. For now I have covered my lower legs in calamine lotion and hydrocortisone cream. Now it only itches something horrible rather than freaking unbearable. So what's the reasoning behind not putting calamine over larger areas like the bottle says not to? Can it honestly really be any worse than the agony of this allergic reaction? It's bugging me! \\nOk, maybe that wasn't funny; but does anyone know?\nAnswer: I don't think it would be a problem to cover larger areas, other than dry skin.  Be sure to wash it all off and reapply once in a while to give your skin a \"break\".\n\nAnswer:",

Your dentist is correct. Cost somewhere between $200-300 per side.  Believe me it is worth it. A hard denture riding on those bones would be worse then a bur under the saddle of a horse. You should heal in about a week and the dentures will fit better.  But remember a lower denture will never fit very well.  The tongue, lips and floor of the mouth will make that baby jump around the rest of your life.  I personal recommend that you see about having implants placed to help stabilize or anchor that thing in.  Never get mad at a dentist for a poor fitting denture. It will never be as good as real teeth.\n\nAnswer:",

If it is good, with scores of at least 680, then consider going to a local credit union.

The expression was documented as being in wide usage in the 1920s, but may have originated much earlier.\\n\\n\"Shucking and jiving\" was a tactic of both survival and resistance.  A slave, for instance, could say eagerly, \"Oh, yes, Master,\" and have no real intention to obey.  Or an African-American man could pretend to be working hard at a task he was ordered to do, but might put up this pretense only when under observation.  Both would be instances of \"doin' the old shuck 'n jive.\"\\n\\nToday, the expression has expanded somewhat from earlier usage, and is now sometimes used to mean \"talking pure baloney,\" \"goofing off,\" or \"goofing around.\"  The original meaning of deceit often remains, however.\n\nAnswer:",

A review of this phenomena has been done.  A quote to give you an idea:\\n\\n\"All investigations in the literature have been subjective, the urine being smelled by individuals (sometimes a panel of individuals) who had been previously shown to be able to positively smell and identify asparagus-related odorous urines. However, with subjective assessment, apprehension always exists concerning the results. \"\\n\\nSo, they can't even decide on who smells what.  Anyhow, the paper is easy to follow, so go have fun, it covers beetroot as well.  As to why it \"makes\" it through your system so fast, the odor producing chemicals are quite soluble, and serum levels of highly soluble ingested chemicals can be detected in a few minutes.  Try taking a liquid B vitamin supplement a few minutes before you need to relieve yourself.  It gets glowing yellow quite rapidly.  Hope this answers your question.\n\nAnswer:",

In return Zeus gave Amalthea the goat's horn. It had the power to give to the person in possession of it whatever he or she wished for. This gave rise to the legend of the cornucopia. The original depictions were of the goat's horn filled with fruits and flowers: deities, especially Fortuna, would be depicted with the horn of plenty.\\nIn modern depiction, the cornucopia is a hollow, horn-shaped wicker basket typically filled with various kinds of festive fruit and vegetables. The cornucopia has come to be associated with Thanksgiving.\n\nAnswer:",

It's not my primary residence.\\nIt's a $300,000 dollar property with $60,000 left on the mortgage. What would you do?\nAnswer: The mortgage is not relevant for taxes.  You need to know your tax basis in the property.  Normally, property received by inheritance is valued at the time of death to determine basis.  This means you should not have a capital gain.  You said the house is \"in trust\".  If this is true, neither you or your brother own the house, the trust does.  Your ability to \"cash out\" is determined by the terms of the trust and the decision of the trustee.  You need to consult and attorney who needs to read the trust documents.\n\nAnswer:",

What can the Michigan defense do to stop or contain Troy Smith? Maybe, take a page from the New England Patriots from a few years ago. They used a 3-4 defense that constantly rotated it's coverage package. Could this work against OSU?\nAnswer: Wow-ask a question like this and you really pull out all the over confident OSU fans.  As my husband likes to say-You can't ever look past any game or team in the big ten.  With classic rivalries such as OSU/Michigan, you can look at stats and rankings but it truly means nothing when these two teams play.  While OSU has had a great offense this year, their offense was crushed last weekend when Illinois found the holes in their line.  And that was a team that doesn't have the #2, questionably the best defense in the country.  If the wolverines can contain Troy Smith and Ted Ginn's run game, which I think they can, Michigan will win.  Neither team will play next weekend like they did last weekend and it always proves to be a great game.\n\nAnswer:",

These systems are safer since they use a lower speed.\\n\\n2)  For more speed, such as to shoot a tennisball across a tennis court, a common method is to use rotating wheels.  As seen from above, position one treaded wheel so that it rotates clockwise on a vertical axis.  Position another treaded wheel so that it rotates counter-clockwise on another vertical axis.  The wheel edges should be spaced just less than a tennisball's width away from each other.\\nDesign a safe delivery system to channel the ball between the rotating wheels, and it will shoot out.  The faster the wheels are spinning, the faster the ball shoots out. (This method can also be done with only one wheel, using a solid launch ramp in place of the second wheel.)\n\nAnswer:",

All of these three changes were brought on by the change from feudalism to capitalism.\nAnswer: Yes \"The French Revolution brought many changes among all four social classes\" is an excellent thesis.

She and I have known each other since high school.  When I left my husband, hers left her around the same time.  For finacial reasons, and moral support, we moved in together with our daughters, who are about a year apart in age.\\n\\nRecently, my friend's ex has decided (for custody issues) that she and I are a couple.  While I have many gay friends and have very short hair, I am in no way a lesbian.  He is planning on citing me in the custody case as a reason that his daughter should not be with her mother (There are many other issues, but this is the one that pertains to me specifically).\\n\\nMy question is: Can I take him to court for slandering my name?  and if not, how can I get this guy to stop?  My daughter and my roommate's daughter both hear this crap come from his mouth every weekend when he brings them back from their separate father-daughter weekends. And I'm sick of it.\\n\\nAny suggestions?\nAnswer: There is one barrier that makes slander cases difficult. A 'well-known' attorney explained this to me a few years ago... you have to prove malicious intent.\\n\\nAs was explained to me, someone making false, negative statements about you isn't enough for a slander case. First there has to be harm done - there was in this case, there has to be some sort of loss - this could be as simple as loss of reputation and last, the offender must have been purposely trying to harm you (malicious intent).\\n\\nMalicious intent is supposedly the hardest part to prove.\\n\\nI would say that in your case, you would have a rather easy time proving malicious intent because the offender has a clear motivate to attempt to smear your reputation.\\n\\nBtw, most attorneys require a large 'down payment' for slander cases... anywhere from 5 to 10k.\n\nAnswer:",

Use ice breakers just to start talking to people, like when waiting for a meeting to start and there are only a few of you there say something. If you are in a situation where no one knows each other than the best thing to do is to be the first to break the ice - people will think that you are very confident and will then try to rally around you since you took the lead in the conversation.\\nSay hi to someone that you regularly see around - that way the next time you see them you can just start talking instead of having an awkward moment. \\nIf you do know a few people but not that well, then the next time you talk to them and they say something like, \"Oh I have to go now I have a really big test\" (or something of the sort) remember it and ask them about it the next time you see them - it looks you care, pay attention and listen.\\nHope this helps.\n\nAnswer:",

If not actually known at this time, is the actual size of the entire universe considered to be knowable (i.e. that there is some possibility of measuring or estimating its size but the techniques are not currently available).\\n\\nI've read that the universe is thought to be \"saddle shaped\"\\nand expanding at an accelerating rate.  If I correctly understand some research that I've done in Wickipedia, the rate of expansion of the universe is 70 (km/s)/Mps or 70 kilometers per second per megaparsec [i.e. million parsecs].\\n\\nI don't understand parsecs, except that they are a measurement of distance similar to light years.  Also, I don't understand the megaparsec part of the expansion rate. What does it mean for example, to say that the universe is expanding at a rate of 70 kilometers per second per (x number of light years)?\\n\\nOne more thing, I was not able to find a rate of acceleration of expansion. Would the form be increase of distance of expansion/s/s?\nAnswer: \"...What are the dimensions (length, width, and height or thickness) of the physical universe (in light years)?...\"\\nThe universe can't be measured in terms of length, width, and height. Such parameters require some reference point from which measurements can be made, along with some distant boundary where the measurement would end. You simply can't do that with the universe because the universe is isotropic, meaning it's the same in all directions from any observing point. From Earth we can look outward in any direction and 'see' about 13.7-billion light years. From Earth that represents a boundary. Here comes the tricky part: if some alien in a galaxy 13.7-billion light years away from Earth looked outward in all directions (including back towards Earth) they'd 'see' a universe that appeared to be 13.7-billion light years in scope. In other words, the universe has no boundary. To have one it would have to be inside some \"thing\" else, and there's absolutely no evidence that such is the case.\\n\\nTo confuse the issue even more, if we had the ultimate telescope with limitless viewing power we still will never be able to see into the universe beyond a certain range. That's because at almost the same instant of the Big Bang the universe briefly expanded faster than light (this doesn't violate relativity because it was the space of the universe that did the expanding). In our 'normal' universe the speed of light is the speed limit which prevents us from ever seeing any of that inflation because it's moving away faster than the speed of light.\\n-----------------------------------------------------------\\n\"...I've read that the universe is thought to be \"saddle shaped...\"\\nMore recent observations point more towards the universe being geometrically \"flat.\" This simply means that the universe appears to be infinite, that its space will expand forever while cooling more and more over the eons.\\n------------------------------------------------------------\\n\"...What does it mean for example, to say that the universe is expanding at a rate of 70 kilometers per second per (x number of light years)?...\"\\nYou've described the so-called Hubble Constant. (70 km/sec/Mpc) It means if galaxy 'A' is 1 Mpc (1-million ly) away from us it's recessional velocity will be 70 km/sec. If galaxy 'B' is 2 Mpc away then it's velocity will be 140 km/sec It's important to keep in mind though that it's space that's expanding like that, not the galaxies moving THROUGH space; they just get carried along.\\n------------------------------------------------------------\\n\"...I was not able to find a rate of acceleration of expansion...\"\\nI've been looking for a figure too. So far the only thing I've come up with is -3.15^36 /sec/sec  Darned if I know what the units of measurement are though. Maybe someone else on Yahoo can help us out with that.\n\nAnswer:",

Should I get a blood test to see if I can omit it as evidence supporting I don't do any illegal substances... any advice stories or information would be helpful...This is in New jersey. Thanx\nAnswer: The charge of Possession doesn't mean or imply ownership or actual personal usage.  If it is in an area under your control (your car or a car you are driving) then it is considered in your possession.  Unfortunately you can't prove you didn't know it was there.  Except maybe if it was a rental car and you just put the keys in it but hadn't put any personal items in it, hadn't started it and had witnesses that said you didn't place anything in the car.\\n\\nSorry I know it isn't the answer you want.\n\nAnswer:",

He drove three hours to spend the holiday weekend with me so I wanted to impress him with a home cooked meal.  I waited until leaving work Wednesday night to go the the grocery store and in the mad push of people, I reached in the bin and grabbed a turkey.  The next afternoon, I placed my turkey in a sink full of water to thaw and began on my side dishes.  After he arrived and we had a drink, he ventured into the kitchen at which point I noticed he was peering down into the sink and frowning.  I asked if something was wrong with the turkey and he said \"Yeah . . . it's a duck.\"  \\n\\nTo my horror, I had picked up a duck and never noticed that this long narrow bird was not a fat round turkey.  I attempted to roast it and while it had a nice flavor, we quickly realized there isn't much meat on a duck.  In addition, my gravy was burnt, my potatoes were salty and the macaroni and cheese was a solid block.  I finally accepted defeat and we ventured out to the local 7-Eleven and had a Thanksgiving hot dog!   \\n\\nI wouldn't have done a thing to prevent it!!  That night my husband told me he loved me for the first time and we have been together for over twelve years.  He turned out to be an incredible cook and  I have never cooked another Thanksgiving dinner!  And every year we toast our famous Thanksgiving duck!\n\nAnswer:",

I cant sell a thing..I dont have any feedback. people dont wanna buy from me because of my score. what should i do?\nAnswer: There are two ways to go about it:\\n\\n1. Buy from other sellers. What I did when I started was to look for any $0.99 items or cheaper, bid on it to get my score up.\\n\\n2. Review the way you sell your items. Many members realize that everyone starts from 0. In my other eBay account, I did not do #1 and instead proceeded to sell with 0 feedback. Buyers bought from me, no problem with 0 feedback. \\n\\nCheck if your item actually fits well with ebay - one of the realities of ebay is NOT all items can be sold on ebay. Do a search for completed items to see if people are buying your type of products, and for what price.\\n\\nAlso check your actual listing. Check the photos, check the titles of your listings to make sure the keywords are there, check the description, check your shipping and handling policies, check your payment policies. And if everything else fails, try to lower your price to get some bidding nibble.\\n\\neBay has several ways for you to determine exactly what the hot items to sell on their marketplace: \\n\\nItems In Demand = the most popular items currently within that particular category. To see the In Demand page, go to http://pages.ebay.com/sellercentral/sellbycategory.html  \\n\\nHot Items by Category Report = a monthly report that lists the fastest growing categories on eBay for the previous month. Go to http://pages.ebay.com/sellercentral/whatshot.html and select \"Hot Items by Category\" from the menu on the left. \\n\\neBay Pulse = \"a daily snapshot of current trends, hot picks, and cool stuff on eBay\". Go to http://pulse.ebay.com/ to see eBay Pulse in action. \\n\\nMerchandising Calendar = eBay promotes specific categories on its home page each month. Savvy eBayers know that this home page exposure results in more interest in such categories. Go to http://pages.ebay.com/sellercentral/calendar.html  to view the current Merchandising Calendar.\\n\\nI suggest she reads the articles on this page Success in Online Auctions http://www.powerhomebiz.com/internet/auction.htm and read the following books:\\n\\nSell it on eBay: TechTV's Guide to Creating Successful eBay Auctions  \\n  Starting an eBay Business for Dummies  \\n  Branding: Brand Strategy, Design and Implementation of Corporate and Product Identity  \\n  How to Sell Anything on eBay . . . and Make a Fortune!  \\n  Ebay Business the Smart Way: Maximize Your Profits on the Web's #1 Auction Site  \\n  The Official eBay Bible\n\nAnswer:",

And he would be riding it up and down the roads alot so i think it needs to be an offroad bike.\nAnswer: The best dirtbike is the safest one.  That usually means a snickers-powered one.  These are also known by the more common name of mountain bikes.  The best ones are made by Cannondale and Trek, and start at about $400.  They require relatively inexpensive tune-ups every so often, and new brake and shifter cables about once a year.  This will get him off his tuches and out in the wilderness.  Remember that a $100 helmet will protect him more than a $100 pair of shoes!\n\nAnswer:",

Which Love is Stronger?\nQuestion: I have been with a guy Zack for a year and a half. He has a 2 year old son who I love like he's my own. But Zack doesnt make me happy anymore. I love him, but the flame isnt there anymore I dont think. I met this kid Mike, I have never wanted to be with anyone more in my life. He is everything I have ever wanted. This should be easy, I feel like the answer is obvisouly Mike... but then why is it so hard to let go of Zack? And which love is the one I stick with... Or should I just run away?\nAnswer: It sounds like right now you shouldn't choose either.  You need to take some time to yourself and figure out what you really want. Otherwise you're going to end up getting hurt or hurting them in the process.\n\nAnswer:",

Malmsteen in March of 1988. Joe Lynn Turner sings on most of the songs, with the three instrumentals being \"Bite the Bullet\" - a brief intro to \"Riot In the Dungeons\", \"Memories\" - the outro to the whole album, and \"Krakatau\" - a six+ minute piece that contains many themes Yngwie still plays in concert today. The songs are strongly influenced by 1970s prog rock and heavy metal, such as Deep Purple's Machine Head or Emerson Lake and Palmer's Tarkus. .\n\nAnswer:",

And why do they hate Americans so much?\nAnswer: Before 1953, Iran was a secular democracy and radical islam was a minor phenomenon.  In 1953, the US helped the Shah overthrow and destroy the Iranian democracy, creating a brutal dictatorship that benefited the US at the expense of the Iranian people.  \\n\\nThis anti-democratic act by the US polarized Iranians.  Since attempts at peaceful democratic opposition were brutally repressed, violent and radical islamic theology became the only force strong enough to oppose it, much the same way countries turned to communism wherever the US supported fascist regimes (Batista in Cuba, Somoza in Nicaragua and Pinochet in Chile, etc.).\\n\\nIn the end, US support for the Shah ended up funding terrorism against the US for 20+ years.  To help the Shah, the US gave him printing presses, plates, paper and ink to produce US $100 bills.  After the fall of the Shah and the capture of the palace, the presses were used to print money both to pay for their anti-US campaigns as well as to destablize the US economy.\\n\\nUS support for brutal regimes is nothing new.  The US philosophy of international relations was and still remains \"My enemy's enemy is my friend\".  Because of this, the US has gotten into bed with some very reprehensible \"leaders\", all in the name of \"US interests\".  For nearly 20 years, the US supported Saddam and sold him WMDs.  The US funded and helped train the Mujahadeen who later became the Taliban.  The US supports Israel unquestioningly, regardless of its actions (and that includes blaming the captain of the USS Cole for Israeli jet fighters firing on the vessel and killing US soldiers).\n\nAnswer:",

I haven't worked in a year due to the cost of childcare...I have 3 children. I applied for the job because I knew that I could do it and it was close to home. I would have been making $2 less an hour than I made at my last job. The interview was perfect but they called this afternoon and said they would keep my resume, they were impressed with me, and that they offered the job to someone else. My feeling is they were obviously not that impressed. Is it normal to feel this depressed about not getting it?\nAnswer: Gee, sounds like my job searching life history.  I, however, do not have children.  But I was laid off in 2004 from my job as a Probation Officer.  (who would have thought they needed less P.O.s) I have been trying to get hired by the State of Georgia and Alabama as a Probation Officer ever since.  I have interviewed for at least 10 different positions, and so far it has been the same response.  \"We were very impressed with you, however, we chose another candidate.  Please continue to apply.\"  If they were so impressed, then why am I still working for peanuts at my current 'fill-in' job that pays $9,000 less per year than I was making?  Who knows.  One office has a female Chief, she refuses to hire women.  She hired a man that was a car washer and a tax preparer, over me, a qualified (both by College degree and 3.5 years experience) probation officer.  I have been so sick of the whole interview scene and depressed to boot.  But, I haven't given up.  I keep praying, and I know that God will lead me where I need to be.\\n\\nMy advise. Keep your head up and stay motivated and positive.  Eventually, an employer will see what a benefit you would be to his/her company, and you will get the job you deserve.\\n\\nGood luck!!\n\nAnswer:",

Afterall you are paying them to deal with him for the day nto simply when he is behacing...it snto like hes biting chidlren.  he just doesnt wanna sleep.  Find a new care provider if necessary!  Most of them deal with kids who wont nap instead of calling mom to pick them up.  (They should credit you for the days you had to get your child too.)\n\nAnswer:",

COULD YOU EXPLAIN THIS PROCESS FULLY?\nAnswer: The warm front is moving into colder air. The moisture at the leading edge of the front freezes when it hits the cold air causing snow. As the front moves through, the warm air is increasingly higher in altitude which causes the falling moisture to warm up in the form of sleet then freezing rain then rain.\\n\\nHope this helps!\n\nAnswer:",

I would use a bunch of cotton, but also find a way to suspend your egg in a number of rubber bands. They need to be tight enough so they don't stretch too far, but loose enough so they move on impact. In combination, the cotton and the rubber bands should protect your egg.\n\nAnswer:",

When I asked for a copy of the appraisal, our realtor indicated that the appraiser normally stopped just above the requested loan amount, even if the home would appraise higher.  Why is this?  If we want an actual appraisal, do we have to purchase that separately?  We're paying for the appraisal ourselves & would really like to know the true appraised value of the home we're buying.\nAnswer: Because normally the appraiser feels it is his job only to justify the price that the house is selling for.  Remember the appraiser is ultimately there to protect the bank that is loaning you the money for the home.  If you default they want to know that they will be able to recoup their costs.\\n\\nIf the appraiser said that the house was worth 50,000 more than you are paying for it are you going to now pay the seller 50,000 more?  If the appraiser says it is worth less than you are paying for it, then the bank is going to make you pay cash for the difference, the bank won't give you a mortgage for more than the appraisal.\\n\\nThere is no incentive for the appraiser to come in with a high appraisal.  They only need to appraise it for the amount that the current transaction is.\\n\\nThe buyer and seller have agreed on a price, the appraisal is there to give peace of mind that the house is worth at least that much.\n\nAnswer:",

Why is the mountain guarded?\nQuestion: I mean, there are people all over the world who have climbed Mt. Everest, but Mt. Ararat is unattainable?? Are there religious fanatics and crooks who don't want us to find out the truth, that nothing of the sort (noahs ark) exists?\nAnswer: Well, I think it's more politics that keep people from climbing Mt. Ararat, as it is in a politically volatile region. I'm sure the local gov't. doesn't want a bunch of religious loonies clambering around in their mountains, leaving trash everywhere and trying to find some non-existent boat. Of course, that doesn't stop Christians from believing any old thing they read about it.\\n\\nPlease, people, for once, think about the logistics of it. A boat that huge, made entirely of wood, COULD NOT survive an ocean voyage--it would collapse under its own weight, to say nothing of tons of cargo!  You cannot fit thousands upon thousands of animals onto a ship that size. There was almost no ventilation, except for tiny windows up at the top. Hello, FUMES, ANYONE?? Could 8 people keep up with the crap from thousands of animals? Where was it disposed of? Where did they keep food for that many animals? \\n\\nWhat about plant life? No, most seeds do not survive brackish water.  What about the fish? With few exceptions, they are adapted to either fresh or salt water, not both. \\n\\nWhat about animals that are so highly adapted to a specific environment that they die if taken out of it? Everglade kites feed exclusively on a specific type of snail, for which their beaks are adapted perfectly. Where did Noah get both the kites AND the snails?? Koalas and eucalyptus trees? Pandas and bamboo? Hummingbirds and various trumpet-shaped flowers?  Roadrunners and lizards? Egg-eating snakes and the eggs they feed on? Vultures and carrion? And then, how did he get them all back where they belong?  Good grief, this story is so silly that I can't believe anyone in the 21st century still takes it literally.\n\nAnswer:",

Focus on eating 4 to 5 small healthy meals a day consisting of fresh fruit and vegetables, whole grains, unsalted nuts and seeds and if you eat meat select baked, broiled fish, chicken and turkey. Avoid fast food and junk like sodas. Begin by going on a brisk walk with your baby for 4,000 steps daily. Slowly increase your distance each week with a goal to do 8 to 10 thousand steps a day.

As a nation industrializes, it faces the same burden as we have faced.  Their workers will demand more safety for its mines and factories, more benefits and better regulation of free enterprise.  Japan has gone through the same growth pain and so will China.  We went through it the earliest.  Understand that China has limited natural resources within its land.  We have a lot of natural resources.  China must import most of its oil for its industries, that will limit the growth to the ability of the Middle East to supply the oil.\\n\\nAs their economy grow, they will face a problem.

So if you really just need Omega 3s Flax is the best choice.\\nIf you also want Omega 6s then Hemp. \\n\\nBTW: Flax is probably the cheapest. You can buy a small bag that could last you a couple of months for less than $3 at any health food store.  All you have to do is grind it up in a coffee grinder and sprinkle the crushed seeds onto cereal, salads or bake into bread or muffins. \\n\\nI tried hemp oil some time back and didn't care for how it made me feel in the morning.  \\nYou might try both in small amounts one at a time and take note of how you feel afterwards.\\n\\nThe very best is fish oil but you have to make sure it's filtered. The body must convert vegetable sources of Omega 3s to the kind your body can use.\n\nAnswer:",

We used reinforced packing tape.  It has the same properties as duct tape.  It is reinforced, however it uses a paper composite and a wet adhesive.  If you are going to do a lot of these boxes on a regular basis, then use reinforced packing tape.  \\n\\nclear tape is ok.  It will work if you have no other options.\\n\\nMasking tape is not made for shipping.  It is for painting.  Dont use it on boxes unless you want the contents to fall out.  \\n\\nThe answer to your question - from an expert - is that duct tape is better than masking tape to hold together 32 pound boxes.\n\nAnswer:",

We have been closing our gates for the last couple of weeks to keep her vicious dog out so that our grandchildren can play in the yard without fear of getting bitten.   The neighbor will come right behind us everytime we close the gate and open it back up yelling and cussing saying it's her land and we cannot close the gates.  What kind of action can I take against this woman?  I cannot sleepl, eat or have peace of mind for fear of her hurting me or my family.\nAnswer: First you really need to make sure that the gates are on your land and that both your Deed and hers do not contain any type of easement, right of ingress or egress, covenant blah blah that entitles her to do this.  Don't assume anything. You probably have your Deed in your files, and you can look at hers for free at the clerk or recorders office.  Many people are amazed to find that their Deed does have one of the above.  \\n\\nOnce you are certain she does not have this right, you can file a complaint in Municipal Court against her.  Chain and padlock the gate while you wait for your court date.  If she keeps it up after you go to court and win, you can probably have her arrested.  At the very least, the police will have to deal with her because you will have an order or decision.  If she gets herself arrested, and she is truly \"mentally ill\" as you say, there is a chance that she will be remanded for observation.\\n\\n\"We have called the police, 911 and the local dhhr and the humane society and NO ONE will do anything.\"   \\n\\nOf course not. The police don't settle Deed issues, she hasn't done anything crazy enough for dhhr to get involved, and the dog hasn't been ruled vicious.  You are going about this all the wrong way, and all you are doing is frustrating yourself.  You are asking people to do things that are not in their power to do.\\n\\nYou need to first check the Deeds and proceed with a complaint filed in Municipal Court against her if you are truly in the right as per your Deeds. Anything less is just going to generate more frustration on your part.\n\nAnswer:",

Kidney failure is a spectrum of disease - there are acute causes (that may be reversible) and chronic causes (with slow decrease in kidney function).  In the worse case senario with complete lack of function, death would occur in a week. \\n2) Dialysis can act as a bridge - to a kidney transplant if the damage is permanent, or until the body can heal itself and resume normal kidney function if the damage is not permanent.  \\n3) Dialysis also allows a means to take off extra body water.  Urination is the main way the body gets rid of excess water - if the kidneys are not working properly, you may or may not be able to produce any urine.  Extra water causes diffuse swelling in the body tissues, including the lungs (which may cause trouble breathing). \\n\\nThe cons:\\n1) Time.  Dialysis is done three times a week, usually for 3 hours.  For some people this may be done more frequently, especially if the nephrologist is trying to take off fluids.\\n2) Risk of infection.  In order to do dialysis, a very large catheter is needed to allow sufficient blood flow.  If known in advance, a fistula is placed into the arm, and a needle is inserted into it each time (A fistula is surgically created by connecting a large artery in the arm to a large vein - this gives a high flow system).  Otherwise, a catheter is placed into the jugular vein or the femoral vein.   These are prone to become infected - either in the skin around it, or by allowing introduction of bacteria into the blood stream.\\n3).  Medication changes.  Most medications have a known time that they are active in the body.  With renal failure, this is usually slowed down, but still occurs at a constant rate over time.  When dialysis starts, there is no longer a predictable amount of medication in your system.  Physicians have gotten pretty good at working around this, but it still can be an issue.\\n4).  Hypotension (low blood pressure).  With kidney disease, it is very important to keep the blood pressure low - this prevents further damage to the kidney (most people on dialysis have some residual kidney function - just not enough to be sufficient).  However, while dialysis is being done, there are large changes in the amount of blood/fluid in circulation in the body.  This can cause abrupt lowering of blood pressure.   \\n\\nIf the kidney damage is reversible - and the patient could eventually come off of dialysis, the pros definately outweigh the cons.   If the kidney damage is permanent, and the patient is not a candidate for transplant, this has to be a very individualized answer - depending on their values and quality of life, the scale could tip in either direction........\n\nAnswer:",

These are how the current crop of Web superstars are running their businesses such as MySpace, Craigslist, etc. You may be able to get ideas from it and adopt it to what you want to do on the Web.\\n\\nThe Web offers tremendous opportunities for those who know how to harness it. You hear of stories of people who earn thousands if not millions of dollars from doing business on Web. While there are many scams (same way in the traditional business world), there are various ways you can legitimately make money on the Web.\\n\\nHere are the main business models you can adopt:\\n\\n1. Sell products on the Web - Big boys like Amazon or Lillian Vernon online catalog or smaller businesses like BigKidsVideo.com or Candle4Less.com all sell products on the Web. \\n\\nYou can either sell: (a) through your own storefront through your own website or applications such as Yahoo Stores; or (b) sell through online auctions like eBay\\n\\n2. Information Delivery. Others such as About.com or EuropeforVisitors.com create content and monetize their content in a number of ways:\\n\\na. Advertising - From the article \"How to Generate Advertising Revenues for Your Web Site\" http://www.powerhomebiz.com/vol28/adrevenues.htm , there are several ways you can earn money from advertising:\\n\\n1. Join an advertising network. Advertising networks are organizations that aggregate Web sites that offer advertising space, and sell banner ads (and other advertising options) across them. Traffic requirement is often a minimum of 5,000 monthly impressions, although many do not accept sites hosted by free page services. \\n\\nBurst Media http://www.burstmedia.com\\nFastclick (ValueClick). http://www.fastclick.com\\nAdvertising.com. http://www.advertising.com\\nTribal Fusion http://www.tribalfusion.com \\n\\n2. Participate in contextual advertising networks. Contextual advertising are text ads delivered based on the content of the web page using an automated system. \\n\\nGoogle Adsense https://www.google.com/adsense/\\nYahoo! Publishing Network (currently in beta and available to US publishers only) http://publisher.yahoo.com/ \\nIntellixt http://vibrantmedia.com/site/web_01a5.htm \\nQuigo Adsonar http://www.quigo.com/adsonarexchange.htm \\nIndustryBrains http://www.industrybrains.com \\nCommission Junction Evolution http://www.cj.com\\n\\n3. Sell advertising for your site directly. This is admittedly a more difficult route for a small business site wanting to earn advertising revenues. But hey, as they say: \"no pain, no gain!\" \\n\\nb. Affiliate Programs - you sell other people's products that your audience may be interested in; and you get a certain commission after the desired action was done (whether a sale, a lead, subscription to email newsletter, or however this is defined)\\n\\nc. Paid online content. Hoovers.com or WebmasterWorld.com Supporters forum all require paid subscription before accessing the information\\n\\nd. Content licensing and syndication. Some publishers such as the Associated Press get paid every time their content is published elsewhere\n\nAnswer:",

But it belonged to only one continent. Which one? Please be sure that i can not talking about the current Russian Federation in Asia\nAnswer: It's capital was Moscow, as is that of the current Russian Federation.  Moscow is west of the Urals, so is considered to be in Europe.   Russia has always been considered a European founded nation state that expanded into Asia, so I would say both Russia and the former USSR belong to Europe.\n\nAnswer:",

Iam currently on anti depressants and I feel as though I may be bipolar.\nAnswer: Talk to you psychiatrist.  The most notable clinical feature of bipolar disorder is dramatic mood swings.  As compared to an anxiety disorder or depression where your moods will may be impacted by external factors, but will otherwise remain relatively level, in bipolar disorder patients cycle through periods of mania and depression.  But you should really really talk to your psychiatrist - I assure you he or she knows a lot more about it that I do.  Also, antidepressents effect your mood (obviously - that's the whole point), and may be responsible for some or all of you symptoms.  Your doctor may want to try a different anti-depressent or take you off them entirely for a while before deciding on a new diagnosis.\\n\\nPS. Anti-depressants are a standard treatment for anxiety disorders.\n\nAnswer:",

The many posts on this question show that we often assume a Canadian will look somewhat like us and speak English (even though a good portion of Canada speaks French) and therefore, they must have come legally.  Whereas society looks at any Latino and makes the assumption they are here illegally and they are Mexican.  That is called prejudice.  And unfortunately, our great country still struggles with prejudice as this topic shows so well.\\n\\nUnless you are Native American, your family immigrated at some point - this is what makes America quite unique in the world.  Yes, laws should be followed and enforced, however the automatic biased negative reaction towards Hispanics is wrong.\\n\\nThe first step to getting better on this is admitting that racism does indeed exist.\n\nAnswer:",

Well, I interviewed an ambitious teacher she is also a charming wife. Mrs. Lana Neville. It was my pleasure to interview her. She was so supportive to answer the question with satisfaction and she was so honest.\\nThe school and how she thinks of it were some categories of the questions that I asked. Mrs. Neville teaches grade one through grade 10. Wow! Most people barely succeed working with one grade. Personally, I really love the way she teaches and impressed of the skills she show us. So I inquired about the amount of years she taught. The answer was 10 years of computer teaching can you imagine how many classes that means? No wonder she has abilities and boundaries she can cross that hopefully we will at the end of this year.\\nThere was some comedy too! When I questioned Mrs. Lana about what she wishes to do this year she mentioned that she wouldn\u2019t want to go insane doing paper work. More over her believed that it would be much better if there was a private computer lab and lunch room for the boys so they would have to stay on the girl's area. On the other hand Mrs. Lana loves the school campus she thinks it is so colorful. Sincerely I think we should keep the campus clean in order to keep our school in a phenomenal look.\\nUnfortunately, there were some negatives in students. Mrs. Neville mentioned that kids don\u2019t listen to instructions and they ask questions. That really bugs her. In addition she said that she is a little bit tougher to the boys then the girls because she has harder time communicating with them. Let's hope that doesn\u2019t happen again for both Mrs. Lana and the boy\u2019s sake. \\nPredictably Mrs. Lana told me that if she wasn\u2019t a computer teacher she would defiantly be a graphic design teacher. There is something I always wondered about computer class. I wondered weather it matters or not if we had Information technology in the first or last periods. It turned out to be that it doesn\u2019t matter. \\nPeople be ware! If you miss behave in class you\u2019ll have a detention. So just keep it quite and don\u2019t bother her. Mrs. Lana says she tries to be friendly with students but in the same time she likes to be strict in order to have good discipline in the classroom. Well Mrs. Lana ended her amazing way of introducing us to the real Mrs. Neville by telling us that she is looking forward for a astonishing year which hopefully will be so enjoyable for all of us.\\nOf course, I had really interesting time learning about this great educator\u2019s life. Let\u2019s all hope the absolute best for her. Hope that all of our expectation for this achievable year is high. Just don\u2019t worry do your best and cravingly we will all succeed in this right path.\nAnswer: I would rate this essay a B.  There were quite a few grammatical errors and essay rule errors as listed below that I would change to bring up the grade:\\n\\nDo not use contraction.  In order change it's to it is, wouldn't to would not, don't to do not, let's to let us, doesn't to does not, wasn't to was not, doesn't to does not, you'll to you all, don't to do not, let's to let us and don't to do not.\\n\\n1st paragraph - 2nd line - ambitious teacher she (change she to who) - charming wife.

Did the nearsighted Hearts fans not notice he had already tried to take over other debt-ridden clubs?  I for one will enjoy the demise of a club that has always thought itself above its station.  Support means through thick and thin, not just glory hunting as some Jambos have shown.  Will you still be there when you groundshare with Livi?\nAnswer: I for one will not eat your humble pie never LIKED ROMANOV right from the word go. yes I thought it was great last season any fan would. for you to say you cant wait for the demise of Hearts you cant be a true fan of football. AND YES HEARTS FANS DID NOTICE. that's why there was alot off us very worried. and yes some jambos did have there blind folds on when it came to him. but at long last they have woken up. I admit they should have woken up when he sacked George Burley. When was the last time you Heard GOD GAVE ME ROMANOV at any HEARTS game not be for some time now. I have only missed 3 away games due to work have been to all home games never heard it once. HEARTS FANS DO  SUPPORT  though thick and thin glory hunting is the last thing you can call a hearts fan.

As formed in the liver, bile is a thin, watery fluid to which the gallbladder adds a mucous secretion, forming a complex thickened and stringy substance consisting of salts and bile salts, proteins, cholesterol, hormones, and enzymes. The gallbladder returns water containing salts and other materials to the circulation and concentrates the complex further by a tenfold reduction of the bile salts, which the liver synthesizes from cholesterol. Such foods as fats, egg yolk, and foods rich in cholesterol cause concentrated bile, together with secretions from the pancreas, to be discharged into the duodenum to promote digestion, to stimulate peristalsis and absorption, and to carry off excess cholesterol and the disintegration products of overage red blood cells. The hemoglobin of such disintegrating cells degrades rapidly into reddish-yellow bilirubin, predominant in the bile of carnivorous and omnivorous animals, and biliverdin, a green pigment that appears in the bile of herbivores. Under normal conditions, the liver efficiently clears these pigments.\\n\\nCertain conditions create an inability to excrete bile, and this may create serious disabilities, such as jaundice. In obese and immobilized persons, in pregnant women, and in cases of obstruction of flow of bile, gallstones may be formed by precipitation of bilirubin in combination with calcium and cholesterol. Stasis frequently coexists with inflammation and infection of the gallbladder; this may alter the concentration of bile constituents and create debris around which bile and its components may precipitate to form gallstones, which may then block the common bile duct to reduce or stop the flow of bile. Inflammation and infection, together with the consequent regurgitation of bile into the liver, may damage that organ, sometimes causing cirrhosis.\\n\\n\u00a9 1993-2003 Microsoft Corporation.

Does it mean countries having nukes will always try their all means to keep other countries away from it while, on the other hand, countries not having nukes now will always be trying to have it? Is this the name of the game?\nAnswer: We'll have to sit down with the nuclear bombs over a nice hot cup of coffee and explain that the relationship isnt working out.

Even those not raised nor exposed to a church will believe. It's only as one ages and is exposed to outside influences that belief can be compromised. The inate ability exists even in those that profess not to believe. The strongest atheist, and the staunchest agnostic will call out for God to help them in their darkest hour.

Do you think so ? One day India will unseat America , Or will it ??\nAnswer: For India to become a prime power in the world, it is going to have to do a superb job on ending local corruption.  A little thing Gandhi forgot about.\\n\\nI don't see that happening for at least 50 years.  Because India has 300 million people who speak English, and has a democratic tradition for 60 years, it will surpass China if the Chinese devolve into quarrelling and trying to maintain an economy based on \"the Party.\"  But surpassing China, though a key benchmark, is not the same as unseating American power.\\n\\nBut for your dream to come true, local corruption has to shrink to the point where the smartest young people stay in the country with their PhDs instead of immigrating.\n\nAnswer:",

From the light that we can see, ie.. blue, green, red, yellow...etc, the the higher frequency colors are absorbed more by the atmosphere than the lower frequency(actually they're scattered, they still make it to us but indirectly whereas the yellowish color of the sun is more direct).  So blue, green, and violet(violet having the shortest wavelength) are absorbed by the atmosphere, while red, yellow and orange are allowed through.   The color of blue that we perceive the sky varies from day to day based on the content of gases present and the frequency that they vibrate.  It works the same way as light passing through a blue balloon, except in this case the balloon is our atmosphere.\n\nAnswer:",

I didn't eat for the whole day except for soup, and everything was going well. I just ate a bunch of chips, a Lean Pocket, a sandwich, 4 strawberries, Chewy bar, a Hershey's kiss, and a piece of chocolate. I feel so sick! Can someone make me feel better?\nAnswer: The problem is when you try to starve your body you get really hungry and in the end over eat. Instead you should have 5 small meals a day. For the average women trying to lose weight they should stick to a 1600 calorie diet. .\\n\\nLosing weight first starts with being happy with yourself and loving *YOU* on the inside. Try everyday to smile and laugh, LAUGHING is super helpful. It seems weird but it really does help! =) Try to follow a 1600 calorie diet. \\nIt's best to have 5 meals a day that way you don't get to hungry because that leads to over eating. \\nHere is a couple ideas to help you get started:\\n\\nBreakfast: \\nOatmeal and a piece of wheat toast w/ 2tsp. trans free margarine. -OR- Strawberry Banana Smoothie (In a blender process until smooth, 1 small banana, 1/2 cup strawberries, 1/2 cup fat free milk, 1/2 cup low fat plain yogurt, 2 tsp. honey, and 1 or 2 ice3 cubes. You can have your smoothie with 1 or 2 pieces of whole wheat toast. -OR- An egg on a piece of wheat toast with salsa (make 2 servings) ---If you are still huingry at breakfast have a small piece of fruit. \\n\\nLunch:\\n1 cup soup (water based not cream base) and a Cheese and Tomato Sandwich: 2 slices whole wheat bread, 2 slices reduced fat cheese, mustard and sliced tomato. -OR_ instead of the tomato sandwich 2 pieces whole wheat with 2 slices of Turkey and Mustard. -OR- A Lean Cuisine Frozen Meal (These are actually very tasty. The meat is delicious. \\n\\nDinner: 1 piece Chicken Breast with 2 side dishes: 1 cup steamed veggies, 1 sweet potato, 3/4 cup corn, 3/4 cup butternut squash, etc.\\n\\nDessert:\\nLight Ice Cream or Frozen Yogurt:\\n3/4 cup with no more than 110 calories per 1/2 cup topped with tablespoon chocalate syrup. \\n\\nSnacks:\\nSteamed Veggies, fruit, any nuts (these are great protein), \\nmy personal favorite snack is Light and Fit 60 calorie yogurt cup with a 100 calorie Granola Bar. (I cruch up the Granola Bar and put it inside of my yogurt.)\\nAlso there are alot of great ideas if you go to fast food for example.... \\n\\n\\nWendys: Ultimate Chicken Grill Sandwich- 390 calories\\n\\nMcDonalds:\\nCaesar Salad grilled Chicken-220 calories\\nBacon Ranch Salad w/grilled chicken 260 calories\\nSalad Dressing: Vinaigrette: 40 calories\\nSalad Dressing: Italian : 60 calories\\nFruit and yogurt Parfait: 160 calories\\nChicken McNuggets: (4) 170 cal.

They're delicious just No MAyo. My favorite is Sweet Onion Chicken Teriyaki. I like to get a foot long and have a 6' for lunch and a 6' for dinner.\\n\\nAlso make sure you do 30 minutes of excercise 5 days a week. I like to walk to the store and back instead of drive =)\\n\\nThis was just some ideas to help you on your way. \\n\\nAlso its great to drink one glass of water before eating. Water is very important! It takes your body 30 minutes to tell your brain you're full so sometimes after you eat a small meal wait 30 minutes to see if you are still hungry or not.\\n\\n\\nGOOD LUCK!!!

But whenever I look at his pictures or video of him, I just say: \"What an annoying prick!\" Am I correct? And why do people give so much of a damn about him?\nAnswer: People are always going to care about celebrities. They live the kind of lifestyle we can only dream about. You obviously do give a damn about him thats why you are asking this question, in the first place.\n\nAnswer:",

Given millions of years, why are deers still running, caught, eaten, running again.....\\n\\nDo they STILL like the rush of being killed? \\n\\n(Humans evolved brains to out smart death by predators and for a few other reasons, then, why cant the \"others\" do the same?)\nAnswer: Because that would require drastic changes in their species.  Prey animals which are good at running have kids who are also good at running, and the best runners survive.  If they were to start evolving into an animal which is good at fighting, it would probably be not-so-good at running.  When the first few generations were born, they would be bad enough at running to get caught, but not good enough at fighting to kill the predators.  So no baby fighters.  Animals don't change a lot in one generation.  Evolution works over thousands of generations, and the in-between ones have to be viable for it to work.\n\nAnswer:",

Now, should I tell my boyfriend about it? I don't know how he's gonna react 'cause I take that long to tell him, is that considered cheating? or should I just forget about it.

Typically the only reason you would tell him is to make yourself feel better, and that's not necessary.  Honesty IS the best policy, but only if you plan on continuing this extra-curricular activity.  \\n\\nOn the other hand, if you feel you MUST tell him, be completely honest.

A more holistic approach has been favored by institutions such as the United Nations Development Program, which annually measures the Human Development Index (HDI) for a wide number of nations; the HDI is composed of three variables:\\n\\n1. GDP per capita, adjusted by PPP\\n2. Life expectancy at birth\\n3. Literacy proportion\\n\\nFor more info on GDP calculations and PPP, look them up in a macroeconomics textbook: Dornbusch, Fisher and Startz or Mankiw are good options.\n\nAnswer:",

Every woman has a color that she feels her best in. Seasons are not that important. For instance, darker hues may be used in the summer, but they may need to be avoided if the wedding will be out doors, as darker colors hold the heat. If you are going to be inside for the mast part, then knock yourself out. If you like Burgundy, but you are having an outdoor wedding then you should try a lighter hue and use your flowers and accessories to reflect your love of this color.\\n\\nThis is your wedding and the memories should last a lifetime.

I am pretty sure it was offered as low cost solution- and they are normally advanced years students- but still under teacher supervision. Check to see if you have a dental college in your area. Otherwise, some dentists will take people on a sliding scale. I have actually gotten dental loans thru my dentist with Wells Fargo before to get work done. You can also check with your areas health dept to see if they have any low-income programs.\n\nAnswer:",

Went in Friday afternoon, was gone by Sunday morning.\\n\\nIf he was dead for that long his body would have swelled up to an enormous size within that frame of time.

Peninsular Malaysia is on the mainland while East Malaysia is on Borneo, the largest islands in the region. However, Malaysia is often considered an archipelagic nation.\\n\\nGeologically the Malay archipelago is very interesting, being one of the most active vulcanological regions in the world. Geological uplifts in the region have also produced some impressive mountains, culminating in Mount Kinabalu in Sabah, Malaysia on the island of Borneo with a height of 4,101 metres (13,455 ft) and also Puncak Jaya in Irian Jaya, Indonesia at 4,884 metres (16,024 ft), on the island of New Guinea.\\n\\nThere are various conflicting territorial and/or maritime claims, both among these countries and even involving other parties (notably both Chinas in the case of the Spratly Islands).\\n\\nContrary to common misconception, most of the inhabitants of archipelagic Southeast Asia are not Pacific Islanders. However, it is worth noting that the eastern parts of Indonesia and Timor-Leste (east of Wallace line) are geographically parts of Oceania.\\n\\n[edit]\\nPopulation\\nSoutheast Asia has an area of approx. 4,000,000 km\u00b2 (1.6 million sq miles). As of 2004, more than 593 million people lived in the region, far over a sixth of them (+114 million) on the Indonesian island of Java, the most densely populated island in the world. The distribution of the religions and people is diverse in Southeast Asia and varies by country. And about 30 million Overseas Chinese are living here, most prominently Malaysia, Singapore and Thailand. see Chinatowns\\n\\n[edit]\\nEthnic groups in the subregion\\nSoutheast Asians are primarily of Asiatic stock. According to a recent Stanford genetic study, the Southeast Asian population is entirely far from being homogeneous. Although primarily descendants of Austronesian, Tai, and Mon-Khmer-speaking immigrants who migrated from Southern China during the Iron Age, there are overlays of Chinese, European, as well as Papuan genes.

What do I do? is it something to do with my IP address? How do i fix it?\nAnswer: You should have bought a router instead of a switch, the router does network address translation so that both computers can use the internet connection. However not all is lost. You can get away with some software solution. The easiest way is to run a proxy server on the computer that is able to connect to the internet and point the other computer's settings to use this proxy.\\n\\nSearch for free proxy servers such as AnalogX Proxy or 602Software Proxy, they are free and have manuals explaining how to set up internet conection sharing.

This object, opens up a connection to a Web server, transmits and receives data, then calls back the javascript on the page which was used to invoke it.\\n\\nWhat this means is that changes on the client side can communicate with the server, then dynamically update the client user interface without having to request a new Web page from the server.\\n\\nWhile this slightly complicates developing Web applications that use AJAX technologies (which, by the way, is just a name given to the various technologies employed to use this methodology), it makes for a very smooth user experience since they are not constantly refreshing Web pages.\\n\\nAJAX applications give an appearance of a 'thick client' application while still being a 'thin client' (i.e. application that runs in a Web browser.)  However, it is important to note that network communication is still going on in the background while the application is being used.\n\nAnswer:",

It was the best/easiest thing I could've done.  I was working full time, finishing up my Masters Degree, and trying to keep up with everyday life.\\n\\nTaking classes online allowed me the opportunity to work when it was convenient for me, which was mostly late at night.

A certain amount of participation was required (i.e. post 5 messages on the message board in one week).  Assignments had to be e-mailed to the profs.

I havent read about this brand properly but I seem to recall that its not as good as 'Breast Gain'. Anyone have an opinion on this brand? Its cheaper than the one Ive ordered.\nAnswer: The only definitive way to increase breast size is with surgery.

It seems like we've tried everything and nothings working. We've been trying for over 9 months now. I don't think we need to see a fertility doctor because we had no problems conceiving our first child. Any suggestions?\nAnswer: I assume your first pregnancy and birth went just fine, there's nothing that could have happened with your first baby to think there may be problems conceiving another one. \\nI know there is only a one week window each month in which a women can conceive, right after ovulation. Which is why OBGYN's tell you not to get worried until after a year or so of trying. I would recommend your husband wearing boxers (briefs constrict blood flow and keep their testicles too warm causing a lower sperm count). Changing your diet can make a difference too; avoid caffeine, nicotine, and liquor. Try reading Fertility Foods by Jeremy Groll. Over exercise can hinder ovulation in women also.\\nOther than that I would relax, don't worry too much about it, have some fun with the time you have together and all will come in due time.\\nGood luck!\n\nAnswer:",

But so does the Earth. I mean, when a meteor falls to Earth, it never flies back up, does it? People have this idea that black holes are somehow different because even light cannot escape their gravity. If light cannot escape, nothing else can either, so the black hole will eventually eat all the matter in the universe, right? Well, light can escape from Earth but nothing else can, at least not naturally. Meteors fall to Earth all the time and they have no rocket engines so they can never escape. This is true for any matter that falls to Earth. It can never escape. And the Earth is not eating all the matter in space, so why would you think a black hole would?\n\nAnswer:",

Keeping your area within certain specs.  You learn to be more aware of yourself.  Depending on your tech school (career choice), you may get more discipline there.

And how many units equals an Associates Degree? And Bachelors? And Masters? And Ph.D?\nAnswer: Depends on the University and the program, they are all different and measure units differently.  Northwestern measures units as individual classes so one class equals one credit, while other schools measure a credit hour based on how many hours of class you have each week in that class and so on.  For associates typically, 60 hours, Bachelors 120 hours.  A masters depends on the program and where you go.  A lot of masters degrees are 24-30 hours beyond a Bachelors but you can't take the same amount of classes at a time.  A Ph.D. can take from 3-7 years depending on the degree and program beyond your masters.  It all depends in what and where you go.\n\nAnswer:",

List the qualities of each in your examples.   For example, lets take Henry Fonda's character.  He was patient, did not make a snap judgement, and wanted to make sure he was doing it right due to the importance of the matter.  He discussed his opinion rather than force it on others and listened to those that had differing views rather than dismiss them.\n\nAnswer:",

They represent different grades of pencil.  I do a lot of pencil sketching and use many grades of pencil depending on the need and effect I'm looking for.\\n\\nIt's been my experience that the softer grades are great for contrast and shading. They're also good for darkening large areas of a drawing.  They do tend to \"cake up\" and smudge easily if too much is applied.\\n\\nThe harder grades are great for fine lines and when exact detailing is required.  They can hold a razor sharp point longer too.  Harder grades are okay for light shading but not very good when there's a need for a lot of high contrast darkening.\\n\\nThe following link shows a visual grading scale for reference.\\n\\nCheers\n\nAnswer:",

I exclaimed, How beautiful is this tree, and how delightful is its appearance!\" \\nIn western art, the fruit is most commonly depicted as an apple. One possible reason for this arises from a medieval pun. It was a source of humor to monks that the Latin term for evil (malus) was similar to the word of apple (malum). Thus it was often said that by eating the malum (apple), Eve contracted malus (evil). There is, however, no textual or historical evidence by which to argue the literalness of this image.\\n\\nJewish thought contains additional options. Rabbi Meir says: \"The fruit of (the Tree of Knowledge of Good-and-Evil) was a grape...\"; Rabbi Nechemia says: \"It was a fig...\"; Rabbi Yehuda says: \"It was wheat...\" Talmud, Brachot 40a\\n\\nThe reason it is sometimes surmised to have been a fig is that they used fig leaves to cover themself after eating it, either because the leaves were nearby, or because God creates the cure before the illness, and the same tree that caused the problem is also used to remedy it. Another explanation lies within the \"fruit\" of the fig tree, the fig itself, which is not actually a fruit but rather a flower of sorts, serving as the tree's genitalia. It is said that when they bit into the fig, they saw that what appeared to be a fruit on the outside had concealed the reproductive organs within itself. Adam and Eve then looked at each other and felt ashamed that their reproductive organs were simply exposed, and covered them with the large leaves from the same tree. Some commentators hold that it might have been a grape, and that Eve actually made, and drank, wine.\\n\\nEthno-botanists have proposed the iboga plant (Tabernanthe iboga) as the Tree of Knowledge. The ground up bark contains a dissociative substance, ibogaine, which has been traditionally used in Bwiti religious ceremony in Central Africa. Other hallucinogens, in particular the Fly agaric mushroom, have also been proposed as the Tree.\\n\\nChristian sects like the Coptics of Jamaica, and other peoples of faith, especially the Rastafarians believe it to be the Marijuana plant.\n\nAnswer:",

I have tried anthistamines, seen a doctor (all they said was we don't  know why). I can only stay in the water for at least 5 minutes if that.  I love swimming and with summer coming on I would love to go to the pool again.\\n\\nI can have a bath or shower and it doesn't affect me.\\nIs there anything I can take or do so I can go swimming. I have had the problem all my life and I am 52 now\nAnswer: The only option I can think of is buying one of those large backyard pools that you fill up yourself and use your hose to fill it up, since that water doesnt affect you. I am allergic to chlorine so I need antiheistamines whenever I go swimming in a pool, and sometimes even when I drink tap water that hasnt been filtered. I have no problem in the ocean or river though. Rivers are fresh water and are generally cleaner than the water we drink. I cant stand the salt in ocean water and can react to that too though.

It is originally from a science fiction story called \"R.U.R. (Rossum's Universal Robots)\" by Karel \u010capek. The word is probably based on \"... the verb robotovat, meaning \"to work\" or \"to slave\", and the noun robota (meaning corv\u00e9e) used in the Czech and Slovak languages\" (see the wikipedia entry below)\\n\\nThe generally accepted modern definition is \"...any machine which mimics the actions of a human (biomimicry), in the physical sense or in the mental sense.\"\\n\\nCheck out the wikipedia entry, below.\n\nAnswer:",

I can only hold on for 2 min max! So if anybody can give me a few pointers I'd really apperciate it! Thank you this means alot to me and my girlfriend.\nAnswer: You need to do kegel exercises and think about everything else other than sex.  When you are at the brink, stop, and do something else, like eat her out.  Do a couple of Kegel pumps and you'll control the urge and you're ready for another 5 minutes or so.  Keep doing it until you're ready.  Caution, after years of Kegel exercises, you will shoot, shoot up to 6 feet so be very careful where you point.\n\nAnswer:",

The question is, how hard is that?\\n\\nMore and more taxing authorities are putting property information on the web.  I live in New York, and counties are the primary property tax authority.  They have some fairly detailed property information, but sale prices only seem to be available for a few months after a sale closes.

We hadn't talked in about 5 months when she called me out of the blue, I forgave her and decided it might be worth trying to work out. Anyhow, one of my biggest pet peeves was that she never returned my phone calls and rarely picked up the phone...\\n\\nSoooo, I was waiting for her to give me a call last Saturday and didn't hear from her (no big surprise). I ended up going home with someone else. I've since avoided her like a plague.\\n\\nAt this point I'm numb over the issue but would really like to know what the hell she was thinking. Why even bother apologizing for everything to only come back and pull the same crap all over again? It really doesn't matter as the only thing I'm ever going to say to her again is \"SIGN THE DAMN PAPERS\" but I really feel she has sociopathic qualities and might need professional help.\\n\\nAny feedback is appreciated...\nAnswer: I'm going through the same thing.  Stay strong.  Stick with your gut feel.  She very well may be a sociopath but that's entirely up to her to get professional help.  My therapist outright told my wife to get help.  My wife insists there's nothing wrong with her.\n\nAnswer:",

Trapped dead air is a very good insulator because it prevents convection transfer of heat.\\n\\nA vacuum is also a good insulator and that is how a thermos bottle works.\\n\\nStyrafoam is another excellent insulator.\\n\\nThe higher the R value on an insulating product, the more heat that it will block.\\n\\nConsider this temperature gradient and heat flow:\\n\\nOutside it is 5\u00baF.  Inside it is 70\u00baF.  Over the span of 4 to 6\" in a normal wall, the temp gradient is 65 degrees!  What prevents all that heat from rushing outside?

I believe that more and more people of middle eastern back-round have been experiencing profiling.  I would hope that many police do not do it on purpose while I know many do.

Therefore a photographer's camera is nothing more than a darkened chamber that protects film from light exposure until you click and open an aperture to let the light (and view) in through the focusing lens just long enough to expose the film.  Usually you can wind the film to obtain a series of exposures on a roll of film.  The most expensive cameras often take only one picture but with remarkable clarity because of the very costly lenses and timing mechanisms.  These might be used to shoot the gatefold in color for a men's magazine, etc.  A disposable camera performs the same function for snapshots using barely adequate but inexpensive lenses with little control of the camera and photo possible.  Because it is mass-produced and not designed to be refilled with fresh film, it is cheap enough to use once and throw away (as in disposable).\n\nAnswer:",

Do you think America can go on like this bringing 'evil dictators' to justice?? What about the dictators who took refuge in USA??\nAnswer: The sad ending to this story is someone who will make Saddam look like Santa will become the new dictator and life will be much worse for the Iraqis- we already made it worse for them.  And no, I do not believe America should be the \"judge and jury\" for any sickos that pop up- we are hated by all countries now and targeted our country for every terrorist and wacko out there.  When you see a cesspool, you should already know what is in it, you do not need to stir it up to have the shit float to the top, that is what our government has done in Iraq.\n\nAnswer:",

I can see there is a lot of misunderstanding about diabetes.  The thing you need to know is that there are two types of diabetes.\\n\\nType 1 Diabetes presents more commonly during early childhood or early puberty but can occur at any age.  Type 1 specifically refers to diabetes resulting from the destruction of insulin-secreting cells in your pancreas.  All Type 1 diabetics require insulin because their body no longer makes it.\\n\\nType 2 Diabetes presents more commonly in adulthood but can occur at any age and is being seen in younger and younger patients.  Type 2 specifically refers to diabetes resulting from your body's becoming more resistant (or less sensitive) to the insulin that your pancreas produces.  Most patients can be treated with oral medications that improve your body's sensitivity to your endogenous insulin or stimulate more insulin release from your pancreas.  Type 2 diabetics have high levels of insulin circulating unlike Type 1 diabetics.  Some Type 2 diabetics may go on to need insulin if their oral medications are not adequately controlling their sugars; most will be on a combination of insulin and oral meds.\\n\\nBoth Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes are multifactorial.  There are both genetic and environmental factors that lead to the disease.  Therefore, just because one identical twin has diabetes (either kind) does not necessarily mean that the other will get it as well!\\n\\nPopulation studies have shown that for Type 1 diabetes...\\nIf your mom has Type 1 DM - your risk is 1 in 17\\nIf your mom has Type 1 DM and had you before age 25 - your risk 1 in 25\\nIf your mom has Type 1 DM and had you after age 25 - your risk 1 in 100\\nIf your mom got Type 1 DM before she was 11 - the above risk doubles\\nIf both your parents have Type 1 DM - your risk is 1 in 5\\n\\nFor Type 2 diabetes...\\nIf you have one parent who had Type 2 DM before 50 - your risk is 1 in 7\\nIf you have one parent who had Type 2 DM after 50 - your risk is 1 in 13\\nIf you have two parents with Type 2 DM - your risk is 1 in 2\\nIf you have an identical twin with Type 2 DM - your risk is 3 in 4\\n\\nThis information is all available from the American Diabetes Association.  As you can see, Type 2 diabetes actually has a higher inherited risk than Type 1!  There are things that you can do to minimize your chances of developing Type 2 DM, though, even though you are at risk.  That includes regular exercise, maintenance of a healthy weight, and reducing fat and calorie intake.  There are also some medications that can reduce your risk of developing Type 2 DM; you should talk to your doctor about whether these would be appropriate for you.  Above all, don't worry!  You are expressing concern about your health which is the FIRST STEP!  If you are motivated to take the appropriate steps towards maintaining your health, the odds of preventing diabetes are in your favor!!  Good luck!\\n\\nEDIT:\\nTo justwannaknow - I think what you say is misleading.  The AMA's recommendation in 2002 was for people to take a daily multivitamin.  There is still no recommendation for physicians to advise patients to take herbal supplements and other nutritional supplements like \"Glycoscience\".\\n\\nTo hmt42play - Islet cell transplants are not being recommended for patients with Type 2 diabetes!!!  As you diabetes educator, you should be aware of this!  Type 2 diabetics generally have functioning islet cells and DO produce insulin.  The problem is with insulin resistance so giving them more islet cells would not resolve the underlying problem.  Islet cell transplants are currently only being used in unstable Type 1 diabetics.  Please do not give this poor woman the idea that islet cell transplantation is a cure for Type 2 diabetes!\n\nAnswer:",

After all, I live near Reliant Stadium and met some very nice people but I also saw some trashing the parking lot near Fiesta and criticizing the efforts of citizens to help them (It wasn't enough or what they wanted). One night I wanted a sandwich from Subway and had to wait to be let in. They let me in when I told them I wanted to buy a sandwich. I also know people who work at the hotels and some of the evacuees tested their nerves. I guess what I want to say is let's help those who want to help themselves start over but the hand outs have to stop.

I don't think your status will affect your acceptance too much, unless English is a problem for you.  However, you will be asked to demonstrate how you are going to pay the tuition.  You will probably be asked to have a sponsor in the US, who will have to provide documentation that you are being supported financially and will not become a burden to society.\n\nAnswer:",

(im  hopin its a NO!)?\nAnswer: Not much. It's close enough to give Allen the right to a recount according to VA state law, but not really close enough for one to have much of a chance of changing the outcome.\\n\\nLast year there was a recount in the state attorney general election. The total # of votes was about the same as this election and the recount only shifted the count by about 35 votes, adding a bit to the winner's lead. Webb is ahead by about 7300 votes.\n\nAnswer:",

Here is the EXACT wording:\\n\\nCongress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances. \\n\\nIt says they cannot establish a religion or prohibit the exrcise of it, which is done all the time....you people need to get it right! Basically it says that Congress cannot make a state religion, it does not mean they have to do away with people practicing their religion.\n\nAnswer:",

I've read the \"Good Book\" a few times and every time I read it I keep coming up with questions.  \\n\\nI know a number of Jesus worshippers that have barely cracked the cover and they believe whole-heartedly.  Is my problem that I'm actually reading the words.  \\n\\nDo you think I should just close the book and just start having faith like the majority of Jesus worshippers?\nAnswer: Wrong question...you seem to think that an Athiest, if they read the bible a certain number of times, will \"see the light.\"  It doesn't work like that.  An athiest, or anyone fopr that matter, takes into account the evidence presented to them, and decides what is right for them.\\n\\nYour question is the same as this question...\"How many times does someone have to repeat \"1 plus 1 is 3\" before they really believe it?\"  Either it is right or it is wrong for a person, and re-reading a text does not make it (necessarily) more convincing.\n\nAnswer:",

Women inherit two X chromosomes -- one from each parent, written 46,XX.  Men inherit an X chromosome from their mothers and a Y chromosome from their fathers, written 46,XY.  Some individuals, however, have an additional X chromosome in their chromosomal arrangement, referred to as 47,XXY, or more commonly, just XXY.  The cause is unknown, yet XXY occurs in approximately 1 in every 500 to 1000 live male births, making it one of the most common chromosome variations.   The XXY variation is identified in an individual through a karyotype, a buccal smear, or FISH.\n\nAnswer:",

Good Luck!\\n\\nP.S. I don't know where some people are getting their facts, but it's not true that kids in public school do better than those in homeschool.

What sort of money per month should she ask for? He will be staying for a year with her.\nAnswer: Ask advice from the college where the French young man will be studying. He is bound to make comparisons with what everyone else pays.\\n\\nThere are three elements to the charge. The rent of a room. The food consumed. The acting as a landlady/in loco parentis: cooking food, doing laundry and cleaning: the extra work he creates for her, I would think the charges respectively should be \u00a360 a week, \u00a330 a week, \u00a330 a week as a minimum. \\n\\nThus \u00a3120 a week minimum and \u00a3150 a week would not be unreasonable.\n\nAnswer:",

Its best as an asset allocation.  It just depends on the percentage you should put in your portfolio.  I wouldnt put any more than 5-10 percent in it.  I dont think now is a good time to have a large percentage of oil in your portfolio.  Oil is a business of boom and bust cycles.  And I think we are about at the end of this boom part of the cycle.  Inventories are going up and drilling is still pretty strong.  I think oil will drop significantly in the next few months.  The only thing thats holding it up now I believe is politics, and this business with Iran.  Once that's over with I think the price of oil will go down.

These are often part of the large software programs they use to run the dealership. Car manufacturers also try to encourage loyalty by sending out coupons for service specials at local dealerships, for example. The more they can get you at the dealership, the more it will reinforce their name.

If you decide to go on reserve how much would you make?\nAnswer: First, you can't just decide to go on reserve.  Once your active enlistment is up, you can then enlist to serve in the reserves.  Reserve pay is dependent upon the number of drills you take part in.  If you are making 30k a year, you would have to be at least the rank of Sergeant (E-5) and have spent 8 years or more in the service. The same grade and time in service would net you about $330 for a weekend's worth of drill before taxes.\n\nAnswer:",

For example, the mineral magnetite is magnetic, and is found in lodestones. \\n\\nIf you have a magnet, you can stroke a piece of metal (not all metals, but some) and magnetize it; that is, turn it into a magnet. You line up the magnetic domains when you stroke it so it has a net magnetic field. If you put a radio reciever nearby tuned to the right frequency, you can hear the domains flip as you do this; this is called the Barkhausen effect. \\n\\nThere are also electromagnets. Passing an electric current through a coiled wire wrapped around the right kind of metal (called a shunt) produces a magnet. This is the kind of magnet one finds in MRI machines.\n\nAnswer:",

What happens in the eye when we do that?\nAnswer: there are little muscles above and below the lens of the eye, which, in profile, is shaped like an oval or elipse.  When those muscles are relaxed or flexed, the oval is either stretched or becomes shorter, changing the shape of the lens, thus manipulating lightrays (reflecting off of the thing we are \"seeing\") traveling through the lens, so that these rays (depending on the distance you are from what you're looking at and what you're doing with those muscles) are more focused or less focused in the retina.  If the light rays aren't focused correctly back there, then you've got a blurry image.  At least, that's what I THINK is going on if I remember correctly from a class I took last year....  So, in short, it's our ability to manipulate our eyes' lenses with those little muscles that makes us able to blur (or focus) our vision... good luck.\n\nAnswer:",

A challenge for cause asks the judge to excuse a potential juror because he or she appears to be biased or unable to be fair. ... A peremptory challenge can be used to excuse a potential juror for practically any reason other than the juror's race or gender. Lawyers have a limited number of peremptory challenges, typically no more than ten or twelve.\"\\nhttp://www.nolo.com/article.cfm/objectID/33D05B12-1208-491E-8AF9D48C675D04FB/104/308/214/QNA\\n\\nAt jury selection for the trial I reported for, I was the prosecution's first peremptory challenge. It was a personal injury lawsuit against a school district. My husband is a teacher. I was questioned for a long time--probably more than any other potential juror. I think the lawyer worried about me potentially alligning with the defense. I also am not afraid to speak my mind, though I consider myself a fair person.\\n\\nWhat's your story?\nAnswer: I had my door kicked in by the police and my house was destroyed during their search. They cut open my couch, put holes in my walls looking for drugs that were not there. \\n\\nThe address on the search warrant showed the house next door.\\nOOPS\\n\\nThen they arrested me an took me to jail for 20 hours to make sure \"that I couldn't tip off the neighbor that the warrant was really for\"\\n\\n\\n4 years later I just happened to get called for a jury duty with a case that was almost identical to what happened to me and quite frankly I would have voted to hang the police in that case.\n\nAnswer:",

It is one of the most common specific phobias. In survey research, six percent of the U.S. population claims to fear being sick, although a much smaller number suffer from actual emetophobia, which manifests itself through a variety of phobic behavior.\\n\\nNearly every emetophobic contracted their phobia as a result of a traumatic incident of vomiting that happened to them between the ages of six and ten. Most emetophobics claim they can will themselves to avoid vomiting, sometimes resulting in Irritable Bowel Syndrome, and other illness. A survey of an Internet group of emetophobics found that the average member had last vomited at least twelve years earlier. On average, it is suggested that most emetophobics have been sick five or fewer times in their lives.\\n\\nEmetophobics are known to go to great lengths to avoid people who may be sick, to avoid being in public places where people may do so, and above all, to practice eating habits in such a manner as to minimize the chance of their heaving - many emetophobics lead strict diet regimes and often avoid foods that are known to produce the most liekly chance of food poisoning - meat and dairy products for example. Most emetophobics have very specific diets, and avoid not only food that once caused them to vomit, but also anything they suspect of being a possible cause of such illness.\\n\\nAnxiety concerning vomiting, or being in close proximity to anyone that might vomit can cause irrational behaviour, and often induce panic attacks. Emetophobia can have a very difficult and stressful influence on everyday life, the very nature of the illness being ever present. Many emetophobics would rather face illness than face the fear of vomiting, and in almost every case, an emetophobics body would respond to this irrational fear. Most emetophobics fear vomiting themselves, but in some cases, it has been claimed that fear of seeing other people vomit can induce an even greater phobic response than if they were to be sick themselves/\\n\\nEmetophobia is treated in the way common to most specific phobias.\n\nAnswer:",

Make sure that the total is less than the ampere rating of the circuit breaker.  You should probably only use about 3/4 of the amperes the circuit breaker is rated for.  For example, a 20 Amp breaker should only be loaded with about 15 Amps.\\n\\nIf only the wattage of an appliance is given, divide the wattage by the voltage to obtain the amperes.  For example, a toaster may draw 1200 watts.  1200 watts / 120 V = 10 Amps.  A light bulb may draw 60 watts.  60 watts / 120 V = .5 Amps.\n\nAnswer:",

I've heard you can't be deployed twice within a certain time span, is that true? And how long did you spend there?\nAnswer: I don't know if there is an actual rule to that, but they way they make the deployment schedules, it's unlikely to go twice in a row.  In the USMC, it's been 7 months there before the new guys show up.  They stay for seven months.  It's possible that as soon as you return, you'll start training to go back as the new guys replacements.  But that is what I am trying to do, and I am having a difficult time being put on a deployment.  There are more Marines willing to go than slots available.  Many Marines have gotten to go/had to go three times in one enlistment.  I've only gotten there once.  I've got a year left though.  Hopefully I'll make it back again.\n\nAnswer:",

What impresses you the most about the games and will you continue watching soccer once the World cup is over?\nAnswer: No!  I have been watching the World Cup since 1990.  I went to the World Cup when the finals were at the Rose Bowl in Pasadena.  Sat in the second row, 50 yard line.  It's been an up and down of emotions these past years.  The thing that impresses me the most is the competition of teams when they play.  Each country does not want to let their country down by losing so they play hard.  I hope Ronaldo gets to play the next game for Brazil.  What do you think of the USA's opening game this past Monday?  Yes, I will keep watching the World Cup.  I have been playing soccer since 5 yrs. old.\n\nAnswer:",

Do anyone think that this is going to hold me back what shoud I do? should I go and take my GRE and GMAT and score high(in hopes to compensate for the missing point)? or should I take a class over(can I do that?seeings that i graduated already) or maybe just go for another Balchelor? \\n\\nAdvice is greatly appreciated.\nAnswer: I'll assume, since you plan to take the GMAT, that you're applying for an MBA program. Just do it. Apply to the grad schools. Anything even close to a 3.0 is considered pretty damn good by grad schools, as long as you have good recommendation letters and you're not a lazy bum.

If we had an idealized 'stasis field' (a container or defined zone in which time could be prevented from passing), we might be able to perform experiments to determine whether the things inside were still subject to entropy or whether they were removed from the general entropy gradient. The current prevailing theories hold that the contents of a stasis field (or container) are unaffected by entropy. This leads to the concept that entropy might be stripped from the events which cause it and transferred from object to object or from place to place, leading to unexpected catastrophes for no apparent cause. Once more, these things are difficult to determine.\n\nAnswer:",

Unless they\u2019ve broken a criminal law, internal affairs can\u2019t do anything.  If you\u2019re talking about a false arrest or getting caught in a sting operation, the best recourse is to appeal the conviction.   Almost 100% of the time the lower courts will side with the police officer, but in the appeals court, the decision often swings toward the plaintiff.\\n\\nFabricating lies and spreading them with the intention of causing harm to another person is a civil matter.  Slander and libel are difficult to prove.  First you must prove the person is lying, then you must prove they are spreading those lies with the sole intention of hurting you and then you must prove those lies have caused you to lose something i.e.: a job, money, your home, etc.  Call an attorney and see if you have a case, but chances are, you can\u2019t do anything.\\n\\nIf you have a video tape which contradicts even one sentence of the police report, you should appeal the case in a higher court.  All you have to do is catch them in one little lie to have the whole thing thrown out of court.\n\nAnswer:",

I need some examples of either so I can better understand the concepts in real-life or real-world scenarios.\nAnswer: 1.  The von Bertalanffy growth function (VBGF) introduced by von Bertalanffy in 1938 predicts the length of a shark as a function of its age, L = L(t): L(t) = Loo - (Loo - Lo) exp(-kt) \\n2.  Examples of exponential growth\\nBiology. \\nMicroorganisms in a culture dish will grow exponentially, at first, after the first microorganism appears (but then logistically until the available food is exhausted, when growth stops). \\nA virus (SARS, West Nile, smallpox) of sufficient infectivity (k > 0) will spread exponentially at first, if no artificial immunization is available. Each infected person can infect multiple new people. \\nHuman population, if the number of births and deaths per person per year were to remain constant (but also see logistic growth). \\nMany responses of living beings to stimuli, including human perception, are logarithmic responses, which are the inverse of exponential responses; the loudness and frequency of sound are perceived logarithmically, even with very faint stimulus, within the limits of perception. This is the reason that exponentially increasing the brightness of visual stimuli is perceived by humans as a smooth (linear) increase, rather than an exponential increase. This has survival value. Generally it is important for the organisms to respond to stimuli in a wide range of levels, from very low levels, to very high levels, while the accuracy of the estimation of differences at high levels of stimulus is much less important for survival. \\nElectroengineering \\nCharging and discharging of capacitors and changes in current in inductors are also exponential growth and decay phenomena. Engineers use a rule of five time constants to estimate when a steady state has been reached. \\nComputer technology \\nProcessing power of computers. See also Moore's law and technological singularity (under exponential growth, there are no such singularities). \\nInternet traffic growth. \\nWikipedia:Modelling Wikipedia's growth - an analysis of Wikipedia's growth rates based on article growth rates and other statistics \\nInvestment. The effect of compound interest over many years has a substantial effect on savings and a person's ability to retire. See also rule of 72 \\nPhysics \\nAtmospheric pressure decreases exponentially with increasing height above sea level, at a rate of about 12% per 1000m. \\nNuclear chain reaction (the concept behind nuclear weapons). Each uranium nucleus that undergoes fission produces multiple neutrons, each of which can be absorbed by adjacent uranium atoms, causing them to fission in turn. If the probability of neutron absorption exceeds the probability of neutron escape (a function of the shape and mass of the uranium), k > 0 and so the production rate of neutrons and induced uranium fissions increases exponentially, in an uncontrolled reaction. \\nNewton's law of cooling  where T is temperature, t is time, and, A, D, and k > 0 are constants, is an example of exponential decay. \\nMulti-level marketing \\nExponential increases appear in each level of a starting member's downline as each subsequent member recruits more people.\n\nAnswer:",

Is it just their ego rocking back and forth in their head that makes the rest of their body sway like a penguin when they walk? I can understand guys with big legs, but why do guys with average size legs act like their so big when they're not? is it wishful thinking for them? who else thinks it's both of those things?\nAnswer: The muscles have swollen to an unnatural size and cannot work properly with the regular amount of blood so they take blood from the brain.  This turns the thick-necked cretin into a swaggering moron as his sense of reason and balance have both been badly affected.  \\nHis brain has shrunk so much that it will now operate in much the same way as a lobsters brain - all it wants to do is eat, drink, fight and mate.\n\nAnswer:",

I am trying to do that myself.  It has taken me about a month of being on my own to actually be able to look back and realize little things in our relationship that could have been better, and that is helping.

NT books were chosen with an agenda to make Christianity the dominant religion in Rome. If you disagree, why? Please, no vague answers. No, \"Satan spread doubt\" or \"Lies!  All lies!\".  I want to know WHY you do or don't trust the history, and WHY you believe your own opinion.  I'm looking to promote thought, not ignorance.\nAnswer: I have faith that the Bible really was written via the INFLUENCE of the Abrahamic god, but not necessarily at the time it was written. It didn't start being actually put into written text until centuries after the life of Jesus, and therefore MUST have been shared through oral tradition over generations. As that CAN be a reliable source of information, on the other hand, did you ever play \"Telephone\" in elementary school: one person says a sentence or phrase into one person's ear, and that person repeats what they heard to the next person, and than that person repeats it to the next person, and so on, and it never comes out exactly how it started. Maybe Yahweh started the game, and after generations of playing \"Telephone,\" it just got a little mangled.\\n\\nPlus, have you ever tried to translate anything EXACTLY from one language to another? It can't be done: words that exist in some languages don't exist in others, and vice versa; not to mention the varying sentence structure from language to language.\\n\\nThen, of course, the Roman Catholics had to go and alter it for their own control-the-masses power hype, and screwed it up even more. Let's face it: we're human. We\u2019re fallible, and so is the Bible.\n\nAnswer:",

For a plane that flew into the ground, Flight 93 left a rather widespread debris field. Investigators found a second debris field three miles away from the main crash site at Indian Lake, and a third debris field in New Baltimore, eight miles away. NTSB officials suggested that the debris at these distant locations blew there in the wind after the crash, but eyewitnesses at Indian Lake saw the debris falling out of the sky like confetti. One of the engines was 600 feet from the main debris field by some accounts and a mile by others. The eyewitness accounts are consistent with a missile strike and not with a plane being flown into the ground. Why will they not release details of what the black box told them? Why did Air Traffic Controllers in a Nashua Telegraph article report an F-16 was circling Flight 93 and was in visual range at the time?\nAnswer: The film \"Flight 93\" will likely follow the media's portrayal of the event. Personally, it's a beautiful story of human courage, but it's simply implausible. All those people getting through on their cell phones? From an altitude of 30,000 feet? With all the conceivable cell phone traffic already on the airwaves generated by the days events? It's preposterous, but I would be well impressed if the forthcoming film would delve into these possibilities.\n\nAnswer:",

People normally breathe in their chest. You can tell if you're using chest breathing because your shoulders rise and fall. With diaphragm breathing it is the stomach region that moves. Diaphragm breathing is a much deeper breathing than chest breathing. It is also quite difficult to achieve properly. \\n\\nTo manage it, you have to take a slow, deep breath, remembering not to move your chest. Do it standing or lying down; you have to make a conscious effort to get the air into your stomach (this doesn't really happen, but it feels like it. The reason diaphragmatic breathing gets more air into you is that the diaphragm muscle stretches the lungs so that most of them fill up with air. It helps to have a hand on your stomach, or to have someone watching you and telling you that you're moving your shoulders. You can also lie down and put a pile of books on your stomach, so that you can see whenever they rise or fall. When you breathe out, try to keep your stomach (and the books) up, by keeping the diaphragm tense.\\n\\nIt's quite difficult, but practice makes perfect. :)\\n\\nP.S.: \"Many Mockingbirds are actually mimicking Cell Phone ring-tones now.\"\\n\\nLol snagelfritz!!!

If the members are already DJ's to begin with, join their names with an ampersand. For example, DJ Kyle and DJ Tomasio would name themselves \"KYLE & TOMASIO\".\\n\\n3. Or gibberish, but making reference to clubs, records, electronic instruments, or drugs etc. For example, you can call it \"VINYL FLOOR GROOVERS\" or \"VINYL METH GROOVERS\".\\n\\n4. If you are German or Italian, just use your name:  JOHANN VAN KELLER. People instantly will assume you're good.\\n\\n5. Three capital letters that look well together.

As it's thrown outside, it starts to move faster (when things move in a circle, the things that are nearer the outside move faster than things near the center; you can see this if you have a \"old-fashioned\" record player by putting two coins on it, one near the center and one near the outer edge and trace how long it takes them to complete the lengths of their paths). So the circling water near the outer rim is moving very fast and experiences bigger forces (since the force is proportional to velocity). But the water near the middle is moving slower because it's being dragged along the bottom and so ends up slowing down much more. Since the water near the bottom is moving so slowly, it exhibits a much lower centrifugal force and so there is little to no centrifugal force near the bottom (or middle). This is why you have a whirlpool (vortex): the water near the top is pushed out more (since there's higher centrifugal force there) and the water near the bottom is hardly pushed outward at all (since there's lower centrifugal force near the bottom to push it out).\n\nAnswer:",

However, if this is some type of business (home or otherwise) then you will need to purchase one of the other AVG versions (if not then you can use the Free version).\\n\\nThe best way to clean your computer is to use CCleaner, http://www.ccleaner.com/ which will remove junk files and clean out the cookies and temporary internet files.  It does a better job than the Windows disk cleaner.  It also has a scanner to remove old registry entries as well (a must if you have installed/uninstalled a lot of programs).\n\nAnswer:",

If thats not the problem try deleting and redownloading Yahoo. I recommend you do that every couple of months anyway because Yahoo is odd sometimes and errors occur.

If it is very out of shape and being forced to run, 30min to 1 hour MAX, but it would need TLC and lots of rest before it would be able to be used (even for walking) again.\\nI've tested my 12yr (prime age) VERY FIT endurance horse and with (1min breaks to save my legs) she was able to go for aprox. 3 hrs. She needed a VERY LONG rest and intensive care afterward.\\nWestern movies tend to exagerate things. The riders of the pony express would start off on one horse and either pass their mail onto another horse & rider team at a check point or he would be given a new horse and continue on. To run all day like that would easily kill a horse.\n\nAnswer:",

He was probably wrong about that, see articles on dark energy to learn why. Since Energy is expressed in joules which is a measure of work - moving one newton of mass one meter-, a measurement in meters per second was needed for the energy equation to solve with the proper units. Einstein believed that the square of the speed of light would account for the most extreme accleration possible and therefore would produce the highest theoretical yield of energy. At least that's what a lot of scientists think Einstein thought. Not a lot of people have had the capacity to think like Einstein so we are all just guessing from his speeches, writings, and calculations what he really thought.\n\nAnswer:",

But that could be because I used to be a weightlifter.  I already had the muscle there, it just went flat.  So when I did it, I immediately noticed results.  Also with pilates, you really have to concentrate and pull the muscles in, in order for it to work.  If you don't feel tension in your core when you are doing pilates, then you're probably not doing them right.  It's hard to do them from a video if you are an exercise beginner.  Also, pilates is for toning muscle, it really won't help with weight loss like walking or jogging, simply because it's not raising your heartrate enough to burn the fat.\n\nAnswer:",

The violence inhibition mechanism (VIM) is considered to be a functionally similar mechanism in humans where sad facial affects (distress cues) function as a human submission response. At its simplest, the VIM is thought to be a system that when activated by distress cues, the sad and fearful expressions of others, results in increased autonomic activity, attention and activation of the brain stem threat response system (usually resulting in freezing).43 According to the model, moral socialisation occurs through the pairing of the activation of the mechanism by distress cues with representations of the acts which caused the distress cues (moral transgressionsfor example, one person hitting another).43 A process of classical conditioning results in these representations of moral transgressions becoming triggers for the mechanism. The appropriately developing child thus initially finds the pain of others' aversive and then, through socialisation, thoughts of acts that cause pain to others aversive also. \\n\\nBlair has proposed that psychopathic persons have had disruption to this system such that representations of acts that cause harm to others do not become triggers for the VIM.43 This is thought to occur because the signal to the learning system concerning emotionally aversive stimuli is mutedthat is, the unconditioned stimulus (US) signal is diminished, thus impairing the formation of US-conditioned stimulus (CS) associations. Certainly, the autonomic response of psychopathic persons to the aversive US of sad and fearful facial expressions is muted relative to controls.34 At the neural level, this has been attributed to dysfunction within the amygdala.23 47\n\nAnswer:",

An engagement party is supposed to be the affair when your engagement is announced to your friends and family (except for your immediate family who should already know). Most people have started using an engagement party as an excuse for gifts since everyone invited already knows, which is just tacky. You don't have an engagement party if everyone already know your engaged. Traditionally the bride's parents host an engagement party. The bride's mother sends out invites to a dinner party or barbeque or luncheon, whatever type of party it's going to be. The bride's father announces the engagement at some point during the beginning of the party.\n\nAnswer:",

Today, only a century later, we are about 6.3 billion.\\nResources don't multiply as people, so technique has to do it.\\nGMOs started mostly because the pressure of those countries who give subsidies over the price, making profits disappear for those who produce crops.\\nRR Soybean, the most famous GMO, for example, was obtained not by modifying the DNA chain as most people think, but adding cytoplasmic DNA, which only enters in action when needed to syntethize sulfur amino acids, so its DNA remains untouched and has no risk of developing diseases in the future as Greenies think.\n\nAnswer:",

Various verses are cited (out of context) and the verses that people use to show that homosexuality is wrong are explained away.  The world wants to change God's words and meanings into something more suitable to its sinful desires.  Nevertheless, the truth stands:  The Bible condemns homosexuality as a sin. Let's look at what it says. \\n\\nLev. 18:22, \"You shall not lie with a male as one lies with a female; it is an abomination.\" \\n\\nLev. 20:13, \"If there is a man who lies with a male as those who lie with a woman, both of them have committed a detestable act; they shall surely be put to death. Their bloodguiltness is upon them\" \\n\\n1 Cor. 6:9-10, \"Or do you not know that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived; neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor homosexuals, 10nor thieves, nor the covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor swindlers, shall inherit the kingdom of God.\" \\n\\nRom. 1:26-28, \"For this reason God gave them over to degrading passions; for their women exchanged the natural function for that which is unnatural, 27and in the same way also the men abandoned the natural function of the woman and burned in their desire toward one another, men with men committing indecent acts and receiving in their own persons the due penalty of their error. 28And just as they did not see fit to acknowledge God any longer, God gave them over to a depraved mind, to do those things which are not proper.\" \\n\\n      Homosexuality is clearly condemned by the Bible.   It goes against the created order of God.  He created Adam and then made a woman.  This is what God has ordained and it is what is right.  Unlike other sins, homosexuality has a severe judgment administered by God Himself. This judgment is simple: They are given over to their passions. That means that their hearts are allowed to be hardened by their sins (Romans 1:18ff). As a result, they can no longer see the error of what they are doing. Without an awareness of their sinfulness, there will be no repentance and trusting in Jesus. Without Jesus, they will have no forgiveness. Without forgiveness, there is no salvation. \\n\\nWhat should be the Christian's Response to the Homosexual? \\n\\n      Just because someone is a homosexual does not mean that we cannot love him (or her) or pray for him (her). Homosexuality is a sin and like any other sin, it needs to be dealt with in the only way possible. It needs to be laid at the cross, repented of, and never done again. \\n      As a Christian, you should pray for the salvation of the homosexual the same you would any other person in sin. The homosexual is still made in the image of God -- even though he is in grave sin.  Therefore, you should show him same dignity as anyone else you come in contact with. However, this does not mean that you are to approve of their sin. Don't compromise your witness for a socially acceptable opinion that is void of godliness.\nAnswer: If I give you that the bible does seem to indicate that homosexuality is NOT a preferred activity for men (although women are never mentioned in this  context)...\\n\\nCan you give me the fact it is not one of the 10 commandments and thus not one of the mortal sins and thus is a venial (lesser) sin.\\n\\nAND the fact that we accept and seemingly encourage intentional violation of the mortal sins and the 10 Commandments.\\n\\nIn the sake of time, I will just point out two...\\n\\n5th Commandment: Thou Shalt Not Kill.\\n- WE still sentence criminals to death & send soldiers to kill innocents\\n\\n10th Commandment: Thou Shalt not Covet thy Neighbor's Property.\\n- Do we not encourage avarice and envy through fashion, fads, marketing, and waste?\\n\\nThe issue is, Humans are flawed, we kill, steal, have greed, sloth, and much, much more. \\n\\nAs long as you hold 100% true to your beliefs, and REFUSE to support leaders who send troops to kill, encourage greed, do not believe in charity, encourage us to shop to fight terrorists, et al, then I will back you 100% in any argument you make supporting the teachings of the bible. \\n\\nI have complete respect for an enlightened person willing to not be selective in THEIR views as well and not spout a \"socially acceptable opinion that is void of godliness\"\n\nAnswer:",

Conservatives resisted change, went by the rules and were generally thought of as stodgy old men smoking cigars at 'the club'.\\nLiberals, on the otherhand, were \"for the people\", hippy-generation types. Always looking to change the world.\\n\\nWhen I look at the news and political terrain of today, I see that Liberals are about on par with calling someone a Communist in the McCarthy Era. The Conservatives of today seem quite a bit more militant and bent of rewriting history and our constitution in one fell swoop.\\nI do not consider myself either. I like to think I'm like the American Majority...being a Middle of the Road type of guy. I dont agree with either side and it disturbs me that the system is so far out of balance.\nAnswer: I think really it depends on what camp you talk to as far as bad and good. People I work with can't stand Neocons...and I try to be well balanced but tend to lean more toward being a Neocon. Needless to say I keep my thoughts on any political matters to myself, because I don't feel strongly enough to have it interfere with a job I like.\\n\\nDeep down I just wish people could agree to disagree and just get along.

The species has a jade green color to the leaves, and some species can also develop a red tinge on the edges of leaves when exposed to high levels of sunlight. The growth pattern and structure of the succulent is evenly distributed. Dependent on the environment in which it is in, the plant produces small white or pink star like flowers that adorn the ends of new stalks in the Spring.\\n*Some called  Lunaria annua money plant.\n\nAnswer:",

I've been on websites with facts-i havent been to the Dr. yet.-but i want some personalized facts...thanks guys!!!\nAnswer: I am a sex counselor who goes to schools teaching students about the risk of sex.

Early signs may include: a yellow or whit discharge for the penis of vagina. pain or burning when urinating. Women may also have pain in the lower abdomen or bleeding between periods (this symptom may not be gonorrhea so, you should see a doctor.)\n\nAnswer:",

It seems so unresonable that when you are late for a few weeks, then they can increase the fine 2 or 3 times more of the original amount\nAnswer: You should have had reminders in the post for out parking fine before the bailiffs showed up....\\n\\nBailiffs can charge you up to \u00a350 per visit, plus a fee for their time. Fees are currently not regulated and are merely expected to be 'reasonable', although there isn't really any guidelines on what' reasonble' is.

When you go into the splits try to focus on sitting up straight or even bending back to try to touch your back leg. Scorpions are all in split flexability and back flexability, so do back bend (or bridges) whatever you call them too. If your problem is just that you cant pull it close enough to your head try slipping a band around your ankle and pulling it to your head that way. \\n\\nMost importantly though, just make sure you aren't forcing it. I know you say you need to have it soon, but its not worth injuring yourself over it since there are many other cool lib variations you can try. Change it to stretches, or maybe even scales. It may not come over night, but if you keep working hard and stretching, eventually your scorp will come.\n\nAnswer:",

Try a sporting advent or museum, and if funds are low go to the park or bike path get out and do things. You are more likely to meet someone who has the same interests and possibly even has kids. Make sure you keep good body language and make eye contract to let men know you are available.  And if you don't meet someone you have just spent a great day with your child. Maybe you have better luck next time. Pray that God brings you the person you are supposed to be with and that he conditions you so you are ready to meet him.\n\nAnswer:",

Last year in May, we traded in the Saturn SW1 station wagon for a 2005 Prius, again because Detroit did not produce what we felt was appropriate to mitigate the fuel crunch crisis.\\n\\nIt will likely be a few more years before Detroit comes around; they made the choice themselves, even asking Bush to kill the Partnership for a New Generation of Vehicles program, where they had produced prototypes of family cars that achieved over 70 mpg.  But they wouldn't make as high a profit margin as SUVs, so the Big 3 continued their role as pushers for the growing ranks of addicts.

If you registered for the marathon in advance and had a time less than 3 hours, 4 hours, or 5 hours, you were eligible to be in special corralls that started ahead of the pack.\n\nAnswer:",

I don't even know if I'm supposed to send a sample writing (part of the story) for their review. As each type of story is different the style of writing would differ.  Is an editor an absolute requirement to a publisher? Grammar is one thing but style is another so I'm confused as to why the editor.\\nTHANKS FOR YOUR ANSWER!\nAnswer: There are many routes you can take. I tend to send clients the route less traveled as you have a better chance of getting picked up.  Most say you need an agent, and yes that is true if you want to be published by Powerhouse or other Large Publishing company.  However, they often pass on great books because they have so many in progress.  I manage writers, poets, models, and musicians. For all my writers I send them to small publishing houses first. I currently have a client and friend signed to YinSumi Press (www.yinsumi.com) at first I was hesistant to send her but they gave the best long term deal.  It is ran by people who have worked in the entertainment industry for over 15 years. So they already have her doing speaking engagements and her book doesn't go to press until August. Plus she will earn more than the larger publishing house was offering her.  They are a small publshing house with all the connections of a large publishing house. You might want to check them out. But if you do choose to go to a large publishing house, please get an agent and be patient, it may take years before anyone picks up your story.\n\nAnswer:",

Instead of CVs and resumes, wouldn't it be better if we hired people based on their skills, but also on their personalities, like their qualities as a person?  Most people, if it's their field have something to offer in the workplace.  I never want to feel I'm \"beating out\" or better than someone else.\nAnswer: I think American society is way too competitive, but I guess I'd rather have people earn things through education and experiance rather than all the people who get by on someone else's achievements, like a kid riding on his/her parents hard work, But it gets kind of scary when I heard about parents trying to get their baby into the most 'prestigious' pre-school?! thats scary man\n\nAnswer:",

They can be distinguished because they have different masses (from a different number of neutrons in the nucleus). But this effect is usually very small. One exception is hydrogen. The isotope consisting of one protoon and one neutron in the nucleus (deuterium) has double the mass of a regular hydrogen atom, and this can have observable effects even on the chemistry.\n\nAnswer:",

But there is hope. Internet radio is gaining popularity daily with the general public partly because listeners know they can listen to independent artists that commercial radio refuses to play. And Internet radio is probably where you should start. \\nI'm assuming you have the finished product. If you have an mp3 of your song(s), then register with Myspace as an artist. Upload your songs and then search for record labels, broadcasters, bands and regular members to listen to your songs.\\nIf a broadcaster likes it, they'll pick it for rotation. How do I know this? I'm an Internet radio broadcaster and I review and play quality independent artist's music.\\nIf it's really popular with the Internet community, I think it'll eventually make it to commercial radio.\n\nAnswer:",

That's because a Dynamic IP does not guarantee a machine will keep the same IP all the time, and if a server/service provider changes IP, the clients may not be able to find it.  \\n\\nIt's the same for the Internet--- if people/web clients/whatever external computer will be coming to your computer to retrieve information or services, it has to be able to find the resource.  \\n\\nThis is usually facilitated by DNS which keeps track of server/service names and their corresponding IP's; DNS updates to client machines is sometimes slow, so the clients may go looking in the old location (old IP) if the server changes IP, and the DNS updates themselves may be done manually so the DNS server may not even be aware that your server has changed IP.\n\nAnswer:",

It doesn't really hurt.. maybe a litle bit in the shower.  It has been fine for the past 3 months, so I don't know why this happened.  Could it be an infection?\nAnswer: Its more than likely drainage from the incision under the scar tissue, possibly with a little infection. Have your doctor look at it. S/he will probably just drain it and possibly give you an  antibiotic. Probably nothing to worry about but if its not going away you should have someone check it out. If there is continuing infection under the scar tissue it could go systemic and that would put your vital organs at risk.\n\nAnswer:",

Along with that though, our Constitutional rights have been completely stripped and suspended without a whisper from the mainstream press.

Many cultures have certain food groups that are known to be most beneficial to the growth, health, and longevity of we the people, and with a combined educational and medical program people living under these conditions generally do much better than in other parts of the world where such requirements are non-exsistant.\\n\\nI believe doctors are quite sensitive when it comes to lifestyle issues, particular lifestyle changes culture to culture, or simply topographically. In closing it's important to remember that no matter what resources and qualities are available to all, one has to take the initiative to act upon their own personal requirements and conditional factors to maximize a standardized outcome.\n\nAnswer:",

What is a good College Major?\nAnswer: Inorder to truely find a major that is the \"most useful\" or \"best\" you have to decide what you really like doing.  Do you want to work with people or work best alone and with machines?  That is the first place to start.  If you enjoy people or building things then I would go with business or organizational psychology.  Both will help you to relate to people and build a strong cohesive business.

WHY???\nAnswer: Rust is the substance formed when iron compounds corrode in the presence of oxygen and water. It is a mixture of iron oxides and hydroxides. Rusting is a common term for corrosion, and usually corrosion of steel.\\n\\nIron is found naturally in the ore haematite as iron oxide, and metallic iron tends to return to a similar state when exposed to air, (hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, etc.) and water. This corrosion is due to the oxidation reaction when iron metal returns to an energetically favourable state. Energy is given off when rust forms. The process of rusting can be summarized as three basic stages: The formation of iron(II) ions from the metal; the formation of hydroxide ions; and their reaction together, with the addition of oxygen, to create rust.\\n\\nIron is the main component of steel and the corrosion of steel is observed more frequently, since iron is rarely used without alloying in the present day.\\n\\nWhen steel contacts water, an electrochemical process starts. On the surface of the metal, iron is oxidized to iron(II):\\n\\n    Fe \u2192 Fe2+ + 2e\u2212\\n\\nThe electrons released travel to the edges of the water droplet, where there is plenty of dissolved oxygen. They reduce the oxygen and water to hydroxide ions:\\n\\n    4e\u2212 + O2 + 2H2O \u2192 4OH\u2212\\n\\nThe hydroxide ions react with the iron(II) ions and more dissolved oxygen to form iron oxide. The hydration is variable, however in its most general form:\\n\\n    Fe2+ + 2OH\u2212 \u2192 Fe(OH)2\\n    4Fe(OH)2 + O2 \u2192 2(Fe2O3.xH2O) + 2H2O\\n\\nHence, rust is hydrated iron(III) oxide. Corrosion tends to progress faster in seawater than fresh water due to higher concentration of sodium chloride ions, making the solution more conductive. Rusting is also accelerated in the presence of acids, but inhibited by alkalis. Rust can often be removed through electrolysis, however the base metal object can not be restored through this method.\n\nAnswer:",

Is that a fact?\nAnswer: Hi Kevin\\n\\nHere are a few ideas on how to heal your condition.\\n\\nCause\\n\\nNutrient deficiencies, thyroid disorders, and stress can all contribute to epileptic seizures and must be screened for and addressed as part of a comprehensive treatment approach. Proper bowel movements two to three times a day are also important. If necessary, consider a bowel cleanse to restore healthy bowel function. \\n\\nPioneering holistic dentist Hal Huggins, D.D.S., has noted the improvement, and in some cases the complete disappearance of epilepsy symptoms after removing toxic dental amalgams. If you have such amalgams in your mouth, consider having them replaced by someone properly trained in Holistic Dentistry. \\n\\nCaution: If the individual's seizure does not stop within 5-10 minutes, seek immediate medical assistance. At the same time, be sure not to over-drug the patient, as medical drugs can actually trigger epilepsy due to their potential side effects.\\n\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nNatural Cures\\n\\nDiet: Individuals affected by epilepsy should eat a low-fat, low-carbohydrate diet, and eliminate fried foods, salt, sugar, meat, milk, and alcohol. For long-term care, they should follow a hypoglycemic diet (see Hypoglycemia), being sure to avoid artificial sweeteners, excessive refined carbohydrates, and caffeine. For epilepsy accompanied by sluggish bowels or constipation, also ensure that the diet is rich with fibrous foods. \\n\\nEmergency Techniques You Can Use When Someone Is Having A Seizure: Remain calm and move sharp objects away from the affected individual. Keep him or her from putting anything in the mouth, and loosen his or her clothing. If possible, put the person on the floor or bed and stay at the individual's side until the episode runs its course. \\n\\nHerbs: For petit mal epilepsy, take one teaspoon of skullcap tincture three times a day. \\n\\nHydrotherapy: Hydrotherapy is the application of water, ice, steam and hot and cold temperatures to maintain and restore health. Treatments include full body immersion, steam baths, saunas, sitz baths, colonic irrigation and the application of hot and/or cold compresses. Hydrotherapy is effective for treating a wide range of conditions and can easily be used in the home as part of a self-care program. Many Naturopathic Physicians, Physical Therapists and Day Spas use Hydrotherapy as part of treatment. I suggest several at-home hydrotherapy treatments. \\n\\nJuice Therapy: Drink a combination of celery, carrot, and lettuce juice three times a day.\\n\\nNutritional Supplementation: The following nutrients can help minimize symptoms of epilepsy: L-taurine and L-tyrosine amino acids (500 mg three times daily) along with an amino acid blend (two times daily); vitamin B complex and vitamins B3 (niacin), B5, B6 and B12; calcium; choline (start with 4 g daily and increase to 10-12 g within three months); dimethyl glycine (100 mg two times daily); magnesium; manganese; and zinc. Vitamin B complex injected intramuscularly may also be helpful.\\n\\nNote: Sometimes essential fatty acids aggravate symptoms, so consult with a nutritional expert to determine if this is the case.\\n\\nAlternative Professional Care\\nIf your symptoms persist despite the above measures, seek the help of a qualified health professional. The following professional care therapies have all been shown to be useful for treating and relieving the symptoms of epilepsy: Acupuncture, Ayurveda, Biofeedback Training, Bodywork, Chiropractic, Craniosacral Therapy, Detoxification Therapy, Environmental Medicine, Holistic Dentistry, Hypnotherapy, Magnetic Field Therapy, Meditation, Mind/Body Medicine, Naturopathic Medicine, Osteopathy, Reflexology, Traditional Chinese Medicine, and Yoga\\n\\nBest of health to you\\n\\nCheers\n\nAnswer:",

Don't panic. Unless you have a valid reason to think it's a miscarriage. Go to a gyno if thati s the case. But miscarriages that happen in the first few months of preganancy pass unnoticed. And your age. God, ppl have babies in their late 40s so it's not menopause. But seriously, just ask your mom. Those things sort of run in the family.\n\nAnswer:",

Would you share your per hour pay? Is 7-10 dollars per hour about the range? Thanks!\nAnswer: I LOVE my job. It did take a couple of years to get the hang of classroom management. \\n\\nWhen I first started teacher preschool (12 years ago), I made $7 per hour. A lot of schools pay you depending on your education or how many child development units you have. If you have 6-12 units, $10 is not too bad. \\n\\nI now have my Masters in Education (60+ units in child development) and make $20 and hour. This is considered good pay in my area (California). Most schools here pay about $12 per hour. The teacher turnover rate is pretty high partially because of this. If you are educated, go for as much as you can get. Enjoy!\n\nAnswer:",

This was done as an extremist act, not the written word of the Bible.  Slavery is not forbidden in the Bible, however, maltreatment of slaves was condemned in the Bible.  But, Slavery is a social issue, not a spiritual issue, so the decision is up to the government.\n\nAnswer:",

My daughter has biblical beleifs towards evolution and this boy just wasnt buying it. But he was opened to what she had to say. Everything she shared with him, he had an opposite response to. he kept asking her to \"please convince me. i want to believe\"  So my daughter came to me for advice, and im at a loss.\nAnswer: I will have to support Evolution! Let me give you a definition of Evolution!\\nBiological evolution, simply put, is descent with modification. This definition encompasses small-scale evolution (changes in gene frequency in a population from one generation to the next) and large-scale evolution (the descent of different species from a common ancestor over many generations).\\nDocumentation of ancestor-descendant relationships among organisms also comes from the fields of biogeography, taxonomy, anatomy, embryology and, most recently, genetics \u2014 particularly DNA analysis.\\nThe fossil record remains first and foremost among the databases that document changes in past life on Earth. Fossils provide the dimension of time to the study of life. Some of the most basic observations about fossils and the rock record were made long before Darwin formulated his theory of \u201cdescent with modification.\u201d The fossil record clearly shows changes in life through almost any sequence of sedimentary rock layers. Successive rock layers contain different groups or assemblages of fossil species.\\n{We have now more than enough fossils to determine for sure that humans didn\u2019t appear on this planet in the genetic form they are today!\\nWE HAVE MORE THAN ENOUGH EVIDENCE THAT THERE WAS AT LEAST ANOTHER SPECIES WHICH LIVED WITH US!! And I am talking about Neanderthal man who was not our ancestor but a different Human than us!!! (Did God experiment with human species?) We even have proof that at a certain point in time 3 human species shared the planet! (Homo sapiens, Homo Erectus, Homo Neanderthals)}\\nOf course I want comment the stupid argument why all the apes didn\u2019t evolve to humans. Ok I will comment!!\\n(We share a recent common ancestor with chimpanzees and gorillas; we have many anatomical, genetic, biochemical, and even behavioral similarities with these African great apes. We are less similar to the Asian apes--orangutans and gibbons--and even less similar to monkeys, because we share common ancestors with these groups in the more distant past. \\n! By the way why God decided to create 5 different species of primates and 280 different species of monkeys?)\\nAs a conclusion Evolution is not a theory but a proven fact (In scientific terms, \"theory\" does not mean \"guess\" or \"hunch\" as it does in everyday usage. Scientific theories are explanations of natural phenomena built up logically from testable observations and hypotheses. Biological evolution is the best scientific explanation we have for the enormous range of observations about the living world.) Creation is a Hebrew Myth and unfortunately is not a fact but a myth!!!!\n\nAnswer:",

This request is ususally followed up by a \"no-trespass\" order from the police that officially advises the individual that they are not wanted on the premises.

And allow me to elucidate.\\n\\n1)  It's the world's oldest profession for a reason.  Trying to stamp out prostitution is like trying to drain a river with a straw.\\n\\n2)  It's a consensual act.  The buyer and the seller are both willing participants.  I'm not saying that it's healthy, but those who sell their bodies aren't being stopped anyway.  And healthy profits can fund the therapy needed to get out of that business' mindset... in theory.  Or it can buy a lot of drugs... which is another legalization topic to hold...\\n\\n3)  Legalization can lead to regulation: required doctor visits for health certification, like the \"A, B, C\" system in California restaurants.  With legal prostitutes to visit, there may be a decrease in \"blind hookups\" at your local bar, where a lot of disease gets spread around for free... well, for the price of a few drinks.\n\nAnswer:",

Chemicals in food stimulate sensory neurons in the taste buds, which communicate with the brain via one of three cranial nerves: the facial nerve (VII), the glossopharyngeal nerve (IX), or the vagus nerve (X).  These nerves enter the central nervous system at the level of the brainstem, synapsing with secondary neurons in the solitary nucleus.  The signals then pass upwards through the thalamus to the gustatory cortex, which is part of the primary somatosensory cortex located on the surface of the parietal lobes.  Note that the functioning of this pathway depends heavily on normal functioning of the sense of smell.  This is why your food tastes bland when you have a bad cold with a stuffy nose.\n\nAnswer:",

I was invited to play and was wondering how much padding to wear.\nAnswer: It depends on the person and how cold it is outside and how fast the guns is shooting. I usually wear jeans and a long sleeve shirt mostly with a t-shirt underneath. Sometimes i will double up long sleeve shirts or wear long underwear underneath one if it is really cold. The only way i get more padding is to wear long underwear legs. I don't recommend especially the first time going with just a t-shirt and bear arms, you will bruise and have welts all over. Make sure to conserve ammo and shoot at the effective range. Later on you can look into better face masks and neck protection, I don't know about cleats, I play in the desert/woods and so I wear boots. They do make a chest pad thing that is hard plastic which protects you and makes the balls break better. But you might be called a sissy. Don't wear too much padding as the balls will not break. Then they will all get mad at you and call you a sissy. Have Fun and don't take off your mask utnil the match is over and guns are on safe!!!!\n\nAnswer:",

So how did it reach earth surface?\nAnswer: Tectonic movements (earthquakes), volcanic action, and erosion.  \\n\\n1. Tectonic movements -- As the various plates that make up the Earth's surface move around, some crash into each other and one is forced up over the other.  Thus, for example, Himalayas.  The rocks that were deep underground are forced up near the surface.\\n\\n2. Volcanoes spew out lava which forms igneous rocks, but certain kinds of explosions will toss out large chunks of metamorphic rock from deep underground as well.\\n\\n3.  Erosion is primarily responsible for most of what we see as the surface of the Earth. While the other two actions will bring the rock near the surface, the action of wind and water removes the top layers of dirt and lighter rock.  Most significant is the action of glaciers, which strip everything down to the bare rock -- this is, I believe, why you find granite near the surface in New Hampshire.\n\nAnswer:",

You waste away in prison for ten years before finally being exonerated by DNA evidence, only to discover when you get out that everyone you ever cared about has disappeared because they didn't want anything to do with you, and you can't even hold a job anymore because of the time you spent in prison. Now, say you run into that same prosicutor on the street one day. Would you maintain the moral high ground and walk the other way, or would you seek justice for what was done to you?\nAnswer: Walk the other way unless you want to go back to prison.

They also share all the other characteristics of birds, being warm-blooded (around 40 deg C) and having a reduced reproductive system (one functional ovary or testis).\\nLike all other birds, penguins have feathers. Penguin feathers are short, overlapping and densely packed. The outer part of the feather is waterproof while the inner down section traps an insulating layer of air, keeping the penguin warm in the sometimes freezing water. Unlike those of flying birds, the feathers on a penguin wing are very short.\n\nAnswer:",

(Cut from the link below): \"Grapes are rich in anthocyanins, flavones, geraniol, linalol, nerol and tannins. Experts believe these compounds protect against cancer. In addition, red grapes contain resveratrol which is believed to help reduce cholesterol and protect the heart. Grapes also contain some potassium. Grapes are also beneficial for cleansing and detoxing the system.\" It also notes one cup of grapes equal 114 calories. It is healthy...\\n\\nBut I also know too much of anything is bad for you...a whole bag of grapes and a whole bag of potato chips certainly have differences, but regardless. As long as eating a lot of grapes isn't a part of your daily lifestyle, I see no wrong in it. The important thing is to eat a variety of foods that give you a variety of nutrition.\n\nAnswer:",

I send my daughter to a private Christian school. Some people think it's too expensive to send their kids to Christian school, but I tell you it doesn't cost any more than daycare. Most of you probably send your kids to daycare, don't you? Also, you can't put a price on a good Christian education.  They have smaller teacher:student ratios, they focus on academics, they learn good morals, they are allowed to worship as they please (in accordance with the 1st Amendment), they score higher than the national average on tests, and they help to create productive members of society. They are not crime-and-drug ridden like so many public schools. \\nA public school would be the last place I'd send my child if I could help it.\\nIf, however, I did have to send here there, I would be on those teachers, principal and school board like white on rice. I would give them notes saying that they are not to teach my children evolution or any sex education (especially presented by Planned Parenthood!) or any \"diversity\" training (which is really just pro-gay propaganda). I will NOT have my child brainwashed by the public school system. You should be aware that the creation of a free, public school system was one of the tenets of Karl Marx's Humanist Manifesto, which was implemented by Teddy Roosevelt in this country. In fact, most of the tenets of that Manifesto were accomplished in this country in the first half of the 20th century. We have slowly become a socialist nation.\\nBefore that time, children were either home-schooled or private-schooled - and some of the best, most intelligent people our country has ever produced were educated thusly.\n\nAnswer:",

How are they similar?\nQuestion: I need some Biology help! Can some one explain how allopatric speciation differs from sympatric speciation, and give examples of each? And how are the concepts of gradualism and punctuated equilibrium different, and how are they similar?\\n\\nThanks for the help! Biology has proven to be a little out of my realm of comprehension.\nAnswer: The difference betwen allopatric and sympatric is easy to remember: allopatric is geographical, sympatric is non-geographical.  \\n\\nAllopatric speciation involves a geographical separation (like a river, a mountain, a drought, separation following a migration, etc.)  Two subpopulations of a species get isolated from each other and evolve separately.  If this isolation is long enough, the two subspecies will first lose the desire, and then the ability to interbreed ... hence speciation.   This is believed to be the most common form of speciation in animals.\\n\\nSympatric speciation involves no geographical barrier, the two subspecies share territory.  One way that could happen is if there are two niches (like two types of food) in the same territory .... if some members prefer (or are slightly better adapted) for one food and others prefer the other food, then each will tend to meet and mate more with others of the same preference.  Thus any difference in adaptation between the two subspecies will get amplified, and the two may show less desire, and eventually an inability, to interbreed.  This is considered very rare in the animal kingdom except for insects, but may be more common in plants.  An example commonly given is the apple maggot (a kind of fly).\\n\\n(See source 1 for a better description.)\\n\\nPunctuated equilibrium is a theory developed by Niles Elderedge and my favorite science writer, Stephen Jay Gould.  It is the view that species often go through long periods of relative stability (equilibrium) that is broken up (punctuated) by periods of relatively fast change.  (See source 2 for a great illustration of how it works.)\\n\\nContrast this with gradualism, which holds that evolutionary change happens at a steady pace. \\n\\nThey are similar in that they both hold that evolution is a slow process ... in fact, it is a common misconception that they are opposites, when in fact punctuated equilibrium is a form of gradualism because it still holds that evolution is a long gradual process.  (See source 3)\\n\\nIn other words the opposite of gradualism is not punctuated equilibrium, it is something called 'catastrophism', where change occurs as a result of short-lived violent events (catastrophes).  Few scientists today are catastrophists. \\n\\nFeel free to email me if any of this is unclear.\n\nAnswer:",

The next day he showed up at my door show me the \"blotched haircut\". I did not open the door and I told him to\"count me out as a friend. :\" He said he would do that and did not need me. It has been one month now and I sent and apology letter to him to-day. I asked for forgiveness. What should I expect now?? A phone call from him???

Both very disturbing, and I saw myself in both dreams. I heard that if you see yourself in a dream it is supposed to mean someting different then when you dont see yourself. I also dream every single night and wake up and remember them. I have had dreams since i was 7. Nothing as creepy as the ones where i saw myself in them. I am a beliver that dreams mean something, so does any one know what the differnce is if you see yourself in dream, rather then just having the dream????\nAnswer: I have no idea what it means but i see myself in many of mine.  Maybe it is a way of your mind giving you a real look at yourself, maybe you subconsiously think there is a flaw everyone sees.  I dont know.  Good Luck figuring it out though.  lol\n\nAnswer:",

Autism is classified as a Pervasive Developmental Disorder (PDD), which is part of a broad spectrum of developmental disorders affecting young children and adults--the Autistic Spectrum Disorders (ASD). The range of these disorders varies from severely impaired individuals with autism to other individuals who have abnormalities of social interaction but normal intelligence--Asperger's syndrome. The ways in which autism is exhibited can differ greatly. Additionally, autism can be found in association with other disorders such as mental retardation and certain medical conditions. The degree of autism can range from mild to severe. Mildly affected individuals may appear very close to normal. Severely afflicted individuals may be extremely retarded and unable to function in almost any setting.\\n\\nIn the past, autism has been confused with childhood schizophrenia or childhood psychosis. As additional research information about autism becomes available, the scope and definition of the condition continues to become more refined. Much of the past confusion about the disorder has been resolved.\n\nAnswer:",

I only had 10 pounds that I wanted to take off. I have tried everything on the market.  Yea, I hate exercising and have had a lot of success in the past w/ products like the original Diet Fuel and T-Burn - both w/ ephedra.  So when they took ephedra off the market, I started trying everything under the sun.  I bought Hoodia online and tried it for 2 straight weeks; it was like taking a sugar pill.  I had absolutely no beneficial side affects from it at all - No increased energy, No suppressed appetite, and No increased metabolism.  I was actually more dehydrated when I was taking it which is just the opposite of what it claims.\\n\\nDon't waste your money - I started walking everyday for 40 mins and now I'm 15 lbs thinner! =)\n\nAnswer:",

The only stuff i know is Greek, and that isnt much. So if  you could tell me everything you know about WHATEVER kind of Mythology, i would appriciate it alot. I cant go to anywhere but yahoo, so please dont give me references. Thank you!\\n\\n\\nI would like as many people as possible to answer this question, no matter if someone else already answered something that you know about as well. There are many different versions!\nAnswer: Here is what I found on Egyptian mythology\\nGods\\nEarly beliefs can be split into 5 distinct localized groups,\\n\\nthe Ennead of Heliopolis, whose chief god was Atum \\nthe Ogdoad of Hermopolis, where the chief god was Ra \\nthe Chnum-Satet-Anuket triad of Elephantine, where the chief god was Chnum \\nthe Amun-Mut-Chons triad of Thebes, where the chief god was Amun \\nthe Ptah-Sekhmet-Nefertem triad of Memphis, unusual in that the gods were unconnected before the triad was formalized, where the chief god was Ptah \\nThroughout the vast and complex history of Egypt, the dominant beliefs of the ancient Egyptians merged and mutated as leaders of different groups gained power. This process continued even after the end of the Egyptian civilization as we know it today. As an example, during the New Kingdom Ra and Amun became Amun-Ra. This \"merging\" into a single god is typically referred to as syncretism. Syncretism should be distinguished from mere groupings, also referred to as \"families\" such as Amun, Mut and Khonsu, where no \"merging\" takes place. Over time, deities took part in multiple syncretic relationships, for instance, the combination of Ra and Horus into Ra-Herakty. However, even when taking part in such a syncretic relationship, the original deities did not become completely \"absorbed\" into the combined deity, although the individuality of the one was often greatly weakened. Also, these syncretic relationships sometimes involved more than just two deities, for instance, Ptah, Seker and Osiris, becoming Ptah-Seker-Osiris. The goddesses followed a similar pattern. Also important to keep in mind is that sometimes the attributes of one deity got closely associated with another, without any \"formal\" syncretism taking place. For instance, the loose association of Hathor with Isis.\\n\\nAn interesting aspect of ancient Egyptian religion is that deities sometimes played different conflicting roles. As an example, the lioness Sekhmet being sent out by Ra to devour the humans for having rebelled against him, but later on becoming a fierce protectress of the kingdom, life in general and the sick. Even more complex is the roles of Set. Judging the mythology of Set from a modern perspective, especially the mythology surrounding Set's relationship with Osiris, it is easy to cast Set as the arch villain and source of evil. This is wrong, however, as Set was earlier playing the role of destroyer of Apep, in the service of Ra on his barge, and thus serving to uphold Ma'at (Truth, Justice and Harmony).\\n\\nGiven the diverse tapestry of religious history in ancient Egypt, it comes as no surprise that many different forms of theism evolved. Although mainly henotheistic in nature, at some point even monotheism, as introduced by Akhenaten thrived. What is important to realize is that it is very dangerous to try and cast the religion of the ancient Egyptians in any particular theistic form. Even more dangerous to claim is that, towards the end of the Egyptian civilization, a drive toward monotheism was taking place. The evidence of the time (Greaco-Roman period) seems counter to this belief: although syncretism was still taking place (sometimes and more frequently between Egyptian and non-Egyptian deities), many deities were still revered and served. As an example the following which Thoth enjoyed during these later periods. This is quite evident when one simply looks at the vast number of mummified Ibis birds offered to him. Also, the belief in Egyptian deities were spreading to countries other than Egypt. For instance the Roman belief in, and following of Isis.\\n\\nThe Egyptians believed that in the beginning, the universe was filled with the dark waters of chaos. The first god, Re-Atum, appeared from the water as the land of Egypt appears every year out of the flood waters of the Nile. Re-Atum spat and out of the spittle came out the gods Shu (air) and Tefnut (moisture). The world was created\n\nAnswer:",

My mother hates them, but she never seems to acknowledge the fact that I have never been in a fight, even when someone hits me.  That has started to change, but only to a self-defence point, and because I had problems with self-esteem.  There is no direct correlation between violent video games and violence in real life.  If you're smart enough to know the difference, they are harmless.  I think children younger than at least 14 shouldn't have access to them, but when I think of the politicians who are using this as political tool to ban them, it is infuriating.  Even if you look at Columbine and the other school shootings, there are so many factors that contributed to wackiness that you can't just single out the fact that they played Doom!  They were abused or neglected, and teased at school.  I was teased too, but I dealt with it better.  Do you know how many guys out there play Doom?  And just how many of them have shot anyone?  It depends on your definition of \"minors\", but banning them completely until you're eighteen is really stupid.\n\nAnswer:",

I was my face every morning and ever night and I wear lancome and clinique makeup that is makeup fee I don't know what to do all around my chin is breaking out. Any sugjestions?\nAnswer: Hi BabyDoll\\n\\nHere are some real answers on skin conditions. Remedies at the bottom. \\n\\nCleansing the body of toxins is the key. Especially a colon cleanse! Educate yourself on detoxifying the blood.\\n\\nJudyth Reichenberg-Ullman N.D. - \"What is your skin trying to tell you? Often the skin is a metaphor for deeper issues and a way for your body to send up a red flag to warn you that all is not well underneath. When our skin is unhealthy it is usually a reflection of the internal state of our bodies, and is often a sign of poor elimination of toxins and waste products. Most of us are embarrassed by skin problems such as rashes, boils or acne, especially in places where others can see our imperfections. The skin is the body's first line of defense against the environment. It has to deal with the effects of weather, sun , cold, heat, dryness, humidity, scrapes, bumps, soaps, detergents, chemicals, perspiration and dirt of all kinds. It is a wonder that our skin stays healthy most of the time! We can help our skin deal with this onslaught by optimizing our general health and by protecting our skin from harsh environmental exposure. Western medicine generally treats skin eruptions with either antibiotics, cortisone, or antifungal preparations. These medicines may alleviate the skin problem temporarily, or occasionally for good, but do not address the source of the problem. Putting a lid on skin symptoms without getting to the root of the imbalance may even result in suppression, that means the imbalance may be driven deeper causing more serious health problems later without ever strengthening the underlying vital force of the person. Fortunately, naturopathic medicine offers a wide vareity of effective treatments for skin problems.\"\\n\\nJudyth Reichenberg-Ullman N.D. - \"Your skin is a reflection of how well your body is eliminating the toxins that build up on a daily basis. Chronic skin conditions such as acne, eczema and psoriasis stem from a combination of genetic factors, immune stress, dietary deficiencies or sensitivities, and the accumulation of toxins in the body. For our skin to be radiant and clear, it is very important that the other organs of elimination (kidneys, liver, lungs, and colon) are cleansing the body effectively. If not, the skin will be overtaxed, pores will become clogged, and eruptions of one sort or another will result. Here are a number of steps you can take to improve your body's overall elimination wtih specific emphasis on your skin.\" \\n\\nDetoxification is a normal body process of eliminating or neutralizing toxins through the colon, liver, kidneys, lungs, lymph and skin. Fasting is the world's most ancient and natural healing mechanism. Fasting triggers a truly wondrous cleansing process that reaches right down to each and every cell and tissue in the body. \\n\\nLearn more about Therapeutic Fasting and Detoxification - Internal Cleansing \\n\\nNatural Cures\\n\\n1. Fruits and Vegetables for Acne: Carrot & spinach, celery & watercress, grapefruit juices are all useful to combat acne. \\n\\n2. Unwholesome Foods: Acne, a prevalent problem among teen-aged boys would not be possible in our society if our foods were wholesome. A most sad and disgusting sight is the pus-filled pimples due to inner toxicity --- wastes trying desperately to escape through the face. This condition often turns a gentle face in the blossom of youth into a waste dump of pimples, pus and subsequent pock marks which can be prevented. The tons of acne medications and prescriptions sold annually act only on the effect of the harmful food, and not the cause of the disease, malnutrition. The traditional teenage meal, a grease burger, french fries and a milk shake or cola simply does not provide enough nourishment for anyone, let alone a boy going through puberty to adulthood. Our highly processed foods are devoid of hormones found in fresh fruits, vegetables, grains, nuts and seeds. **Must do a colon cleanse to \n\nAnswer:",

I really want to see if anyone is thinking the same answer as me, which could also be wrong....\nAnswer: Divergence leads to different developments in species, even those that share a common ancestor. We didn't come from apes as they are today. We came from an ape-like ancestor (primate) that we share with the apes of today, but there were divergent events at some points in history that lead to the developments of homosapiens and the other various primates of today.\n\nAnswer:",

Different locations.  You can operate on the same frequencies if the transmitters are located far enough away from each other.  Look how many \"Channel 3\" TV stations there are.  They're far enough away from each other so they don't interfere.\\n\\n3.  Different modulation.  FM and AM are types of modulation.  In the case of radio, they're also on different spectrums, but you could have the same frequency modulated differently and have minimal interference.\\n\\n4.  Digital transmission.  You can transmit information digitally over the airwaves and \"multiplex\" it such that it doesn't interfere with other transmissions (cell phones for example).\n\nAnswer:",

When you join these activities you will keep yourself occupied even if you don't make new friends, but meeting people that enjoy the same things as you do will no doubt end up in new friendships. :)\n\nAnswer:",

Since then our finances have changed and we cannot make our monthly commitment to repayment. What can this company do other than place a lien againt our property? I figured we could go in at tax time each year and pay them $5000.00, then we could pay it all off in just over 3 yrs instead of the 15 year term we had anyway. Can this work, because we cannot afford the repayment amount anymore.\nAnswer: DEPENDING ON THE AMOUNT OF THE HOME EQUITY LINE THEY COULD FORCLOSE ON YOUR HOME.  YOU USED YOUR HOME FOR SECURITY ON THE LOAN AND NOW THEY OWN A PORTION OF IT.\\n\\nI WOULD SUGGEST GOING TO THE BANK AND TALKING TO THE LOAN OFFICER AND SEEING IF YOU CAN MAKE JUST THE INTEREST PAYMENTS UNTIL TAX TIME EACH YEAR.

Scoliosis can also begin in a fetus during fetal development. Congenital scoliosis is a type of birth defect that affects the development of the vertebrae and often occurs with other congenital problems.\\n\\nScoliosis runs in families and may involve genetic (hereditary) factors. But researchers haven't identified the gene or genes that may cause scoliosis. Doctors also recognize that spinal cord and brainstem abnormalities play a role in some cases of scoliosis.\\n\\nScoliosis isn't caused by poor posture, diet, exercise, or the use of backpacks.\n\nAnswer:",

Golf instructors are typically under-qualified  in my opinion.  There are merely a handful that really worth their salt.  One acid test I use is whether the instructor has a grasp that golf cannot be explictly \"taught\"... the learning, for any player, comes thru self-discovery and experience.  The instructor's role is to convey WHAT needs to happen in a cause/effect fashion, but there are numerous ways to \"implement\" a given what. And more over, the verbage rarely translates into \"feel\".  You can't explain \"feel\"... but rather guide a student to constructively acquire feel thru guidance.  Finally, I feel instruction RARELY touches on the mental aspect of both playing and learning.  What constitutes good practice??  How to play under pressure...  My list of rants goes on and on... so YES, I think an objective reviewing source would be fantastic.  Other comments?\n\nAnswer:",

But you want to follow through on your shots, at first just hitting it may seem like a good idea, but eventally you will suck.

However, at the end of the lease/contract he could raise the rent as he saw fit and it would be up to you to accept or decline.

So if you covered its eyes would it still be able to navigate perfectly around obstacles and hunt as efficiently?\nAnswer: bats still use their eyes to see!! They use echolocation to find the precise location of prey...but they use eyes as well.  It may be albe to know where a bug is by the echolocation and then fly to that spot to get it...but would still need to see with it's eyes to grab it.  Bats are not constantly sending out signals...they use their eyes to see the rest of the time.  They send out the signals when they want to feed.

Assess the current diet and identify where improvements should be made and commit to those improvements. \\nreduce toxin intake - obviously tobacco, alcohol especially - they might seem to provide temporary relief but they are working against the balance of the body and contributing to stress susceptibility, and therefore increasing stress itself. \\ntake more exercise - generally, and at times when feeling very stressed - exercise burns up adrenaline and produces helpful chemicals and positive feelings. \\nstressed people must try to be detached, step back, look from the outside at the issues that cause the stress. \\ndon't try to control things that are uncontrollable - instead adjust response, adapt. \\nshare worries - talk to someone else - off-load, loneliness is a big ally of stress, so sharing the burden is essential. \\nincrease self-awareness of personal moods and feelings - anticipate and take steps to avoid stress build-up before it becomes more serious. \\nexplore and use relaxation methods - they do work if given a chance - yoga, meditation, self-hypnosis, massage, a breath of fresh air, anything that works and can be done in the particular situation.\n\nAnswer:",

Who start it. Is there any relationship with Judism\nAnswer: Prophet Mohammad wrote the Quran, the foundation of Islam. Muslim means \"one who submits\" and Islam means \"submission\". These are references to submitting to God and His will. It is related to the Jewish faith in that Muslims believe that there has forever been only one faith. It just gets regular updates from Allah when needed. So ... God sent Prophet Moses. Latter God sent Prophet Jesus. Then God sent Prophet Mohammad. In Islam this represents a steady, unbroken stream of faith. And for what its worth ... Arabic and Aramaic are closely related languages. Aramaic would have been the everyday language Jesus used. The word for God is the same in both. Its Allah.\n\nAnswer:",

I consider it a valid form of \"blue sky\" thinking and use it when I'm committed to some project and no ideas or motivation are coming.

Part of the reason behind it is that it's more short acting than most sleep aides and you're not suppose to wake up with that groggy, hung over sensation you get with many others.

Then there is Greenland melting, and well in 100 years or so New Orleans will be under water.  The only possible way to save New Orleans is to trash everything and then build up the dirt so it isn't below sea level.  That way you've got a nice little Island, and while it can be done, who wants to pay for it? You? By the way, it will be a for the rich sorta place.\nAnswer: I agree with bd, we help other countries more than we help our own and these people need our help. I understand your point but look at the monies our government wastes on less important issues. This one my friend is the best way I have seen in a long time to spend money, and if we don't rebuild New Orleans, what state is next? in a 100 years who knows what the earth will look like but I am all for preserving what we have and rebuilding when tragedy strikes.\n\nAnswer:",

Or how much it usually is for another gym.  Thanks\nAnswer: I'm a member for fitness first too, depend which country you in. In Australia, it cost about $40 a month for student and you can only go to one particular fitness first. If you pay $80 a month (adult) you can go to any fitness first gym. \\n\\nBut you should negotiate heavily, because they will pressure you into signing up. Alot of people got the price down to $60 a month instead of $80. A trick, at the end pretend you don't want to join, they ask why, just said it cost too much then they will reduce the price for you because they don't want to lose customer.\n\nAnswer:",

Interestingly enough, this about coincides with the cycle of the moon and there are animals which only mate during a full moon.  Although not proved, it is possible that somewhere in our evolutionary past, we had an ancestor who found that mating during a full moon improved its chances of survival.  Another theory is that the 28-day cycle prevents multiple pregnancies (i.e., multiple fertile eggs in the uterus) with multiple ages--something that could be harmful to the woman's and fetus's health.\n\nAnswer:",

But with our science and medical knowledge we correct those problems and that person goes on to reproduce offspring and pass those defective genes to the next generation. \\n\\nIt wouldn't be long before they phrase \"Your kid looks just like you\" will no longer be said.

The sole argument used in its support is to cease thinking about any subject which is not immediately understood.\\n\\n\"That feature of life looks hard to evolve, therefore, Unnamed Intelligent Designer did it.\"\\n\\nI like to look at how history would be different if the great scientists of the past had used such logic.\\n\\nIsaac Newton:  \"Gravity pulls things down, but the moon stays up.  How strange.  Must be God.\"  (Nobody works out the laws of physical motion.)\\n\\nEdward Jenner:  \"I wonder why milkmaids get smallpox less seriously than other people... Oh, I guess God did it.\"  (Nobody invents vaccines.)\\n\\nIntelligent Design \"theory\" is the death of science.  It is lazy thinking.  It is simply accepting any unknown as an unknown and finding nothing in it worth investigating further.  It is the most fundamentally anti-science idea possible.\\n\\nThink my examples of overstated?  Consider the real life guru of the ID movement, Michael Behe.  He testified in court that nobody could figure out the evolution of the immune system.  When he was presented with dozens and dozens of articles working out the evolution of the immune system, he admitted having read none of them, but had no compunction about just declaring it \"wasn't enough\".  How much would be?  Here is a person who has stopped thinking.  He's supposed be a biochemist, but he has no interest in expanding biochemistry.  He found a gap and declared that God filled it and his thoughts stopped there.  Many, many other scientists, unencumbered by the albatross of ID continued to investigate and have expanded our knowledge of the immune system extensively, just so Behe can sit back smugly and declare whatever progress they've made cannot possibly be enough.\\n\\nI repeat, ID is the death of science.  ID is the most fundamentally anti-science idea possible.\\n\\nID \"theory\" is best stated, \"It is absolutely undeniable that someone, somewhere, at some point, did some thing, using some methods, to create life.\"  That's not a theory.  That hardly qualifies as an idea!  But they can't fill in any of the vapidity.  If they fill in any of the unknowns, it becomes obvious they're trying to force their religion onto the masses.  Therefore, they're stuck with a vague framework of an idea.\\n\\nIf they could fill in bits, they might stumble into a theory that was testable.  If we replace \"someone\" with \"My great grandmother\", suddenly, we have an idea we can test.  A false idea, but still a testable one.  My great grandmother has identifiable properties.  We know how much biochemistry she knew.  We can judge the likelihood of her having done such a thing.  That likelihood is, of course, so close to zero there's little point in calculating it.\\n\\nIf we fill in the \"how\" gap with \"using a screwdriver\", then again, we can test it.\\n\\nBut ID theory refuses to fill in the gaps.  It claims to not be interested in who.  It claims to not be interested in where, when, how or what.  Dembski says it's a theory of \"design detection\".  But, again, how do we test it?\\n\\nDembski's filter resolves to two states:  Yes, it was designed!  We don't know.\\n\\nSo, can this be falsified?  Can we send something designed through and have the filter produce a false negative?  No, because the filter has no negative state.  It doesn't say \"designed/not designed\", it says \"designed/don't know\".  There is no way to test for a false negative.\\n\\nCan we test for a false positive?  Nope.  Since God is on the table here (and they refuse utterly to let natural laws have sway like real science does), everything in the universe supposedly could be designed.  So there is nothing that you can definitively say isn't designed to run through the filter.\n\nAnswer:",

The word \"capacitance\" has as its root the word \"capacity\" -- capacitance is the capacity an object has to hold electrons. The lamp, when standing by itself on a table, has a certain capacitance. This means that if a circuit tried to charge the lamp with electrons, it would take a certain number to \"fill it.\" When you touch the lamp, your body adds to its capacity. It takes more electrons to fill you and the lamp, and the circuit detects that difference. It is even possible to buy little plug-in boxes that can turn any lamp into a touch-sensitive lamp. They work on the same principle.\n\nAnswer:",

If yes, a secretary is basically a scribe and keeper of records of an organization. He/she makes the necessary paperworks for the higher officer's approval such as letters, proposals, etc. In an office, the task is pretty much the same in general, but an office secretary is more clerical in function which includes transcribing and writing the letters of the boss, filing, answering the fones, scheduling the boss's time, do other stuff the boss requires, etc.\\n\\nThe treasurer is the keeper of financial accounts. Most of the time, the treasurer holds the purse of an org. But he/she is the most likely person accountable for the wrongful disbursement of money. The treasurer should know how to monitor where the money goes so that s/he can regularly report the org's financial status. s/he should keep receipts or evidences of where the money is being used.\\n\\nIn some organizations, to prevent misuse of funds, bank accounts are co-signed by other officers besides the treasurer. So both signatories are the most accountable for embezzlement in unfortunate cases.\\n\\nP.S. In check the organization's bylaws and guidelines because some orgs have additional tasks for each positions, e.g. secretary sometimes dual-tasks as media officer, etc.\n\nAnswer:",

But most real-world reactions aren't like that.  The reaction rate tends to slow down as product is created.  If one used just the right amounts of reactants to produce the theoretically possible amount of product, one might wait a very long time, or forever: many reactions just reach an equilibrium, and never go to completion.  So, you use a large excess of one of the reactants, which causes all, or almost all, of the other reactant to be converted.\n\nAnswer:",

All of these radicals have both natural and anthropogenic (manmade) sources. At the present time, most of the OH and NO in the stratosphere is of natural origin, but human activity has dramatically increased the chlorine and bromine. These elements are found in certain stable compounds, especially chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), which may find their way to the stratosphere and there be liberated by the action of ultraviolet light. Most importantly, the chlorine atoms so generated destroy ozone molecules in a catalytic cycle. In this cycle, a chlorine atom reacts with an ozone molecule, taking an oxygen atom with it (forming ClO) and leaving a normal oxygen molecule. A free oxygen atom then takes away the oxygen from the ClO, and the final result is an oxygen molecule and a chlorine atom, which then reinitiates the cycle. A single chlorine atom would keep on destroying ozone forever were it not for reactions that remove them from this cycle by forming reservoir species such as hydrochloric acid and chlorine nitrate. On a per atom basis, bromine is even more efficient than chlorine at destroying ozone, but there is much less bromine in the atmosphere at present. As a result, both chlorine and bromine contribute significantly to the overall ozone depletion.\\n\\nPolar stratospheric clouds\\nThe reactivation of atomic chlorine from these reservoir species is normally slow, but is enhanced by the presence of polar stratospheric clouds which appear during Antarctic winters, leading to a strong seasonal cycle in ozone hole formation.\\n\\nFor more info go to http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ozone_depletion\n\nAnswer:",

The others use shared read locks (which \\nwill lead to deadlocks and blocking).  We never block on a read -- they \\nfrequently block on a read.

It tastes a lot like white rice, but it has more nutrients.\\nhttp://www.foodsubs.com/Rice.html#converted\\nConverted rice: Converted rice has been soaked and steamed under pressure before milling, which forces some of the nutrients into the remaining portion of the grain so that they are not completely lost in the processing. Enriched parboiled rice is similar to regular enriched rice in terms of thiamin, niacin, and iron, but it has more potassium, folate (folic acid), riboflavin, and phosphorous, though not as much as brown rice. Converted rice takes a little longer to cook than regular rice, but the grains will be very fluffy and separate after they have been cooked. \\nhttp://www.wholehealthmd.com/refshelf/foods_view/1,1523,75,00.html\n\nAnswer:",

Thoughts... suggestions?\nAnswer: Let us know what the closest main city is for help.  I find local computer places are much better than the big box stores.  Especially price-wise.  Look in your yellow pages for a store that services computers and sells re-furbished ones.  They're the ones that will use the parts they have on hand instead of trying to sell you special order stuff, or a whole new computer for that matter.\n\nAnswer:",

It uses a rotary \"piston\" instead of the common up-and-down strokes of a standard i.c. engine.  Altho it was first used in an NSU RO-80 [I think that's the correct model number], it was Mazda that brought the Wankel engine into the public consciousness via a sedan as well as the early RX-series of sports car; I believe the rotary-engined Mazdas first appeared in the early- to mid-seventies\n\nAnswer:",

You should go to the dentist to make sure they are growing in the right direction and they may be able to prescribe something to ease the pain too, or make a small incision to help them push through the gum (it sounds horrible I know).\n\nAnswer:",

Would you want revenge?  What if the government behind the military force that carried out the bombing classified your family's extermination as 'collateral damage'?  They were aiming at the strategic military target next to your house, but missed by just a little bit.  Would you hold that government in favor?  Would you wish you could strike a blow against it?\nAnswer: I would hate to even think about it. But revenge is the answer. Isn't that the first reason Afghanistan, then Iraq were invaded to revenge 9/11. It's human nature, only there has been no concrete proof approved by the UN to prove they were responsible - only media coverage that had the effect of mass brain washing and that has confessed that Iraq had nothing to with 9/11 or had WMD.\\n\\nIraqi and other people are being punished and labeled as terrorists simply because they are defending their country; a country that was invaded for no reason, lately being bringing them democracy! Democracy on the other hand would not accept that people are jailed, sent off to be tortured for years without a trial then maybe finally released without being convicted of anything.\\n\\nThese people (Iraqis etc.) have nothing to defend themselves with against heavy military weapons, napalm bombs bombarding on them and their loved ones, destroying their homes and the infrastructure of their country and yet they fight back, they are terrorists!\\n\\nOther nations, can shoot children and women on the beach because they have a \"right to defend themselves\" while other nations are being fought on their own soil by invaders and they do not have this same right.

Try and be fair and don't fix it to make your driver in it.\nAnswer: I don't like the chase the way it is.  It's just a matter of time before some one who does not have a win in the first 26 races and is in tenth in points but out 500 plus points puts together 10 trouble free races and wins the championship.  Since I am stuck watching a nasty system I don't like.  I think I would change it 1) must win to qualify 2) must be within 300 points of first 3) more points for winning 4) some points for pole 5) laps lead bonus must be under green flag.  I thought about someone's comment about defending champ should get a free pass and although I like the idea of being able to defend the title, I think not.  That would be like the Superbowl champion or the World Series winner getting a free pass to the playoffs.  Sometime, teams don't deserve a shot.

I would even die for him. Except he loves another girl. And it's breaking my heart. My friend asks him what he thinks of me and he thinks i'm OKAY. What should i do?!\nAnswer: Leave him be. You can't make somebody love you, especially if they love somebody else. No matter how hard it is or how much it hurts, let him go. Nobody ever wants to hear that, but trying to force it or taking desperate measures (NOT saying you would do that) always leads to a bad ending. If anything, just be a good and sincere friend.

The light energy is absorbed by chlorophyl and ultimately transferred to ADP to create ATP in a series of chemical reactions. This process is very indirect. It involves the transfer of an electron to the activated chlorophyll molecules that induces the flow of electrons and H+ across the thylakoid membrane. A chemiosmotic potential is generated by the flow of electrons and H+ providing energy to drive the formation of ATP from ADP.\n\nAnswer:",

The solvent keeps the glue from sticking inside the bottle.\\n\\nWhen you squirt the glue out of the bottle onto a piece of paper or a broken china cup, the solvent gradually evaporates, allowing the glue to get sticky.\\n\\nThe solvent molecules bounce and jiggle at the surface of the glue-solvent mixture and some get enough energy (when neighbors slam into them) to escape. That's evaporation. Outside of the bottle, few solvent molecules remain near the spread glue to hit it and renter the mixture. So, gradually enough solvent molecules leave the mixture that the glue gets sticky.\\n\\nIt's different in the capped bottle. The solvent molecules evaporate inside the bottle-just as they do outside the bottle when you spread the glue. However, once airborne they don't have far to go. They're trapped in the bottle. Some of the solvent molecules near the surface of the glue bop into and reenter the glue. That's condensation. Gradually--as more and more solvent molecules crowd into the airspace above the glue-solvent mixture--more and more solvent molecules reenter the mixture. Until, eventually, as many solvent molecules leave as reenter and the mixture reaches equilibrium.\\n\\nGlue manufacturers make sure the glue mixture stays runny by choosing a sufficiently small air space when they fill the bottle. You may have noticed that old glue in an almost empty bottle gets viscous or even solid. It's a good idea to buy only enough glue for use in the near future.\\n\\nAs far as sticking to the bottle is concerned, here's the poop from Elmer's glue: \"If it were to dry out or harden, it would form a very weak bond with the special nonporous plastic used to make the bottle and could be de-bonded or removed easily,\" says Robert Thompson.\n\nAnswer:",

The Racial Justice Act (\"RJA\") was signed into law by Kentucky Governor Patton on May 1, 1998.  This allows a capital defendant to use statistical evidence to show that race influenced the decision to seek the death penalty in her or his case. \\nThe statistical evidence that the capital defendant may use consists of evidence that a death sentence was sought significantly more frequently against persons of one race or sought more frequently against defendants whose victims were of one race. The decision will be made in each defendant's trial court at a pretrial hearing and the defendant has the burden of proof by clear and convincing evidence.\\n\\nFYI:  This Kentucky bill was initiated after an investigation found that all of the state's death row inmates were there for killing whites and none for killing blacks. While the U.S. House of Representatives twice has passed bills similar to the RJA, they were defeated in the Senate. The passage of the RJA in Kentucky, however, is a hopeful sign that Congress and other states may follow Kentucky's example.\n\nAnswer:",

Preferably, that means about 7 a.m. or earlier. You might not feel like it but Get Up. Such regularity helps your body function more normally so you're more likely to feel normal. \\n\\nLIGHTS: \\n\\nLight helps your body function better. So turn on a lot of lights as soon as you arise. Open curtains to get more sunlight. Better yet, go outdoors into the sunshine as soon as you can. Remove any eyewear so light will enter more readily (glass cuts out some of the sun's rays). But don't stare at the sun, of course. \\n\\nMOVE: \\n\\nBe active right away -- oxygenate! That means getting up and walking around your dwelling for five or 10 minutes, or perhaps riding an exercycle. Mild exercise gets the blood flowing and transports more oxygen throughout your body (especially to your brain), helping you feel mentally alert and alive. \\n\\nMUSIC: \\n\\nSelect and play some energetic, happy music as you dress and have your breakfast. The audiovisual department of most libraries has albums and tapes you can check out. \\n  \\n\\nBREAKFAST: \\n\\nBegin your breakfast with protein (i.e., meat, eggs, peanut butter, nuts, cheese). When you get up, your body chemistry is ready to convert food, especially protein,into longlasting energy. To balance your most important meal of the day, add an orange or other fresh fruit and whole grain cereal or whole grain bread. \\n\\nTALK WITH SOMEONE: \\n\\nOne of the quickest ways to beat the blues is to interact with others. You might not feel like doing that - you'd rather avoid people when blue. So make lt easier on yourself. Talk with someone you enjoy about a subject you enjoy so there is definite give and take. \\n\\nAnd, force yourself to say \"hello\" to the persons next to you in class, those where you live, anyone around. \\n\\nLIMIT CAFFEINE: \\n\\nThe long-term (four hours or so) effects of caffeine are depression. Try to limit coffee to no more than one cup in the morning. Coffee can make you more alert for an hour or so, but later you get an opposite reaction. Caffeine tends to increase the release of insulin in the blood, and insulin lowers the blood sugar level. When you have low blood sugar levels, you begin to feel less sure of yourself, and have low energy levels, which can lead to the blues or depression. \\n\\nLIMIT SUGAR: \\n\\nSugar might give you an initial rush of energy, but within an hour or so the blood sugar level can become low, and when it's low you may feel low, too. \\n\\nThe caffeine/sugar cycle. It's easy to get caught in the caffeine and sugar cycle -- having coffee, caffeinated soft drinks, or something with sugar every two hours or so to \"stay up.\" For example, cola contains about 10 teaspoons of sugar plus caffeine equal to about half a cup of coffee. In addition to bringing on the blues, this cycle can result in dependence, poor nutrition. and obesity -- reasons to get down on yourself even more and feel blue. \\n\\nMAINTAIN FIBER: \\n\\nFiber helps food go through your digestive system at a proper rate, giving a more constant energy supply. Highly processed foods merely provide a quick surge of energy which can be followed by depression. You can maintain fiber in your diet by eating an orange or grapefruit rather than just drinking the juice. Eat fresh vegetables, fresh fruits, and whole grain breads and cereals. \\n\\nSTRESS B COMPLEX: \\n\\nSome persons report receiving help by taking a concentrated vitamin B complex. You'll find these called something like \"Stress B\" or \"B 50.\" This is controversial. \\nSome nutritionists say, \"Yes, this really should be considered,\" and others say, \"No, this is not a good Idea.\" You can try some and decide whether or not it helps you. If it does help, then perhaps you should consult a nutritionist to see if there are other ways you can augment your die\n\nAnswer:",

Last time I check, I am paying more for things, so my guess is that inflation is still going up, not down.\nAnswer: I-bonds are an unusual beast. There are actually two rates that apply to the bonds. The interest rate and the inflation rate. The rate the government reports is the interest rate. The inflation rate is added to the value of the bond as is the interest rate. \\n\\nOf course the inflation rate is the rate calculated by the Bureaus of Labor Statistics.

Three cars and a truck had hit each other on the slick over pass of a bridge and all the traffic was at a stop. We were close enough that I could take out my camera and take a photo of the scene. Yes, I know. How morbid but I did it anyway. When I had the film developed the picture had this white, misty thing above on of the cars that had what appeared to be wispy wings moving off the photo edge. I didn\u2019t even know what it was until my friend grabbed my arm and told me that I had a photo of a guardian angel. I was amazed and ever since I\u2019m sure angels exist.\n\nAnswer:",

The more information the better.. The more traditions names will be helpful.\nAnswer: The native \"Maoris\" has a greeting which is quite special. Instead of a handshake they would touch noses with the person they are greeting then slowly but firmly place there hand in the other persons genitals, they would expect you to do the same. When both yours and the Maoris hand are places on each others genitals you would move in closer to each other and your mouths will touch, you kiss and soon the Maoris tongue would enter your mouth, like a french kiss, but much more aggressive. This greeting would carry on about 5 mins until the Maori reaches an orgasm. Hope this helps :)\n\nAnswer:",

I was afraid of having too much work and getting bad grades. I really wish I can drop out of school, but didn't because I was afraid of what my parents would say. I always felt that my friends and classmates were smarter than me. At weekends, I was so happy. By Sunday night, I feared of going to school and having too much work during the weekends. At home I never want to talk about school. I would not talk to that family member or relative too much from then on that talks to me about schoolwork.\\nDuring summer, I wish the schoolyear would start.

Getting my books and folders together a week before class, and being ready then. I found I was feeling apprehensive *then*, and by the time class began, I had moved past that and was ready to study. Also, I would get up in time for my, say, 8 a.m. classes a week ahead of time. I built up the routine, and as I said, got all the anxiety out ahead of time.\n\nAnswer:",

There isn't any rash or visable  irritnt\nQuestion: She started having an itch a couple weeks ago on her lower torso and now she itches all over her torso and it seems to be spreading to her upper thighs and arms.\nAnswer: Could be a number of things. Many viruses can cause this type of reaction but most likely its an allergic reaction to something in her environment.  Have your recently purchased a new type of laundry detergent, body wash, or any other product that might come in contact with the skin? if so you could try switching and see if this helps.  Has your wife bought any clothing lately and worn them without washing them first? Many people are sensitive to the dies and other chemicals that might be on new unlaundered garments especially blue jeans.  Look at what you have consumed within the last week and see if their is anything out of the routine that she has eaten.  all in all I would suggest having your family doctor check it out especially if she is pregnant or expecting.\n\nAnswer:",

Or some people just have them removed for the hell of it?\nAnswer: Generally speaking, tonsils are taken out for recurrent infection (tonsillitis, \"strep throat\" etc) or if they are so large that they are obstructing the upper airway or causing problems eating.   They are a small part of a person's immune system.  They do not serve to prevent infections from going into the lungs.  There is a significant amount of \"tonsil\" tissue that is left in place on the back portion of the tongue when tonsils are removed.  Studies done looking at the impact on the immune system agree that patients without their tonsils (and adenoid) are no more likely to catch an illness than patients with tonsils.\n\nAnswer:",

How bout a square mile and explode means that the water justs bursts right out. Well, electricity isn't really matter, it's a current. So any electricity you put into the lake would leave immediately. Thus, you would have to put a tremendous amount of power all at once. Frankly, I don't think you could do it, because we can't even produce as much electricity as is in a lightning bolt in one second. A lightning strike would only affect one small section of the lake.

In my experience (operating theatres) we 'debride' dead tissue from wound sites. For example somebody with diabetes who has lost circulation to the foot may have to have 'dead tissue' surgically removed to stop the onset of gangrene. \\n\\nIf you're talking about hard skin and that's the reason for the removal of that skin then try this site:\\n\\nhttp://www.feetforlife.org\n\nAnswer:",

This doesn't make a lot of sense. For 1600 years the Catholic Church was the only Christian group, they wrote most of Christian doctrine and Christian holy texts including the New Testament. Why all the hostility?\\n\\nI mean no offense, I am just curious.\nAnswer: it all started with the protestant reformation brought about by martin luther.  you can read more details by typing in protestant reformation or martin luther into a search engine.  the catholic church took exception and thus the protestants somewhat broke off from the \"non-catholic christians\".  also, the christians do not acknowledge the apocrypha or \"between the testaments\" writing that the catholics do as holy scriptures as part of the canon used in worship.\n\nAnswer:",

They each applied to just one school and were accepted ED. THat was that. My third kid just didnt know what he wanted to do in college. He was a great student and had lots of choices. So he didnt apply ED anywhere, he applied to nine schools and got accepted by eight. But by the time the acceptance came he had thought about things more and was ready to make a decision. It was still tough but he felt better about it than if he had to decide in October. \\n\\nI think that most of the schools should keep the ED. The elite schools may drop it to give a better shot to kids who are not so well counseled, but for most schools it is a help to the students.\n\nAnswer:",

The problem is that many people don't go to the doctor for regular check ups.  In the case of AIDS is caused by a virus. The scientific community knows little about viruses, and the HIV virus is constantly mutating, making it difficult to find something that would stop it.  They might find something that works for a certain strain of a virus but soon that strain will mutate, so the it won't work.

Talking about how young girls do the drug to lose weight.\nAnswer: As with most other habit-forming drugs, frequent use of cocaine causes the user to focus mainly on the high received from that drug, and other needs take a lower priority (sometimes much lower).  In this case, a cocaine user might be more concerned with the high from the cocaine that he or she uses it to \"replace\" most of his or her food intake.  Even basic personal hygiene, such as bathing and brushing one's teeth, might be lower on their list of priorities because in their minds: \"They gotta have that high!\"\\n\\nAs with other things in life, misinformation can really prove detrimental.

I don't know where to find him.\nAnswer: Please don't be misled by the previous responder. You are correct in asking your question. Most likely, unless you have been served by court documents you are probably still married. There is an off chance that your husband found an attorney that circumvented the service of process laws and your husband could still have been granted a divorce where ever he is without you knowing. There is no easy way to find out, but a good divorce attorney or PI may be able to, especially if a divorce has been granted somewhere. If you want to be divorced, your best bet is to initiate divorce proceedings yourself. Your attorney can serve your husband by publication if he cannot be located and you will be granted a divorce.\n\nAnswer:",

Think about it.\nAnswer: This is a difficult concept for many Christian groups who are not guided by revelation from God.  As is evident from the previous three answers--they don't know.  No mortal can understand what happens within the spiritual realm unless God Himself reveals it.  When men try to understand or explain spiritual matters without God's divine guidance we get answers like the ridiculous Athenasian, Apostolic or Nicean Creeds that gymnastically struggle to explain what God is like (not very successfully.)  However when God Himself parts the heavens and reveals truth to the earth through a living prophet the answers are much clearer.  Through modern revelation we know that those who inherit the highest kingdom of heaven will be living in the family unit, just as God the Father does.  We will not play harps, nor will we just sit around on clouds and sing, we will not lose our bodies and become incorporal mists of nothingness, we will literally become like God, our heavenly father with a glorified and tangible body of flesh and bones--just like Jesus had after His resurrection.  Where was there EVER a child that could not become like his parent with hard work and obedience?  This is the real joy of God the Father--to see his children become as he is.  That is what heaven will be like.  As to the details of how this will take place, the Lord in his wisdom has chosen not to reveal the particulars of the afterlife, but the promises are sure.\n\nAnswer:",

I called to inquire about the fine and found out it was about $700.00. I didn't have the money at the time so I did nothing. In Nov. 2005 I called again the fine was $715.00 I had the money but I had family problems so I had to use the money elsewhere. I inquired again in Feb. 2006 after I received my income tax and the fine increased to $1350.00 and i was told if it wasn't paid in 30 days the warrant stands and not to call again. I want to resolve this and get my license back but i feel this is unfair. Is there something I can do or can anyone tell me  when the ticket will no longer be valid? Or is there anyone who can help with this thank you,\\n Bill\nAnswer: you could probably go to court talk to a judge and work out some sort of payment plan and get it paid off in a year.\n\nAnswer:",

There is no way possible to determine the average IQ of either group. It is a moving target there are always people switching between parties. There is probably no measurable difference.\\n\\nAs for an earlier comment about graduate students being liberals. That may be true for liberal arts students, but engineering, sciences, and business majors are by and large conservative. Also once people graduate and are out in the real world for a few years they tend to become conservative. My wife and I both have post graduate degrees and so do our sons.

Unadulterated means pure, so the two girls have a pure hate for each other. This means that it wasn't influence by their parents, peers, or surroundings. The hate developed after the girls met. There is no other emotions with it; just complete and utter hatred. If you aren't speaking of \"Wicked!,\" this should still help you!\\n\\nI'll be checking back to see if you need more help!\n\nAnswer:",

Life may refer to the ongoing process of which living things are a part; the period between the birth (or a point at which the entity can be considered to be living) and death of an organism; the condition of an entity that has been born (or reached the point in its existence at which it can be established to be alive) and has yet to die; and that which makes a living thing alive.\n\nAnswer:",

It's probably an insect bite, fleas, crabs, saber toothed crotch crickets or something like that. Wash it with a mild bleach and water solution, then put an ice pack on it for 10-15 minutes. That should get rid of the swelling and redness. Then you need to treat it with an insecticide. I suggest RAID ant and roach spray.

A much more effective way to boost worker productivity is to link the work to morale and their self-image.  When workers are proud to work for a company, they will work harder, even without pay increases, because their work is tied in with their self-worth.\\n\\nThe opposite is also true.  If workers do not like their work environment and do not relate it to their self-worth, they will have poor productivity, even if pay increases are given to them.\\n\\nHere is a link to an academic paper on the subject.\n\nAnswer:",

In China or Taiwan, if it's unclear whether you are allowed to do something or not, the assumption is, you are NOT allowed. In the US, the rule is, you are allowed to do anything, UNLESS there is a law against it.\\n\\nAnother result of legalism is that in China and Taiwan, the government typically makes almost everything against the law, then doesn't enforce it all.  This means that they can allow a lot of technically illegal behavior, often with  appropriate bribes, but they can always crack down and start enforcing the law as it's written if the wind changes.\n\nAnswer:",

I agree with you that it is a virus causing the problem. Some viruses have the ability to change the registry and some have the ability to affect programs in your computer. It could also be a spyware or a hi-jacker. As far as i can remember, i just erased my harddrive completely and reinstalled the factory installed software back. Another problem i encountered was when my desktop computer started to run really slow and i just can't fix it with my anti-virus and anti-spyware software, so what i did was buy a new harddrive (fastest and with more memory) and threw the old one out.\n\nAnswer:",

The world wants to know.\nAnswer: I have been a cashier in a supermarket, a clothing store, and at a coffee shop. By far the most evil of customers tends to be at the supermarkets. \\nI will say that people tend to be impatient (especially here in the Northeast), and they do not understand the problems that can occur while making a transaction. However, since cashiering tends to be minimum wage, the quality of employees are hires are worthless, and sometimes they deserve to get yelled at.\\nI recently starting working at a coffee shop again, and a customer yelled at one of my co-workers, stating for her to \"hurry the fuck up, I'm late for work\". Like it was our fault for her being late.\n\nAnswer:",

If it is you yourself then find friends of a positive attitude to keep you mind off the thing that dpresses you and try to look on life with a positive attitude.

You will need to contact the state that holds your court order child support and get a copy of all transactions and payments from you. On this report it will show exactly what you are in arrears or if you have a 0 balance at the time the report is printed. Most states are now centralized and usually Child support will have a 1-800 number to call. Make sure that you have your social security number or case number handy when you make your call. Most child enforcement agencies will need that information before they can even talk to you. Good luck to you.\n\nAnswer:",

Please read for details! Could they be cancerous?\nQuestion: They seem to have appeared overnight, are evenly raised, slightly bumpy, and are unevenly colored (ranging from deep brown to lighter freckle-colored). \\nThey are 4.5 cm apart, and the first of the two is larger in size (approximately  4 cm in height and 2 cm in width) and the comparatively smaller of the two is approximately 1.25 cm in height and 1.5 cm in width.  \\nThey are located approximately 4 cm below the bottom of his left shoulder blade.\\nA history of cancer runs on both his maternal and paternal sides of his family, esp. skin cancer (his father, amoung others). He is very fair, but has limited sun exposure. (If only I could convince him to wear sunscreen everyday, and not only when he goes outdoors.... : ) ).\\nI am sorry to be so long winded, but I am sick with concern.\nAnswer: It's really hard to 'diagnose' from a computer - so try this - and also skin cancer isn't always caused by sun expsoure.  :)  Have him see a dr or a dermatologist to rule it out and put your minds at ease though.  :)  I know very fair skinned folks have to be checked at least once a year (personal experience), so it'll be good for him to go.  But here are some good guidelines.\\n\\nThe ABCs of melanoma\\n\\nA is for \"asymmetry\" - When you're looking at moles, you want to tell your doctor or dermatologist about moles that are asymmetric, or unevenly shaped and not the same size on all sides. \\n\\nB is for \"border irregularity\" - suspicious moles have an irregular shape or fade into the background. \\n\\nC is for \"color\" - check for moles that are more than one color. An even dark brown is considered normal. But moles that have multiple colors in them or black, red, white or pink moles are more worrisome. \\n\\nD is for \"diameter\" - Moles greater than six millimeters, which is about the size of a pencil eraser, should be examined. \\n\\nE is for \"evolving\" - Some experts are now adding a letter to the ABCs, which is an E for \"evolving.\" Any changes you notice over time in a mole or a skin lesion with respect to size, color and shape should be evaluated promptly by your dermatologist. If a mole is changing color or shape or it's smaller than a pencil eraser diameter and getting bigger, it should be examined by a dermatologist. Other changes in moles like inflammation, pain, crusting or bleeding should also be examined, but not all changes in moles mean it's malignant melanoma.\n\nAnswer:",

Help!!?\nQuestion: It says due to excessive activity on drive scan cannot be completed.\nAnswer: The reason it works in safe mode is because when in safe mode, your computer is running only the most necessary files; it disables viruses, spy-ware and a lot of other programs and files which work when running your computer normally.\\nIf your computer is running with an excessive amount of your hard drive, try shutting down all unnecessary programs first, so that program has access to all the memory it can possibly get.  You  might want to run anti-virus and ad-ware programs to see if that gives your hard drive more room.  If you have to, run everything while in safe mode to see if that will fix the problem.  I don't know what running system you use (Windows, for instance), so I can't tell you much more than this, but I hope it helps.\n\nAnswer:",

We have entered a dull season (the time between Labor Day and Back To School) and our instant credit performance is slipping, even though we have offered a high-ticket item as incentive. Does anyone have any successful ideas for employee motivation, pitch ideas or anything that can help raise our numbers back to goal?\nAnswer: You never want to give away gifts in exchange for a credit sign-up - as a rule of thumb, financial programs are poorly sold when a financial incentive is provided up front.  Your target audience are individuals who desire to make a purchase but may be hesitating due to lack of funds and credit.  So go to the highest priced items in your store, and have signs that say, \"$100 for this TV, but if you sign up for a credit card today, you only pay $12 per month in payments\" etc.  Market the card next to your highest price gifts to drive adoption of the credit program.  In fact, have credit apps next to these areas, so they don't forget to sign up on the back to the front of the store.\n\nAnswer:",

Do non-drinkers live in regular?\nQuestion: I'm a high school senior filling out my college forms and trying to decide between regular and sub-free housing. I don't plan on getting wasted every weekend, and don't want my room to be a party place. I also don't want a roommate who comes home and vomits everywhere. However, I also want to meet a lot of new people, and don't want to limit myself to one group. Any advice?\nAnswer: From my experience, \"substance-free\" refers to alcohol and smoking.  There is no smoking allowed within a certain distance of the front of the building and no alcohol allowed.  Regular dorms are less strict though I doubt smoking would be allowed inside anywhere and drinking is definitely restricted to 21 and over.  There is probably a mix of students within both types though the substance free is probably more students that refrain from substances.  Really, this would be a personal preference and my substance free dorm was where most of the athletes lived though I saw plenty of substances discretely.  I'd suggest calling the school and finding out the difference.  Don't worry about not meeting people in either type of dorm.  You'll be blown away by the vast variety of people you will run across.\n\nAnswer:",

Something in the water?\nAnswer: The more they hear about the Holy Word of God, the love of Jesus and the cleansing atoning blood available for their sins, the more their spirits are stirred up! It's not personal really! Satan has always hated truth but hopefully someone may be won to Christ when they have tried all this world has to offer and find no fulfilment, they may remember the truth and turn to Him! Thanks for giving me an easy question!\n\nAnswer:",

I don't know Louisiana law, but I've never heard of a state putting something like that into law.  Instead, it is a common courtesy that employers and employees typically offer two weeks notice before terminating.  If you want to maintain a good relationship with your employer, or want a good reference from them later, it's advisable to give two-weeks notice, but I'd be shocked to hear that it is required.\n\nAnswer:",

Give them some degree of freedom, while not letting them take over.\\n\\n* Read a book such as FIRES IN THE BATHROOM by Kathleen Cushman or TOOLS FOR TEACHING by Fred Jones.

What other mammal has this characteristic?\nAnswer: In contrast to most mammals, humans do not have an all-embracing intense hair on their body. Several theories have been advanced to explain the bareness of human body hair. One suggests that nature selected humans for shorter and thinner body hair as part of a set of adaptations including bipedal locomotion and an upright posture. There are several problems with this savanna theory, not least of which is that cursorial hunting is used by (other) animals that do not show any thinning of hair, and that hair similar to chimpanzees and gorillas also shades the skin from radiant heat and protects it from hot winds, and thus another mechanism for heat loss is not required. Another problem is that bipedal locomotion apparently now predates hominids moving from a forest environment to a savanna environment. A more recent theory for human hair loss has to do with a possible period of bipedal wading in a salt marsh in the Danakil region of Ethiopia, possibly occurring in the hominid lineage between 5 and 7 million years ago. As a wading animal, it was more efficient to develop short body hair and a layer of subcutaneous fat for streamlining and insulation in the aquatic environment; the eccrine sweat glands developed later after the hominids left the water; see Aquatic ape hypothesis. One problem with this theory is that both chimpanzees and gorillas have the same density and distribution of the eccrine glands, but that they have not been developed for sweat production.\\n\\nA third theory for the thin body hair on humans proposes that Fisherian runaway sexual selection played a role here (as well as in the selection of long head hair). Possibly this occurred in conjunction with neoteny, with the more juvenile appearing females being selected by males as more desirable; see types of hair and vellus hair. The human female body hair typically has more vellus hair (making the skin appear bare), while the male body typically has more terminal hair (especially on the chest, abdomen and back). Thus sexual selection can explain the sexual dimorphism in human body hair, with the results of selection being more evident (more extreme) in the female than in the male, a point which the other two theories cannot address without proposing substantially different behavior between males and females. Also, we see that artificially bare (shaved, etc.) legs, arms, etc. on women are seen as \"sexy\" even today, while body shaving is not nearly as common for men.\n\nAnswer:",

The company pays taxes on profits and subsequently distributes a dividend out of their after-tax profits. Shareholders must then pay tax on the dividend received.\\n\\nThe tax imputations indicate to the government that the company issuing the dividend has already paid a portion of the tax due. The shareholder is able to reduce the tax paid on the dividend by the amount of the tax imputation credits.\n\nAnswer:",

Both detect nothing wrong with my PC. Why does Windows File Protection keep asking for my Windows XP setup CD?\nAnswer: I run all the same programs. First log onto Windows up date and make sure you have ALL of the available updates for XP(especially the security ones,you may be surprised if there are a lot).You may have to disable Adware to do this. Then make sure you are running Nortons fire wall and not the Windows default firewall(this is usually done automatically upon Norton set-up). Make sure you run live update on Norton Program every day that you log on to the internet. Do not trust Any Auto up-date programs! Run A full virus scan manually now and no less than once per week. Then see about reloading your set-up program. If this does not work, Try resetting your computer to the very first day you installed XP and repeat the above procedures. Somewhere, something in your setup program has been removed. If you continue to have this problem, E-mail Microsoft's Help Desk. GOOD LUCK!\n\nAnswer:",

How are the views different on political issues?\nAnswer: Basics:\\n\\nDemocrats want to put the burden on the Federal Government. \\n\\nRepublicans want to put the burden on the individual states.\\n\\nReality: Either way, the burden gets placed on us. \\n\\nI tend to vote republican; but, am disgusted by both parties lies. \\nDemocrats have taken credit for what republicans have done.\\nRepublicans have lied about making changes. Anyone remember that \"Contract with America\"? Where'd that go? \\nDemocrats tend to be more liberal in human rights.\\nRepublicans tend to be more conservative. \\nBoth parties are hypocritical on moral issues. Clinton signed into law a bill that allows censorship. Mr. Morality himself. Hmmm.\\nThe Republicans have Foley, who help enact the toughest sex crimes law against pedophiles.

The body of virtually all children produces an enzyme called lactase.  When they grow up, the body switches off the production of that enzyme.\\n\\nDue to a genetic mutation that occurred on chromosome 2 in the population of European humans, virtually everyone of European ancestry can tolerate lactose well into adulthood.  Africans descended from some tribes mostly can - while Africans descended from other tribes mostly cannot.\\n\\nThis is completely with respect to genetic ancestry, not where someone lives or is a citizen, of course.\\n\\nQuite a bit more information on this biological phenomenon is available in the Wikipedia.  I have included a link to a page that explains lactose intolerance in detail.\n\nAnswer:",

Think about a room filled with people.  If the people move around quickly (as molecules in heated air), then the people will spread out more and make more room between eachother (which would be lower density).  Since the hot air is less dense, and more dense objects are \"more affected\" by gravity, then the warm air is \"lighter\".\n\nAnswer:",

In other words, wind travels counterclockwise around low pressure zones in the Northern Hemisphere. It is approximately true in the higher latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere, and is reversed in the Southern Hemisphere, but the angle between barometric gradient and wind is not a right angle in low latitudes. See Coriolis effect#Flow around a low-pressure area.\"\\n...does Buys-Ballot's law have anything to do with why toilets flush counterclockwise in the northern hemisphere and clockwise in the southern hemisphere?

Given the molecular weight of methane (CH4) is 16, we have one mole of methane on our hands.\\n\\nNow, find the equation for the reaction.  This is:\\n\\nCH4 + O2 -->  CO2 + 2 H2O\\n\\nIf we assume complete combustion of the CH4 (given excess oxygen), then we have one mole of carbon dioxide and 2 moles of water on our hands.\\n\\nFinally, convert that back to weight using the molecular weight of carbon dioxide (44) and water (18) and you get\\n\\n44 + 2 (18) = 80 grams of total products.\n\nAnswer:",

The result was a tempurature increase.  A drought could also be caused becasue a of a decrese in transpiration (process of trees giving off water from their leaves).

Put blood at the other end.  Once the leech finds the blood it'll remember the route.  Take that leech, put it in a blender and liquidise it, then feed it to another leech.  It will get the route right first time, give two leeches the leech soup and put them in identical but different mazes and they will both get it right first time.  Aparently it's a thing called chemical memory.  Have you got any amazingly amazing facts?\nAnswer: It's not a fact.  First of all, the claims about chemical memory apply to planarian flatworms, NOT leaches.  Second of all, only one scientist claimed to have produced those effects.  Nobody else has been able to duplicate those experiments, hence they're regarded as false.\\n\\nIt doesn't really matter where you got it from, it's still false.  I've heard professional scientists report it as well.  So what?  Professional scientists are not inerrant.  This story got widespread publicity in the seventies and like all stories that hit the media, the retraction hardly got any attention at all.\\n\\nKeep in mind, when I say the experiment couldn't be duplicated, I mean FROM THE GROUND UP.  You cannot even train a flatworm to solve a maze in the first place, much less pass on this non-existant training to another flatworm through flatworm-flesh.\n\nAnswer:",

Many other people think it's \"redneck.\"  While I am in no way a redneck (and don't cheer myself), I think it's sweet and recognize the good intentions behind it.  It's become such an issue that local principals have hired police officers to escort people out who make too much noise.  I'm wondering if this is a southern thing, or if it happens in the north too.\nAnswer: Our graduations were getting so crazy that they threatened to revoke graduation certificates if anyone got out of line. There were kids ripping off their gowns and walking across the stage in their Gothic underwear. Some flashed the audience, one threw a frisby from under his gown. Yes, it was really crazy, and loud. There are horns going off, beach balls, balloons, etc. I say, let them have some fun! They will never graduate from high school again!\n\nAnswer:",

There is a bed of honeycomb catalyst in the exhaust. The catalyst is typically Platinum. The unburned hydrocarbons (gasoline) coming from the engine flows into the catalyst where the exhaust temperature is high enough to react with the catalyst and (flame-less) oxidation takes place.  The hydrocarbons oxidize to carbon dioxide and water and nitrogen oxides\n\nAnswer:",

No, I  had not run much before those two days and not stretched before.  I also have been experimenting with orthodics in my shoes ever since hoping that might cure the problem but could it have made it worse? I want to continue to exercise, actually my muscles hurt less when I keep moving, how should I proceed?\nAnswer: Hi! I'm a certified personal trainer with 10 years experience. I am wondering if you'd been running prior to this? Did you just decide to take up running then do 2 days in a row? Running is a high impact sport. It is best alternated with lower-impact activiities. Whether you were running before or not, it is better to run every OTHER day and let your muscles get some recovery time. Muscles don't get stronger with exercise, they get stronger AFTER exercise, during the recovery period. Rest is essential to muscle growth and fitness advancement. Doing light workouts on the days between allows more blood flow to the overworked muscles and speeds up recovery time. Taking 1000 IU's of vitamin E has also been shown to reduce muscle soreness by repairing muscle oxidation on a cellular level. Running 3 days per week is excellent for cardio fitness, but every day of the week ABOVE 3, increased your chance of injury by 100%.  I would recommend talking with a trainer who has a certification from ACE, NASM, ACSM or NSCA. Those are the 4 best certifications out there. There are more than 200 others that are just paper. Let them design you a program. Some trainers will even do some muscle tests on you to find out if you have muscle imbalances or problems. The orthodics might be hurting you, not helping. Please seek professional advice. It could save you some serious injury for a very small price.\n\nAnswer:",

Animal life exhibits will all of time.  I have horses.  Sometimes they do not want to come in from the pasture.  It is fascinating to observe just how willful they really are.  Animals, though, vary in their thought processes depending on the species and their individual instincts that God gave them.  \\n\\nAlthough animals are living souls, they do not have individual moral responsibility to God.  It is the spirit of God's intelligent creation (angelic beings and mankind) that sets them apart from the animal kingdom.\n\nAnswer:",

I know most will say \"Just go to school and stop being lazy, or take an accelerated class.\" Please don't bother being redundant.

I've met some pretty stupid college grads and people with HS diplomas who are brilliant, but held back because they don't have that piece of paper.  \\nI don't think there is such a thing. I could be very wrong.  But there would be difficulty proving your abilities.  They would have to develop a standardized test for every occupation.  And some employers may not find the instituion or degree to be reputable.  They want to hire someone who slept in 4 years worth of classes.\n\nAnswer:",

They will only last you about a year, but then you shouldn't suck at golf, and you'll want some high quality clubs.

Sweating and burning calories reduces weight.  Even though your muscles swell from being overworked, they still have the same weight, if not the same mass.  But afterwards, if you are looking to gain weight, I suggest eating 1.5 times your body weight (just substitute lbs. for g.) of protein shortly after you workout.  Ex: You weigh 150 lbs.  150 x 1.5 = 225lbs.  You need to intake around 225g of protein to successfully gain weight that isn't fat, but the agents that aid in lean muscle mass.\n\nAnswer:",

It drives me crazy when my boss \"forgets\" that she already told me to do something.\nAnswer: That they always want to blame the staff for their decisions.  They expect us to remember stuff from three years ago without having to look it up, they will change how tings are done on a moment's notice, and will tell three differnt employees three different things on how they want something done.  They cut us off before we can tell them something then ask why they were never told.  They say there is \"no money\" for raises, then buy $50,000 vehicles for their salespeople, then blame the office staff that their profits are down.  They also sell products at lower than they pay for them and blame the staff for them showing a loss on it.\n\nAnswer:",

It was at that point that every physical property that mattered was at least as good in the white fillings.  HOWEVER - you must be meticulous when placing white fillings.  A poorly placed white filling will have new decay under it within a matter of weeks or months - not years.  If I can not get a good (dry) environment for placing a white filling, I sigh a little bit and go ahead and use a silver filling.\\n\\nAs far as asking how long tooth-colored fillings last, let me say this.  I have been putting white fillings in some back teeth for about 25 years, way before the material was really designed for this application.  Many of those fillings are still there, because I was very cautious about where I did them.  I'd say I was really on the bandwagon by about 1985-1990 and practically every while filling I've done (to my knowledge) is still serving.  That's \"only\" 15-20 years for the oldest ones, but I have only just begun to see some that need replacement because of wear and those that I am replacing are around 20 years old or more.\n\nAnswer:",

The Twilight Zone. Hoodoo Sea. The Devil's Triangle. The vast three-sided segment of the Atlantic Ocean bordered by Bermuda, Puerto Rico and Fort Lauderdale, Florida, did not receive its most famous nickname until 1964, but reports of bizarre happenings there, or nearby, have been recorded for centuries. In fact, many claim that Christopher Columbus bore witness to the Bermuda Triangle's weirdness.\\n\\nAs the Nina, the Pinta and the Santa Maria sailed through the area in 1492, it is reported that Columbus's compass went haywire and that he and his crew saw weird lights in the sky, but these events have mundane explanations. From the account in Columbus's journal, it is thought that his compass's slight inaccuracy stemmed from nothing more than the discrepancy between true north and magnetic north. As for the lights, Columbus wrote of seeing \"a great flame of fire\" that crashed into the ocean -- probably a meteor. He saw lights in the sky again on October 11, which, of course, was the day before his famous landing. The lights, brief flashes near the horizon, were spotted in the area where dry land turned out to be.\\n\\nAnother historical event retroactively attributed to the Bermuda Triangle is the discovery of the Mary Celeste. The vessel was found abandoned on the high seas in 1892, about 400 miles off its intended course from New York to Genoa. There was no sign of its crew of ten or what had happened to them. Since the lifeboat was also missing, it is quite possible that they abandoned the Mary Celeste during a storm that they wrongly guessed the ship could not weather. But what makes it even harder to call this a Bermuda Triangle mystery is that it the ship was nowhere near the Triangle -- it was found off the coast of Portugal.\\n\\nThe Bermuda Triangle legend really began in earnest on December 5, 1945, with the famed disappearance of Flight 19. Five Navy Avenger bombers mysteriously vanished while on a routine training mission, as did a rescue plane sent to search for them -- six aircraft and 27 men, gone without a trace. Or so the story goes.\\n\\nWhen all the facts are laid out, the tale of Flight 19 becomes far less puzzling. All of the crewmen of the five Avengers were inexperienced trainees, with the exception of their patrol leader, Lt. Charles Taylor. Taylor was perhaps not at the height of his abilities that day, as some reports indicate that he had a hangover and failed in his attempts to pass off this flight duty to someone else.\\n\\nWith the four rookie pilots entirely dependent on his guidance, Taylor found that his compass malfunctioned soon into the flight. Taylor chose to continue the run on dead reckoning, navigating by sighting landmarks below. Being familiar with the islands of the Florida Keys where he lived, Taylor had reason to feel confident in flying by sight. But visibility became poor due to a brewing storm, and he quickly became disoriented.\\n\\nFlight 19 was still in radio contact with the Fort Lauderdale air base, although the weather and a bad receiver in one of the Avengers made communication very spotty. They may have been guided safely home if Taylor had switched to an emergency frequency with less radio traffic, but he refused for fear they would be unable to reestablish contact under these conditions.\\n\\nTaylor ended up thinking they were over the Gulf of Mexico, and ordered the patrol east in search of land. But in reality, they had been heading up the Atlantic coastline, and Taylor was mistakenly leading his hapless trainees much further out to sea. Radio recordings indicate that some of them suggested to Taylor that Florida was actually to the west.\\n\\nA search party was dispatched, which included the Martin Mariner that many claim disappeared into the Bermuda Triangle along with Flight 19. While it is true that it never returned, the Mariner did not vanish; it blew up 23 secon\n\nAnswer:",

Can my landlord keep my deposit?\nQuestion: I moved into a 4 bedroom property in Hertfordshire, England under a 10 month contract. The contract was for one room, not the house. I had to leave the property after 3 months. However, I made a verbal agreement with my landlord that I could leave as long as I found someone to occupy the room and pay rent for the remainder of the contract. I did this and she signed a new contract AND paid another deposit. That was 5 months ago. Now he is having problems with the new tenant and says he will keep hers and my deposit if he doesn't get all the rent from her. I know this is unfair and I plan to take him to small claims court. BUT i'm worried in court he will say I ended the contract that I signed early. I think he will deny our verbal agreement. I paid all my 3 months rent. If he does do this, can i still get my deposit? I plan on writting him a letter threating court action.\nAnswer: I am not a solicitor, but my darling wife always says, \"A verbal contract isn't worth the paper it's printed on.\"\n\nAnswer:",

If you haven't done so, you can find the default IP address assigned to it in the manual. something like 198.0.0.1, then plug that IP in  the address bar in your browser and you will be prompted to enter the user name and password. which is by default usually user: admin password: administrator or vice versa. You can also check what your firewall IP is by going to the start menu, selecting run, and typing cmd then press enter. a dos window opens and you type ipconfig, then press enter, some info is returned the gateway IP is your firewall/router IP address. Once logged through the browser go to the advanced or security tab and make the necessary adjustments. for more step by step instructions I suggest visiting the manufacuter web site, consulting the manual, or googling something like \"setting up secure wireless network Linksys (or whatever)\"\n\nAnswer:",

This also works for other things, like a solution of water and alcohol.  Since alcohol has a lower boiling point (meaning that it has a higher vapor pressure at a given temperature than water), it will evaporate quicker than water when you heat the solution.\\n\\nWhen you lower the pressure above a liquid, the liquid boils at a lower temperature.  A liquid will boil when its vapor pressure eqauls the pressure above the liquid, so if you lower pressure, you lower its boiling point.\\nWhen you lower the pressure substancially (like with a vacuum) liquids will boil much easier (some even at room temperature), meaning that you do not have to heat them up quite as much in order to boil them.\n\nAnswer:",

Having promised to cease singing at 8:30 p.m., the marchers did so.

Chicago police, to prevent what they regarded as an impending civil disorder, demanded that the demonstrators, upon pain of arrest, disperse. When this command was not obeyed, petitioners were arrested for disorderly conduct. \\n\\nThe opinion of the Supreme Court of Illinois suggests that petitioners were convicted not for the manner in which they conducted their march but rather for their refusal to dispense when requested to do so by Chicago police.  However reasonable the police request may have been and however laudable the police motives, petitioners were charged and convicted for holding a demonstration, not for a refusal to obey a police officer.\n\nAnswer:",

In Oracle9i it's functionality has been extended to include binary reads/write operations. In this article I will demonstrate how to use the UTL_FILE package to perform a simple data extract to a CSV file.\\n\\nIn Oracle8i the UTL_FILE.FOPEN procedure accepted an actual path for the location parameter. Access to the directory was restricted by the UTL_FILE_DIR parameter in the init.ora file. This gave a reduced level of control and required the server to be bounced before changes could take affect. This situation has been improved in Oracle9i where the path has been replaced by a directory object which points to the path. This makes alteration of the path possible without alterations to the code. In addition access control is granted via priviledges which gives a greater degree of control.\n\nAnswer:",

I meditated for two months and felt warm now i have mental illness\nAnswer: Asian traditions recognize a number of pitfalls associated with intensive meditation practice, such as altered perceptions that can be frightening, and \"false enlightenment,\" associated with delightful or terrifying visions (Epstein, 1990). Epstein (1990) describes a \"specific mental disorder that the Tibetans call 'sokrlung' (a disorder of the 'life-bearing wind that supports the mind' that can arise as a consequence...of strain[ing] too tightly in an obsessive way to achieve moment-to-moment awareness\" (p. 27). When meditative practices are transplanted into Western contexts, the same problems can occur. Anxiety, dissociation, depersonalization, altered perceptions, agitation, and muscular tension have been observed in western meditation practitioners (Bogart, 1991; Walsh & Roche, 1979). Yet Walsh and Roche (1979) point out that \"such changes are not necessarily pathologic and may reflect in part a heightened sensitivity\" (p. 1086).\n\nAnswer:",

The thinness of air and difficulty breathing and tiring from physical exertion occurs around 5,000 feet or even 6,000 feet or higher. Now 2,000 meters, that would have an impact with altitude. However, I believe goats are much faster than chickens so the answer is no, a chicken cannot outrun a goat a 200 meters above sea level. I believe a goat would easily outdistance the chicken in a race without any problems whatsoever. No contest. A chicken only runs about 9 miles per hour. A goat is much faster.\\n\\nAlso, if you scroll down to the bottom of this second link you will see the speeds of various animals.\n\nAnswer:",

Please tell me we are not talking about the idea that safety is a major factor in the difference; having to use blunt-end scissors, no small parts they can swallow, and all that garbage.

This reputation came to public awareness in the 1950s and became a household name in the 1970s, mostly due to \"The Bermuda Triangle\", a bestselling book written by Charles Berlitz.\\n\\nVarious explanations for the apparent high number of dissapperances have been put forward, ranging from the mundane to the hyper-fantastic.\\n\\nSkeptics contend that this region has a comparable rate of maritime and aerial incidents as any other similar sized region of the ocean. They point out that Lloyd's of London, a world-reknowned insurer of maritime vessels, does not charge a higher insurance premium for ships that regularly traverse the triangle.\\n\\nScientific considerations for an increased dissaperance rate take into acount that this region experiences severe tropical storms and is the source of many hurricanes. These storms create an increased danger to both ship and air traffic.\\n\\nRougue waves have also been put forward as a possible cause. These rare waves can reach heights of as much as 100 feet (30 meters), easily swamping most ships. Rouge waves, however, would have no effect on air travel.\\n\\nA third scientific explanation is methane hydrates. Methane deposits on the ocean floor may release bursts of methane gas that reduces the density of the water it permeates. Since ships rely on displacement to stay afloat, a reduction of density in the water would cause a ship to immediately sink. As the methane leaves the water and rises into the air, it would reduce the density of the air as well, thus reducing lift on aircraft, causing them to descend rapidly. In addition, the methane would change the air mixture taken into the engines of the aircraft, causing the engine to stall. While these events have not been witnessed in nature, they have been proven in lab experiments.\\n\\nMore exotic explanations for the Bermuda Triangle include it being an area of magnetic disturbance, temporal (or time) holes, the location of the lost city of Atlantis, or extra-terrestrial abduction.\n\nAnswer:",

As you start to tip right, you angle the wheel to the right a tiny bit and roll the bike back underneath yourself.  The actions are automatic and subtle, but in order for this mode of balancing to work, the bicycle has to be moving, otherwise turning the wheel doesn't do anything.\\n\\nThe other balancing, moving your body back over the bicycle, is more difficult, and less important, so most people never get to practise it during their normal use of a bicycle.\\n\\nGyroscopic effects are unimportant, even moving very, very slowly on a bicycle with very light wheels is much easier to balance than being stopped on the same bicycle.\n\nAnswer:",

My ex still hasn't accepted the fact, however he leaves me alone.  Haven't seen nor heard from him in years.  I like it this way.  Their ego just won't let them accept the fact that there is life without them.  He will eventually get the message and just go away.  Wish there was something else I could say, but this is the way I see it.\n\nAnswer:",

I asked him just to wear it around me if he doesnt want to wear it all the time. He hasn't even done that. Maybe I should just squirt some on him myself??

It's worth noting that both times they've won the competition they had young squads (26 yrs & 3 mths in '78, 26 yrs 10 mths in '86). Also note that they took an older squad to Korea/Japan (28 yrs & 5 mths by my calculations). \\nI think they have a number of very exciting players. My personal favourites being Cambiasso, Riquelme, Messi & Crespo. \\nThey'll definitely be a hard team to beat, and I'm sure they'll make it at least as far as the semis - if not becoming the eventual winners.\n\nAnswer:",

Octopus has 8 legs.?\nQuestion: If \"octo\" is eight, Why is October the tenth month?\nAnswer: In most places, until the adoption of the Gregorian calendar, 25 March (the date known as the Annunciation of Mary) was the first day of the new year. Eventually this was changed to 1 January (a date associated with the Circumcision of Christ). Some of the month names indicate their position relative to the March year beginning - September, October, November, and December are formed from root words meaning \"seven\", \"eight\", \"nine\", and \"ten\", respectively. When the first of the year was changed to January, they became the 9th, 10th, 11th, and 12th months, but kept their original names.\n\nAnswer:",

This is necessary because calculus breeds bacteria, which attributes to periodontitis. If this condition advances it actually reduces the amount of bone in your upper and lower jaw. This will cause your teeth to become loose, and you may lose them. If a dentist recommends a dental scaling, it is best to have it done.\n\nAnswer:",

That way, I don't have to sit there and watch them wilt away.\\n\\nHaving said that, though, I have a relative who loves getting flowers, and do occasionally send her some (mainly because she prefers flowers above all other gifts).

Is it true that Russian women always add an 'a' to the end of the last name? Also, how are patronymic names chosen? What are some common female patronymic names? Thanks.\nAnswer: If you are born outside of Russia, you usually do not add 'a' to the end of your Russian last name. Otherwise, we always do. It is not really our choice, but the way language works. In Russia, middle names are patronymic. For example, a man named Ivan whose father's name is Nikolay would be known as Ivan Nikolayevich or \"Ivan, son of Nikolay\" (with Nikolayevich as a patronymic). For women, the ending is -yevna or -ovna.\n\nAnswer:",

The distance between bases was already established as 90 feet, which it remains to this day. Through trial and error, 90 feet had been settled upon as the optimal distance. 100 feet would have given too much advantage to the defense, and 80 feet too much to the offense. As athleticism has improved on both sides of the equation, 90 feet remains the appropriate balance between hitting and fielding, as it continues to provide frequent tests between the speed of a batter-runner and the throwing arm of a fielder.\\n\\nThe rules consist of twenty general guidelines to the rules of baseball. The organization for which the guidelines were drawn up was the early 1840s New York ball club called the Knickerbockers.\\n\\nMany of the rules, formalized by Alexander Cartwright on September 23, 1845, were derived from earlier sources, but their compilation by the Knickerbocker Club provided a basis for modern adult organized baseball, in contrast to the various schoolyard ball games that had been around for generations previous.\n\nAnswer:",

The product could include anything from traditional goods and services, to celebrities, or works of entertainment.\\n\\nFrom a marketing perspective, publicity is one of the variables that comprise the promotional mix. The other components of promotions are advertising, sales promotion, and personal selling. Promotion is one of the variables that comprise the marketing mix.\\n\\nPublicity is closely related to public relations. Whereas public relations is the management of all communications between the firm and the general public, publicity is the management of product or brand related communications between the firm and the general public. It is primarily an informative activity (as opposed to a persuasive one), but its ultimate goal is to promote the companies products, services, or brands. A publicity plan is a planned program aimed at obtaining favorable press coverage for a companies products.\n\nAnswer:",

Here's some info.\\n\\nFlatland is a BMX riding style that is performed on smooth flat surfaces, often with flatland specific frames, front & rear bolt on axle pegs, a hollow stem bolt for the front brake cable, and rear brake detangler or \"gyro\" to facilitate the bars being able to rotate endlessy without tangling the brake cables. Also invented specifically for flatland bmx riding was the rear hub mechanism called a \"freecoaster\", that allows the rear wheel to roll backwards without engaging the hub to make the pedals rotate around. Other technical bicycle setup specifics can include narrow handlebars, rear hand brakes and a Gyro rear brake cable detangler device, very high pressure tires, and a very small front sprocket. But in concept, any BMX bike with axle pegs could be used for flatland riding.\\n\\nIn a contest, your talent and skill is judged by your ability to maintain coordination and balance while performing a variety of difficult and elegant moves. There are usually several categories for judging purposes which can include:\\n\\nnumber of touches, i.e. = the number of times a rider does not complete their trick and/or touches their foot to the ground \\nnumber of tricks completed in the alloted time \\ndifficulty of the tricks; which can be very subjective, as flatland bmx has become as (if not, more) technical in many ways as figure skating and breakdancing \\noriginality of the tricks performed; which again is fairly subjective \\nstyle and flow; which means how smooth and/or stylish did the rider perform their moves during the contest run. \\nFlatland is an involving, time-consuming discipline where the rider learns different balance, counter-balance points and center-of-gravity in motion through repetition and trial-and-error. Some tricks can be learned in hours, others may take years to achieve.\\n\\nSome flatland riders would refer to flatland as a type of art, and would place the emphasis on being original, while others consider having the most or hardest tricks the important thing, and still others ride just for fun. There is no right or wrong, and only contest riders need to be concerned with the competitive side of things, as there are many riders who prefer doing shows, having parts in videos, or simply riding with their friends and enjoying themselves as much as winning a contest.\\n\\nRiders usually pedal a few times for speed, and perform various stunts often involving difficult and/or awkward stances on pegs, mounted to the axle of their front or back wheels. Pegs are hollow metal tubes, which are bolted onto both sides of the front and back axles. When flatland riding first came into being, most riders would do one trick, and then get back to the pedals and that was it, but by combining different body, and bicycle positions, into \"combos\" and \"linking\" them together, riders challenge themselves further by doing several tricks in a row without stopping inbetween each move. Flatland riding is usually a combination of many different kinds of moves, often linked together in a non-stop fashion as the rider goes through as few as 2 or 3, or as many as 10-12 moves, and position or direction changes in a row, and then finally returning their feet to the pedals. It has been somewhat unelegantly compared to both ice skating, and breakdancing, and really, it is its own thing, but those comparisons will give you a vague idea of what to expect to see.\\n\\nNotable flatland BMX legends include Bob Haro,Kevin Jones, Chase Gouin, Ross Smith, Bill Neumann, Pete Brandt, Jesse Puente, Chad Degroot, Andrew Faris and Trevor Meyer. Modern flatland legends that have influenced other riders include Simon O'Brien, Martti Kuoppa, Mat Wilhelm, Phil Dolan, Lee Musselwhite, Jeff Desroche, Cory Fester, Percy Marshall, Stephan Cerra, Terry Adams, and Tanaka Kotaro.\\n\\nStall moves were among the first flatland tricks invented, they require good control o\n\nAnswer:",

Having many people love you seems a bit selfish and never loving anyone shouldn't be an option. One way you can find a happy medium with this is to actually love people; and this doesn't mean having sex either because love and sex are two different things. If you love people you won't have to scale from people loving you to never loving anyone. But your question seems like you're saying that people should give you love or else you're not gonna give it.

Post credible source.?\nAnswer: (taken directly from Wikipedia; words within < > are linked under sources):\\n\\nThe Constitution does not specify the size of the Supreme Court; instead, Congress has the power to fix the number of Justices. Originally, the total number of Justices was set at six by the <Judiciary Act of 1789>. As the country grew geographically, the number of Justices steadily increased. The court was expanded to seven members in 1807, nine in 1837 and ten in 1863. \\n\\nIn 1866, however, Congress wished to deny President Andrew Johnson any Supreme Court appointments, and therefore passed the <Judicial Circuits Act>, which provided that the next three Justices to retire would not be replaced; thus, the size of the Court would eventually reach seven by attrition. Consequently, one seat was removed in 1866 and a second in 1867. By the <Circuit Judges Act of 1869>, the number of Justices was again set at nine (the Chief Justice and eight Associate Justices), where it has remained ever since. \\n\\nINTERESTING NOTE: President Franklin D. Roosevelt attempted to expand the Court (see Judiciary Reorganization Bill of 1937); his plan would have allowed the President to appoint one new, additional justice for every justice who reached the age of seventy but did not retire from the bench, until the Court reached a maximum size of fifteen justices. Ostensibly, this was to ease the burdens of the docket on the elderly judges, but it was widely believed that the President's actual purpose was to add Justices who would favor his New Deal policies, which had been regularly ruled unconstitutional by the Court. The plan failed in Congress and the court changed course (see the switch in time that saved nine). In any case, Roosevelt's long tenure in the White House allowed him to appoint a large number of Justices.\n\nAnswer:",

Iraq stands at the top of a growing list of concerns that Americans have about the leadership of the country.\\n\\nIraq has become a quagmire with no good solution in sight.  To stay invites more of our young men and women to lose some part of the life they could have had without fighting such a needless battle.  To leave now suggests those who have already lost did so for no good reason.  \\n\\nThe question many Americans ask is: who got us here?  It's too late to punish President Bush; even if they wanted to, John Kerry never seemed presidential enough to do the job.  With the mid-term elections just ahead, they may likely look to those who have championed Bush's cause again and again and take it out on them.

I mean, I didn't get it, it was confusing. I guess the confusing and unpredictable part makes the show addictive.\nAnswer: There was quite a bit we learned during the finale. Here's some of the more important stuff. For more information, check out the source.\\n\\n--- http://www.lostpedia.com/wiki/Push_the_Button ---\\nThe button serves as a venting mechanism for electromagnetic energy located within the sealed portion of The Swan. The \"incident\", according to Kelvin was a leak of said energy from it's containment. Geological anomalies in the Island cause this energy to build up over time. After 108 minutes, the energy buildup is large enough that failure to vent the energy has catastrophic results. It has not yet been revealed why the values are not (cannot be?) automatically entered by a mechanical device or computer program, rather than by human beings. Desmond failed to push the button on-time on September 22, 2004 , triggering a system failure. Although the sequence was entered shortly after the time expired, the resulting magnetic burst was assumed to be strong enough to cause Flight 815 to crash.\\n\\n--- http://www.lostpedia.com/wiki/Snowglobe ---\\nThe island is refered to as such by Desmond, in episode Live Together, Die Alone, after attempting to flee from the vicinity in his sailboat, implying that there is no conventional means to get away from it. He bases that assumption to the fact that he was sailing for about two and a half weeks in the open sea, on 9 knots (speed of travelling), heading west, and, as he states, that should place him in the Fiji in less than a week (Desmond is an experienced sailor; he participated in a sailboat world race and that's how he ended up on the island). Desmond's assumption is later confirmed when the man refered to as Henry Gale (maybe He?), who also appears to be a leader figure among the others, tells Michael that, once he is rescued, there is no way he could find the way back to the island. We have to presume, of course, that the word \"rescue\" carries its ordinary connotation (the way the survivors mean it).\n\nAnswer:",

There are three main kinds of botulism. Foodborne botulism is caused by eating foods that contain the botulism toxin. Wound botulism is caused by toxin produced from a wound infected with Clostridium botulinum. Infant botulism is caused by consuming the spores of the botulinum bacteria, which then grow in the intestines and release toxin. All forms of botulism can be fatal and are considered medical emergencies. Foodborne botulism can be especially dangerous because many people can be poisoned by eating a contaminated food.\\n\\nSo it's an infection caused by a toxin.\n\nAnswer:",

And if you could convert the price to gallons instead of litres it would also help a lot. I just need to know this for an English project. I heard from my Intro to Business teacher it was $8 but then I heard that was wrong. But then why are gas prices so much higher over there than compared to here in the US? I mean the oil companies probably make less money over there with all the compact and/or hybrid cars yet Americans still have these V8's that get like 11 miles to the gallon.\nAnswer: From the table given in the Source, here are a selection of Western European gas prices (Regular in USD/Gallons, as requested).\\n\\nUK  TEESIDE  $5.64\\nUK MILFORD HAVEN $5.56\\nUK READING $5.56\\nUK NORWICH $5.54\\n (UK Average: $5.58)\\nGERMANY FRANKFURT  $5.29\\nDENMARK COPENHAGEN  $5.08\\nNORWAY STAVANGER $5.07\\nNORWAY OSLO         $4.93\\n (Norway Average: $5.00)\\nITALY ROME         $4.86\\nPORTUGAL LISBON  $4.80\\nSWITZERLAND  GENEVA  $4.56\\nAUSTRIA  VIENNA  $4.50\\n\\nThe average overall is about $4.96.\\n\\nA large portion of the gas prices are taxes, which constitute about 60% of the price of gas in Europe--as opposed to an average of 42% in the United States.  Additionally, European countries produce much less oil domestically than than the U.S.\n\nAnswer:",

Both these currents have a frequency of at least fifty cycles per second and will cause a tetanic contraction of voluntary muscle, so for this purpose, the two currents are interchangeable and therefore referred to as Faradic-type current.  \\nFaradic current (faradism) is produced from an interrupted direct current (DC), derived either from batteries or rectified mains current.  Sinusoidal current is obtained from the AC street current by suitable modification through a step-down transformer.\"\n\nAnswer:",

Alcohol, tomatoes, spices, chocolate, caffeine, citrus drinks, artificial sweeteners and acidic foods may irritate your bladder. That makes symptoms worse. Try removing these things from your diet for a couple of weeks. Then try eating one food at a time to see if it makes your symptoms worse. \\nSmoking. Many people with interstitial cystitis find that smoking makes their symptoms worse. Because smoking is also a main cause of bladder cancer, people with interstitial cystitis have another good reason to quit smoking. \\nBladder training. Many people can train their bladder to urinate less often. You can train your bladder by going to the bathroom at scheduled times and using relaxation techniques. \\nPhysical therapy and biofeedback. People with interstitial cystitis may have painful spasms of pelvic floor muscles. If you have muscle spasms, you can learn exercises to help strengthen and relax your pelvic floor muscles. \\nTENS (this stands for \"transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation\"). You can use a TENS machine to put mild electrical pulses into your body through special wires. Some doctors think that electrical pulses increase blood flow to the bladder. The increased blood flow strengthens the muscles that help control the bladder. It also releases hormones that block pain.\n\nAnswer:",

At the subatomic level, matter behaves very differently to classical mechanics that we are familiar with in everyday life. The spin property of particles is not actually the particle spinning like a top, but is a term given to their angular momentum to help explain their interaction with each other.\\n\\nParticles can only spin in certain allowable directions, electrons have only 2 directions, other particles can have more. The ability to be in 2 spin states at once is due to uncertainty in that the particle could be in either state until it is observed and probability functions are used to describe its state.\\n\\nSimilarly a particle in a quantum well (a box with walls of electric potential) will move about with its energy in a fashion that can be described by its wave function. At any measurement it will be in a certain point (although with unknown momentum) but it will vary with every measurement.\\n\\nThese sorts of uncertainties are what are scientists are hoping to use in quantum mechanics. Calculations will actually be performed millions of times simultaneously providing varying results, but favourable probabilities will lead to the correct answer with immeasurably small innaccurary.\\n\\nPotential methods will utilise the spin magnetic moments of electrons, or the position of valence (outer) or free electrons moving between pairs of ions (charged atoms) accurately positioned in a semiconductor. There is still a lot of work required.\n\nAnswer:",

For scholarship, it belongs to many factors including your ACT, GPA, and what school you apply to.  With this score + G.P.A  over 3.5, you may get full tuition for 4 years in some good universities.  You can apply to top universities, but I don't know if you can get full tuition because almost (if not 100%), their students got scores over 30.\n\nAnswer:",

This mechanism is indirect; insulin binds to its receptor and promotes glucose transporter expression on the cell surface.  No glucose transporter - glucose can't get into the cell (the cell membrane is essentially impermiable to glucose).  Note that brain and liver are insensitive to insulin.\n\nAnswer:",

We must all learn to operate with a more sophisticated understanding of the American use of the term \"democracy\" in the first instance.  It doesn't mean (and has never meant) that everyone has an equal say in how things get done.  If that were true, we would all have equal access to our elected representatives.  We do not.  Look at the impact of lobbyists, special interests groups, political action committees, and cronyism on our governmental processes.  It's naive to think that we all have a say.  Still, it is important, as individuals, to remain involved in the process and to let our public officials know how THEY can best serve OUR needs.  When enough of us speak in concert, those who listen stay in office; those who don't don't.\n\nAnswer:",

Later he campaigned to put ronald reagan on Mt. Rushmore, claiming that he voted for him when in fact he never did. He then became a devious drug addict who violated federal drug laws and got off scott free, due his contacts in the republican-led government, for whom he is a loyal parrot. He now calls himself rush limbaugh, his 4th alias!

I think we gravitate to what makes sense to us a man who refuses to let his religion interfere in legislation some believe can't be trusted.  I agree with Ann Coulter it boils down a relgious belief but both sides have their extreme representives the self-proclaimed Joan of Arcs and Buddah's.  All politics is faith based it's just a matter of where one invests his faith.  The problem with defining them comes when one side defines the other based on contrary views but that's politics.

Are there problems?   Obviously, but anyone with a brain can see that good things are happening also.\\n\\nWhat do you think?\nAnswer: Because liberals control the media and they will stop at nothing to get Republicans out of office. Good news from Iraq would help Republicans stay in power and it will make George W. Bush look good and they loathe him.\n\nAnswer:",

They had a working direct model which enabled them to get payment up-front, even before they purchased raw materials to make their equipment. Other vendors were tied into agreements with retailers and distributors which meant that they had to give these people commissions and it also reduced their flexibility. Dell also had strong alliances with suppliers which gave them an ability to quickly change to new products without taking a hit on existing inventories. In essence, Dell have cash, and lots of it, they are able to drop prices easily, out-competing the competition, and they have an ability to switch to new products quickly which enables them to take advantage of rapid changes in the market.\n\nAnswer:",

He felt that because no priests are allowed to engage in any sexual act, pedophiles and even homosexuals who have come to believe that their sexual preference is wrong enter the priesthood because they know they can't have sex anyway, so they feel like the priesthood will prevent those feelings from developing. However, as we've seen, that doesn't always provide a solution.\n\nAnswer:",

If there was low friction, the rope would slide out, or you would have to hold it very very tightly, and this would increase the effort.\\n\\nAs between the pulley and the rope, there is very little friction and exactly this reduces the effort. If the friction was high (e.g. if the pulley was stuck), the required effort would have been higher.\\n\\nIf you're interested in how the wheel reduces friction, it is simple. Say you need to pull something by many meters. If there was no wheel, you would have many meters of high friction movement. If you have a wheel with a circumference of 1m, and its axis has a circumference of 1cm, then for each rotation of the wheel (1m) only the axis slides against the wheel by 1cm. The slide distance is 100 times lower. That's even not accounting for sleeve bearings (reducing friction of the axis). Or, even better, ball bearings.\n\nAnswer:",

But it is not because the sound waves are being affected by gravity.  It is because the medium that the sound travels through is affected by gravity.  The air is thicker at the 1st floor and thinner at the 10th floor.  To make an extreme example it would be like passing sound through water at the 1st floor and air at the 10th.  So yes it will be different sounds but because of the effect of gravity on the medium not the waves.\n\nAnswer:",

There are also three contributions the the red shift and they are only due to gravity   . The only direct observations of star/galaxy motion is for transverse (proper - angular) motion. Changes of light intensity could demonstrate receeding motion but there are other causes of light intensity. See: http//inventing-solutions.com/simplified-universe.htm for details.\nAnswer: Yes there is.\\n\\nSupernova decay curves show the time dilation that would be expected from rapid motion (i.e. taking the redshift as a doppler velocity) so we know it isn't tired light.\\n\\nA lot of other methods of measuring distance have been developed and those are used to calibrate the redshift measurements (by finding the Hubble Constant).\n\nAnswer:",

The rainbow effect is also commonly seen near waterfalls or fountains. Rainbow fringes can sometimes be seen at the edges of backlit clouds and as vertical bands in distant rain or virga. The effect can also be artificially created by dispersing water droplets into the air during a sunny day.\n\nAnswer:",

When I lost my grandmother (she raised me) I felt betrayed, mad, lost, empty. What I did was write letters to her.  I know that sounds dumb but it helped me get it all out.  I did alot of crying, I would be fine one min. and the next I would be crying, I talked to my sister alot, we talked about old times, what it was going to be like without her,  you name it we talked about it.\\n\\nWith each day it gets a bit easier to let go...with each day it doesnt hurt as much.  I still think about my grandmother everyday, when something good or bad happens I still run to the phone and say Oh I have to call grandma, then it hits me shes not there in person but in my heart she will always be.  \\nMy grandmother passed away almost 10 years ago and there are moments when it still hurts...\n\nAnswer:",

Conservatives have been trying to abolish the Department of Education ever since it was created in the 1970s.\\n\\nThe standards NCLB sets are so ridiculous that most districts will be hard pressed to pass them, and are therefore labeled \"failed\" schools. If you school fails, your funding is cut off, making it ever more difficult to raise standards because you have ever fewer resources.\\n\\nIt's a well-designed plan to make it look like Bush cares about education, while in reality shafting the public education system.\\n\\nHouse Democrats have done some good work on this:\\nhttp://www.house.gov/budget_democrats/analyses/spending/education_nov1303.pdf\\n\\nhttp://www.house.gov/budget_democrats/analyses/education_bush_history.pdf\n\nAnswer:",

It's kind of weird to think about, because you're a totally new person. How long does that process take?\nAnswer: Some cells don't regenerate ever (nerve cells).  Some cells are constantly regenerating (red blood cells).  Red blood cells only have a lifespan of a week.\n\nAnswer:",

In fact, when CO2 levels were over ten times higher than they are now, about 450 million years ago, the planet was in the depths of the absolute coldest period in the last half billion years.\" Patterson asked the committee, \"On the basis of this evidence, how could anyone still believe that the recent relatively small increase in CO2 levels would be the major cause of the past century's modest warming?\" \\n\\n\"The man is an embarrassment to US science and its many fine practitioners, a lot of whom know (but feel unable to state publicly) that his propaganda crusade is mostly based on junk science.\"\nAnswer: He's not, Professor Patterson is the exception to most of the scientific community with regard to global warming.

I am filled with the Holy Ghost and am a Christian. I no longer feel like that, but was made a overcomer of it through Jesus Christ. For those who battle fear there is peace in God. God has given me discernment and the devil is a liar and will do anything to seperate you from God and fear can come in all shapes and forms.\nAnswer: I havebeen recently battling this demon of fear myself. I am not happy in my current job and want to move on, but i fear failure. I really hate feeling this way because I know GOD did not give us a spirit of fear, but love, peace and a sound mind. I am praying on this and I know GOD will deliver me. GOD Bless you.\n\nAnswer:",

Where can I take private lessons at after school and during the summer? Or do I have to take classes at a community college?\nAnswer: The best place to look would be on the web, using a local search. There are a few sites out there that can direct you, Yahoo for one, the other is www.clickforlessons.com. They help find instructors for students. You can search for free on their site and see if they have any foreign language instructors in your area. You would probably learn faster if you find a private instructor as opposed to taking a class at a community college. The only issue is $$$. The private lessons may cost more. Good luck!\n\nAnswer:",

That would mean that inner city dwellers are simply worse people than others. As for your question, lack of a quality education may have some effect. However, both crime and lack of education, although simultaneously influencing each other, could be seen better as symptoms of the conditions in inner cities, rather than one thing causing another. I believe the economic conditions in inner cities cause them both.\n\nAnswer:",

When the contents of the colon pass through more slowly there is an opportunity for toxins and carcinogens (substances which may induce cancer) to be in prolonged contact with the bowel wall which is where cancer starts.  Fiber, docusate sodium, and milk of magnesia (depending upon various factors) should regulate your bowel habit without the need for laxatives.\n\nAnswer:",

They have no effect in increasing the natural capacity of the erectile chambers, which is a necessity if permanent gains are to be achieved. There are no well-documented scientific studies of the long-term effects of pumping. However, excessive pumping or the use of a too intense vacuum can have detrimental side effects. Lymph blisters are common and men often notice a reduction in sensitivity and problems achieving firm erections. Moreover, burst or ruptured blood vessels can lead to bruising and at worst even hemorrhaging.\\n\\nFor these reasons, only pumps with an accurate and reliable pressure gauge should ever be used and instructions should always be followed carefully.\n\nAnswer:",

I think he's jealous because I'm his senior. It won't help to report him because he makes sure we're always alone when he says nasty things to me. In front of others he'll be nice an cooperative, like there's nothing wrong. He always threatens to report me for things I haven't done, like talking to my friends on the telephone or entertaining my friends on the company's account. How do I get him to stop pestering me?\nAnswer: If it's not possible to record him, just tell him if he doesn't stop harrassing you, you're going to spread a rumour that he's gay or something that you know he'll be scared of. Good luck.\n\nAnswer:",

The purpose of password cracking might be to help a user recover a forgotten password (though installing an entirely new password is less of a security risk), to gain unauthorized access to a system, or as a preventative measure by the system administrator to check for easily crackable passwords\n\nAnswer:",

A state which previously had been considered \"cured\" with democracy putting people to death for conversion?  It makes you wonder what the fuck we spent all that money on.\\n\\nAlso when it comes down to it Bush can't run again.  He doesn't have to build his own approval rating so long as the Republican party stays popular (the Dubai ports deal and immigration are issues the party will continue to criticize Bush for, at least in rhetoric). In this manner they will continue to sign away things like bankruptcy protections (best for credit companies), Tort protections (best for big insurance companies, and no, medical costs won\u2019t go down for most medical work), and immigration law (best for big manufacturing companies).\\n\\nThe list goes on.

The same catfish with all its fins, healthy, swimming with confidence, has a much greater chance of not being eaten. His chances go from 0% to about 50%. Also blood in the water will set them into a frenzy. They prefer to attack the wounded, sick, and dying.\\n\\nAlso there are close to 100 species of piranha and only four known dangerous species. One of those four is called the Red Bellied Piranha. It is possible they were not swimming with this particularly nasty species but with one of over 90 more docile species.\n\nAnswer:",

Gold is particularly good as a hedge against inflation, so if you're afraid of declining purchasing power of the dollar, gold may do well.  On the other hand, gold is a sterile investment, in that it doesn't produce any income.  It doesn't earn anything!  You're just counting on the fact that perhaps someone will value it more next year.  Maybe so, maybe not.\\n\\nI think the best strategy is to hold a small portion of gold as part of a larger investment strategy, but it would seem very unwise to put everything into gold.\n\nAnswer:",

I want to start with my abs and legs.  My question is what are good exercises to get killer abs and what is good to trim down the saddlebags??  Thanks for your help and please no idiot answers..\nAnswer: mix it up with situps and crunches.  When you go up hold yourself in the half way up position then go all the way up then hold in the halfway down position then all the way down.  Give yourself time to feel the burn when holding in the halfway positions.\\nDo about 20 to 30 minutes of this everyday.  Also do not rest in the down position.  This will give you nice abs quickly.\\nFor faster results do this in the morning as soon as you wakeup then again before going to sleep.\\nBe sure to stretch your abs EVERY time you do this. before and after.\\nGood luck!\n\nAnswer:",

Because we are on a tight budget, we are planning to go out to dinner after our wedding and small \"cake and punch\" reception.  We want everyone to know that they are welcome to join us - but on seperate tabs.  How can we go about making it known to everyone that we'd love the company, but dinner is \"Dutch Treat?\"  It seems most people don't know what \"going Dutch\" means anymore, and we want to be clear, but not tacky or rude.  I can't find anything about it on any of the \"Etiquette\" websites.\nAnswer: Etiquette wise, your wedding requires no treat.  If your wedding is at 3 in the afternoon, that would make your reception start at about 3:30 or 4:00.  This is not a time that people usually eat dinner, so a cake and punch reception would suffice.  No one should be expecting a full meal at 4:00.  If you guys party and mingle until about 6:00, then that's just in time for everyone to get home before dinner time.\n\nAnswer:",

The dodo was a flightless member of the pigeon family. Fully grown dodos weighted about 23 kg (50 pounds). Around 1505 the Portuguese became the first Europeans to discover the dodo. By 1681 it had been driven to extinction by humans and the feral dogs, pigs, rats, and monkeys introduced by Europeans to Mauritius. The dodo was not the only Mauritian bird driven to extinction in recent centuries. Of the 45 bird species originally found, only 21 still survive. Two bird species closely related to the dodo also became extinct: the Reunion solitaire by 1746, and the Rodrigues solitaire by 1790. Reports of sightings of living dodos in the 1990s on Mauritius prompted William J. Gibbons to mount expeditions to search for them. None were found.\n\nAnswer:",

The best theory I could find was that you yawn because you're not getting enough oxygen to the brain (maybe there is a lack of oxygen in the space you're standing).  Whenever you're aware of someone yawning, it activates a reaction in your subconscious mind that acts as a threat response.  Basically, whenever you see someone yawn, it makes you body think there is a shortage of oxygen too, and you yawn in response.  No one knows if this is actually the case, but I think that it is a good theory.\n\nAnswer:",

Here is a general guide for Korea: \\n\\n* GREETING GESTURES\\no Among themselves, bowing is the traditional form for both greeting and departing.\\no Western and Korean male friends usually greet with both a slight bow and shaking hands. When shaking hands, both hands are sometimes used. Women usually do not shake hands, especially with men, but usually just nod slightly. The senior person offers to shake hands first, but the junior person bows first. However, shake hands with a light grip and perhaps with eyes averted.\\no Avoid hugging and kissing when greeting.\\no Prolonged direct eye contact is considered impolite and even intimidating.\\no Business cards are traded respectfully. Keep the card on the table in front of you as just one small gesture of respect.\\no When saying good-bye, the traditional gesture is the bow, but the younger generation has adopted the western custom of waving good-bye by moving their arm side-to-side.\\n* TOUCHING GESTURES\\no Generally speaking, the Koreans are not a touch-oriented society (especially true for visitors.) So avoid touching or any prolonged form of body contact.\\no Public display of affection are very rare. On the other hand, you may note people of the same sex walking hand-in-hand, which is simply a gesture of friendship.\\no Don't worry about a bit of pushing in stores or when groups board public buses or trains. Apologies are neither offered or expected.\\n* BECKONING GESTURES\\no The open hand or the middle finger is used for pointing.\\no To beckon someone, the palm faces downward and the fingers are moved in a scratching motion. Using the arm and hand up, palm toward the face is used only for calling dogs and children.\\n* OTHER NONVERBAL GESTURES\\no Respect is always shown to elderly people, so it is appropriate to rise when a person-- especially an elderly man enters the room or giving up a seat on a subway. However, an elder may not give up a seat for a young boy.\\no Men generally have priority in Korea: Go through a door first, walk ahead of women, and women may help them on with their coats.\\no Among the Koreans, laughter is used to disguise many emotions: anger, frustration, and fear.\\no Loud talking or laughing is usually avoided. Koreans, especially women will cover their mouths laughing, resulting in giggling rather than wide open-mouth laughing.\\no Periods of silence are common and accepted, even during dinners.\\no Correct posture is important, especially when seated. Don't slouch or put your feet on desks or chairs. Try to maintain a balanced posture, stand or sit erectly or squarely. When seated have both feet squarely on the ground with arms in the lap or on the armrests. Crossing the legs at the knees or ankles is the preferred form rather than with one ankle over the other knee.\\no When walking in public, keep to the left side of the walkway and stairway.\\n* OTHER NONVERBAL GESTURES\\no It is considered impolite to enter a room without knocking first. However, Koreans may not wait for you to come to the door and open it. They may knock and then enter.\\no When walking in public places, direct eye contact is uncommon in the larger cities. However, visitors may be the subject of much curiosity and therefore you may notice some stares.\\no Blowing you nose in public is considered rude, especially at a meal. Paper tissues are used for blowing the nose and then discarded.\\no When entering a private home, it is usually customary to remove your shoes.\\no Spitting (except for young women) and burping in public is acceptable.\n\nAnswer:",

They enjoy travelling and exploration, the more so because their minds are constantly open to new dimensions of thought. They are basically ambitious and optimistic, and continue to be so even when their hopes are dashed. Their strongly idealistic natures can also suffer many disappointments without being affected. They are honorable, honest, trustworthy, truthful, generous and sincere, with a passion for justice. They are usually on the side of the underdog in society they will fight for any cause they believe to be just, and are prepared to be rebellious. They balance loyalty with independence.

Each species of mammal has at least one kind of \"hair\" or fur. Many species have several different specialized types. For example, cat whiskers are very different from regular cat fur in texture and length. One of the main differences in hair is whether it is determinate in length (grows to a certain length and stops) or indeterminate in length (grows for as long as it is alive.) Humans have both kinds in different places on the body. Head hair, scalp and face, is indeterminate. Body hair, arms, underarms, legs, pubic area, fingers and toes is determinate. The only determinate hairs on the head are normal eyebrows, ear hair and nose hairs. I think the reason is obvious. \"Wild hairs\" are determinate hairs that have encountered a genetic failure. The length possibilities of each type of hair from sheep's wool to seal fur are genetically determined.  Pubic hair is a secondary sex characteristic that signals availability for mating. It is not designed to cover, conceal, protect, or warm the area that produces it. It may have some scent retaining or focusing function too. This is still debatable. I hope this helps.\n\nAnswer:",

She has enacted a drama as she did in 2004. This will help to improve her image in the media and not among the public. But the opposition parties have no moral grounds to raise their voice in the Office of Profit issue. BJP has walked out of parliament regarding this issue. But they are the first to enact a law in Jharkand to prevent disqualification of their MLAs. They are opposing it at National level.\\n\\nLeft parties are getting the maxm advt. in the new law to avoid disqualification of MPs.\\n\\nSo no body have the moral ground to talk regarding this issue.

We have a month to try and help with diet and exercise.  Need help with the diet side.  Thanks!\nAnswer: When you eat, your body converts any food you don't need right away into triglycerides. Therefore, simply reducing the total amount of food you eat would reduce triglyceride levels. In addition to the amount of food, the kind of food matters, too. Avoid sugary foods, since they can raise triglycerides more than other healthy foods. Alcohol also has an even more potent ability to raise triglycerides, so avoid it. The same foods you would eat to be heart healthy (whole grains, low fat dairy, green vegetables) are the ones you would eat to reduce triglycerides. The Mayo Clinic has a wonderful article on this subject; please give it a click.  Good luck. http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/triglycerides/CL00015\n\nAnswer:",

The first step is the aerobic budding and multiplication phase where the yeast grows in numbers.

But say you have a planet in a circular orbit.  Give it a little extra speed in the direction it's going.  Now it has too much centrifugal force, and it begins to gain distance from the star -- but that means it's gaining potential energy and so must be losing kinetic energy.  So it slows down.  The detailed math shows that by the time it's gone 180 degrees around it has lost so much speed that, even though it is farther from the star, now it doesn't have enough centrifugal force to counteract gravity, so it begins to speed up.  Again, if you do the math, you see that it will return to the exact position it was at when you gave it the extra push, and with the exact same velocity it had just after that push.  So it will just keep repeating that orbit, which is highest (and slowest) at one point and lowest (and fastest) 180 degrees around; in other words, an elliptical orbit.\n\nAnswer:",

She's pissed and said it's over. How should I handle this?\nQuestion: Things went sour and we ended sleeping in separate rooms. Things started getting better and she's asked me to sleep in her room for the last three nights. But what happened was that in the morning she couldn't find her keys so I told her to go ahead I'll come straight home after work. That evening around 7pm she called me and said she's going out and may stay at a friend's house. I told her I'm going out and to call me when she's on her way home. \\nAround 8:30pm I called her but she didn't pick up. I went to my friend's house and around 1am we went to his sister's house. I put my phone on the car charger. We got to his sister's house and I forgot my phone in the car. \\n\\nI got back to my car around 3am and I saw she called about 20 times. \\nI called her and basically she said it's over and she can't trust me. She said she was going to put my clothes out. But I went by that night to take a look and she didn't do it. I'm concerned that my hard work went down the drain and she's serious.\nAnswer: Do both of you want this relationship to work?

Is it cost per contact?\nQuestion: Assuming that the contacts are the company's target market, how do they put a $ amount on the contacts? What are some ways companies justify the said amount? Is there a formula or is it all about selling the opportunity?\nAnswer: The value is based on how targeted the contact list is. A list of blue eyed, left handed red sox fans is harder to compile than a list of people between the ages of 18 and 32 who live in the northeast. For that reason the value of the sox fans would be worth a hell of a lot more.\\n\\nThe more focused and targeted the list, the more it is worth.\\n\\nGeneric lists like age, region, salary, gender, income level are easy to compile and should cost no more that $100 for every 1,000 names.\\n\\nMore detailed lists like horse owners who compete in jumping competitions may be worth as much as $500 per 1,000 names.\\n\\nAnd super detailed lists like doctors who have three or more childern between the ages of 2 and 18 and live in large cities can command as much as $5,000 per thousand names.

I really need help on not screwing this up?\nQuestion: I stopped working about a year ago. I told my boss that I was unhappy and I wanted to tell her that I was in the process of looking for another job. I told her that I intended to use my lunch breaks and half-days to go on interviews and I did not anticipate leaving for about 6 months.I never resigned. I did this because I needed the money until I found another job, and so she would not be stranded by me giving her only 2 weeks.\\n\\nLess than a month later I came into work, went into my office and all of my stuff was boxed up and there was someone at my desk on my computer- deleting and copying files. Everyone was shocked to see me there. I logged onto another computer and received and email which stated it was officially my last day with the company. \\n\\nI made an unemployment claim and was given compensation for the 6 months I intended to stay there.\\n\\nWhat do I say at the interview? Was I fired, laid off, or did I quit? Is this too much drama for a prospective employer?\nAnswer: Well to start off, congratulations for being totally upfront and honest with your former employer about leaving the company.  Even though it seems you were punished for this, it was totally the right thing to do; you have nothing to be ashamed of or anything to feel that you should hide, which you would have had if you had been sneaky or deceitful.  So, that is something a new employer should definitely take into consideration.\\nIf I were in your spot, I would be up front and honest about the situation without tearing apart the former boss or company.  I quit my job back inJanuary due to physical and emotional stress, and am just now trying to find a job.  It's taken me that long to get over the damage done to my heart.  I have asked prospective employers to not speak with my former employer, and I tell them the truth:  that it was a very hostile environment and that I am not comfortable with anyone at that company knowing what is going on in my life.  I have, however, given references of people who worked there when I did that are no longer there that I am okay with.  The two places I have been interviewed this week were very understanding.  Mostly, they appreciated my honesty.  But, I was also careful to not tear apart anybody, either.  I think that helped.\\nIf you let them know your version of what happened while being respectful of the people involved and they call your old boss who lets her mouth run off about what a louse you are and drags your reputation through the mud and they choose to listen to her, it's probably not the place for you to be anyway.  Chances are they will compare your respectfulness to her disrespect and you'll win out anyway.  In any case, you'll be able to look at yourself in the mirror the next day, knowing you have done the right thing, no matter the outcome. \\nBest wishes!\n\nAnswer:",

This aromatic resin oozed down the sides of trees, as well as filling internal fissures, trapping debris, such as seeds, leaves, feathers and insects. As geologic time progressed the forests were buried and the resin hardened into a soft, warm, golden gem, known as amber. Amber is the fossilized resin of ancient trees which forms through a natural polymerization of the original organic compounds. Most of the world's amber is in the range of 30-90 million years old.\n\nAnswer:",

I saw your question and had to try this one.  A few years back I worked for Stanley Hydraulic Tools and the discharge pumps we sold we centrifugal pumps as well.   These pumps as yours are designed to move large volume not pressure. Closing the discharge side off should not damage the pump.....housing or impeller.  We had a hydraulic motor that spun the pump/impeller.  The hydraulic motor was constantly bathed in oil and even in a stall or a closed discharge valve situation the pump was protected.  I would encourage you to find out who the manufacturer of your pump assembly is and make this question out directly to them but I hope this in its self helps!  Hyway.\n\nAnswer:",

There is not a dominant and a recessive gene. Furthermore in incomplete dominance, when both dominant alleles are present in the chromosomes, neither will show up; instead you get a blend of both characteristics. For example in the four o'clock flower, the petal colors white and red exhibit the condition of incomplete dominance. When both white and red alleles are prseent, the result is a pink flower; pink of course being a blend between red and white.\n\nAnswer:",

Plan B contains hormones which can cause these changes to your next period as well as some spotting/break through bleeding. Any bleeding or changes to your next period after taking Plan B have NO relationship to whether or not the Plan B was effective in preventing pregnancy.\n\nAnswer:",

The early temperance writers made this assertion and also insisted that the alcohol in their blood could cause \u201cdrunkards\u201d to catch fire and burn aliveThis combustion argument against drinking was dropped long ago but many anti-alcohol writers continue to promote the idea that even moderate drinking causes brain cells to die.\\nScientific medical research has actually demonstrated that the moderate consumption of alcohol is associated with better cognitive (thinking and reasoning) skills and memory than is abstaining from alcohol. Moderate drinking doesn\u2019t kill brain cells but helps the brain function better into old ageOf course, years of alcohol abuse can cause serious neurological damage, including Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome. Harm can be done to message-carrying dendrites on neurons in the cerebellum, a part of the brain involved in learning and physical coordination. But even in such extreme cases, there\u2019s a lack of evidence that alcohol kills brain cellsHowever, abstinence after chronic alcohol abuse enables brains to repair themselves, according to new research involving rats.People who drink too much and are thinking about either reducing or eliminating their drinking should find these findings encouraging, although humans have not yet been tested directly for the positive brain effects\n\nAnswer:",

For a healthy 37 year old female?\nQuestion: Big fat children belly! May have it removed - I was thinking 4 weeks - am office based worker, at home, but need to be mentally 110% - so need to have moved on to plain paracetomol and have stopped dozing off. Many thanks.\nAnswer: If you start out in top physical condition with strong abdominal muscles, recovery from abdominoplasty will be much faster. Some people return to work after two weeks, while others take three or four weeks to rest and recuperate. After surgery, exercise can help you heal better. Even people who have never exercised before should begin an exercise program to reduce swelling, lower the chance of blood clots, and tone muscles. Vigorous exercise, however, should be avoided until you can do it comfortably.\n\nAnswer:",

Restriction of trade is a Federal Law somewhere and you can't do it - at least not for long once lawyers get involved.  Anyone can operate an ambulance if they meet your State and Local rules.  So long as the rules are the same for everyone is the only way you can get around restriction of trade.  There are places that have laws that the municipalities run the EMS but I have seen them fall to restriction of trade as well.\n\nAnswer:",

It depends on quite a few factors. An enlarged pituitary can cause a \"mass effect\" displacing structures from their normal position, such as the optic chiasma, causing vision difficulties. Also the pituitary controls the secretion of a number of hormones, with varying functions. The best thing for you to do is to speak to your physician/neurosurgeon who will be able to better characterize the lesion and give you a more precise answer to your question.\n\nAnswer:",

Although first postulated in print by a French infantry captain in 1915, infiltration tactics were developed by the German Army and executed from autumn 1917. Their first use is credited to General Oskar von Hutier (1857-1934) in the German Eighth Army\u2019s successful attack on Riga of 1 September 1917, and they were generally known in German circles as \u201cHutier tactics\u201d.\\nInfiltration tactics were a radical departure from orthodox breakthrough assaults against entrenched positions. Instead of following a long preliminary bombardment with a massed infantry rush at wrecked forward trenches, small forces of \u201cstormtroopers\u201d (initially companies, later battalions) were slipped between enemy strongpoints after a short \u201churricane\u201d barrage. Their task was to surprise rear areas and artillery positions while heavily defended positions would be bypassed and dealt with by the main infantry attack, following up to storm frontline trenches, and forward units would be given priority in the use of aircraft support and reinforcements.\n\nAnswer:",

When the moon is near the horizon, the moonlight must pass through much more atmosphere than when the moon is directly overhead. By the time the moonlight reaches your eyes, the blue, green, and purple pieces of visible light have been scattered away by air molecules. That's why you only see yellow, orange, or red.\\n\\nThe moon can have an orange color at any time of the year. Sometimes the moon appears orange even when it's directly overhead. This occurs when there's a lot of dust, smoke, or pollution in the atmosphere. The size of those particles will determine the type of color you will see.\\n\\nHope that helps! ^^\n\nAnswer:",

The world around is just an illusion and that we must have our eyes open to know real truth.\n\nAnswer:",

If so, how long will insiders be restricted from selling?\nQuestion: Does Rule 144 apply? On what dates will insiders be selling?\nAnswer: The lock up period is not made clear by the NYSE.  The NYSE stated members can sell in 3 steps 1 year, 2 year, 3 years.  The NYSE did not give exact dates.  But we are talking about 70% of the value of the company minus the cash the members received.

It will list the scheduled date of the Trustees Sale, the last date you can redeem and for how much.

I think that the stool looks quite normal, it does not appear to be hard, there is no blood, and sometimes it is soft...she cries all the same. so far I have eliminated heavy starchy foods from her diet, if i have to give her I crush it, I give her lots of fruit , juice, milk, veggies, water and porridge, very few snacks or sweet, she takes a daily dose of multi vitamins...DR. recomended- and cod liver oil which we only just started to give to her also on Dr.'s recomendation ....the only constant thing she has had from six months to present is cows milk and porridge made from cornmeal, or wheat.\nAnswer: Give her prunes and juice that has prune juice, or apple juice.  Also do not make an issue over her going potty, you can actually give her psychological problems and there are certain complexs in psychology that I can not rememeber the name of, off hand.  I think she may have a bowel stricture.  Have you had this checked?  By the way take her to another doctor for another evaluation also.  Maybe go to 3 doctors.  You can also buy infant glycerine suppositories, or give her metamucil with lots of water, they have orange flavored.  I am a nurse and have a psychology major also\n\nAnswer:",

I called to ask if there were mild stomach flus going around.  I've been having problems with nausea, some vomiting, queasiness, especially when I think about most foods, stomach pain, and difficulty burping.  I also have a lot of low back pain but that may be unrelated.  When my stomach hurts I sometimes lay down and apply a bit of pressure to my stomach and diaphragm.  They feel quite hard.  \\n\\nMy doctor tells me that problems with the gallbladder can run a whole range of symptoms from mild to severe attacks.  Does anyone have some info. that you could share with me?  The online sites I've been to don't really cover the range of severity.  I have to wait another month for my ultrasound.  That seems excessively long to me.  That's our universal healthcare system for you.\nAnswer: Risk factors:\\nBeing overweight \\nAge- older than 65 \\nFatty diet \\nGenetics \\nBeing a Native American or Hispanic \\nHaving sickle cell anemia \\nCrash dieting \\n\\nSince obesity is so closely linked, maintaining a normal weight is an important, especially for women. Avoiding high-fat meals and \"yo-yo\" weight-loss diets are also good ideas. If your background places you at high risk, avoid taking birth control pills or estrogen.\\n\\nIf your doctor thought that your attacks were on the severe side, or life threatening, he would have you in for an ultrasound immediately.  Try avoiding any fatty or sugary foods at least until you get in.\n\nAnswer:",

I personally wouldn't do such an act but all this drama with prostitution is leading to wealthy pimps and pimpettes.

This is another case of statist legislation wrongfully prohibiting a person doing something they have the right to do with their own body. A person has a natural right (beyond the law) to do what they wish with their own property (including themselves under the principle of self-ownership) without interference from a monopolizing infrastructure corporation like the government.\n\nAnswer:",

It's believed that the parts of their brains that register visual information remain dormant. \\nAccording to this fascinating article by Diego Kaski in the International Medical Students' Journal, even people who lose their sight early in childhood retain visual imagery in their dreams well into adulthood. However, this imagery fades over time. \\n\\nNevertheless, blind people do dream and often describe their dreams in terms of places and surroundings. An article from the University of Santa Cruz notes that blind dreams feature a \"very high percentage of gustatory, olfactory, and tactual sensory references,\" something very unusual for sighted dreamers to experience. \\n\\nFor some intriguing and descriptive quotes on the subject, read Richard Catlett Wilkerson's article \"Dreams of the Blind.\"\n\nAnswer:",

They have also been twitching.  I read that this could be a sign of MS.  I have a doctor appointment soon but, was wondering if anyone could give me any more details.  Thank you.\nAnswer: Spasticity is like a \u201cwicked charley horse.\u201d  Brain injury from stroke sometimes causes muscles to involuntarily contract (shorten or flex) when you try to move your limb, creating stiffness and tightness.\\n\\nWhen a muscle can't complete its full range of motion, the tendons and soft tissue surrounding it can become tight.  This makes stretching the muscle much more difficult.   If left untreated, the muscle can freeze permanently into an abnormal and often painful position.Spasticity in the leg may cause a stiff knee, pointed foot and curling of the toes\\nyou should go to the doctor and get their opinion.. check web md. with your symptoms too..\n\nAnswer:",

Now women usually plop one leg on top of the other when they sit. Does anyone know who or what started this change?\nAnswer: When women wore very tight skirts which were below the knee, they were unable to cross their legs, so they only crossed their ankles to relax.  Now women wear slacks, jeans and shorter skirts that do allow for leg crossing, so that's the preferred stance.  It's comfortable - even if sometimes a little too showy.\n\nAnswer:",

Keep in mind - that from the exercise you're toning up and developing muscle. Muscle weighs more than fat but is compact. So you may actually gain weight but trim down if that makes any sense.

Has exchanged with the Chinese? Likes studying Chinese?\nAnswer: I have a few Chinese friends that I have kept for several years.

I still cannot play go very well (weiqi).\\n\\nI like the way Chinese characters are constructed but it is difficult for me to remember them and they are very small.  I cannot appreciate the beauty of the calligraphy that I would hang it on the wall as a person does a painting.  I know how difficult it is to write with a brush though.  It took longer for me to learn Chinese than to learn French.  It is difficult to get used to the tones.  \\n\\nI like Chinese foods even the fungi and fermented things.  I miss the sweets.  I like some Chinese art.  I like the children's palaces.  I like the exercising before class and in the park.  I think acupuncture may really work.  Qi gong breathing is healthy.  \\n\\nChina is way too crowded, though.  I really felt claustrophobic.\n\nAnswer:",

How depressed would you be to find out that your getting offers for these jobs knowing you can never take the jobs?  I'm fighting for my workers compensation from that employer where I got hurt.  Do you think I should include potential earning capacity as part of my law suit seeing these job offers are with top dollar health systems.?\nAnswer: Absolutely! In addition to your medical expenses and general pain and suffering, your lawyer SHOULD also factor in loss from future earnings..and this is a figure that you can quantify based on the offers you received X expected work life......there is case law that allows for it.....\n\nAnswer:",

Statistically speaking things like crimes and strange phenomena build up around a full moon.  Some posit that this has to do with the fact that our bodies are made up of a high percentage of water.  Similar to the tidal effects, the moon's effect on the human body causes things to go wonky with us hormonally.\n\nAnswer:",

Have I caused the problem ?....Should I be doing something to avoid this happening or is it just part of the system I need not worry about as it does correct itself... I do hope so.  Thankyou.\nAnswer: Virtual memory is what your computer uses when it runs out of static memory or RAM.  You can find out how much RAM you have by right clicking MY COMPUTER--PROPERTIES and it will say towards the bottom 128MB or 512MB.  Windows XP runs best on 384MB or higher.  A memory upgrade is a simple do-it yourself job and you can add memory by going to your local PC store. If you are getting the little yellow yield sign in the system tray by the clock, many times I have seen this to be a cause of SPYWARE, hidden programs are sapping your Virtual Memory.  Update your antivirus software and run Spybot 1.4 (free at www.downloads.com)\n\nAnswer:",

If the humane society is called in and doesn't see anything sufficiently horrible to warrant action then you need to document the offenses yourself (photographic evidence, video, witnesses...).  Once you have created  a 'case' in the form of a file THEN the humane society may be more apt to listen.  What is acceptable in one US state or Canadian province may not be acceptable in another.

I've been looking for others that I can substitute for American (other than Cheddar). What I really need is a complete listing of what is lactose free.\nAnswer: Hard aged cheeses are generally much lower in lactose, but they aren't lactose free. They might just have a low enough amount that it won't upset your body. Aged sharp cheddar, aged swiss (gruyere, emmentaler), or dry jack might be good options. Another thing you might want to try are raw cheeses (available at many health food stores). A majority of people who are lactose intolerant are not bothered by raw dairy products. It has something to do with the pasteurization process changing the structure of the lactose. They're generally a little more expensive, but it might be worth a try if it means you'd be able to eat cheese.\n\nAnswer:",

Don't take it personally, they are under directives to ensure that you can receive medical care for any anticipated condition. \\n\\nYou can have a military physician reevaluate the condition and attest that only routine medical treatment is necessary. EFMP evaluators have been know to recommend EFMP status for things like asthma when you've only used an inhaler once for a cold. Mixups in medical records can also cause them to recommend EFMP status. I was told I had Hodgkin's (cancer) when someone else's exam sheet was placed in my record by mistake. Best bet, work with the your physician to negate any faulty reasoning on the EFMP evaluators part. \\n\\nThe EFMP is required by DoD and then usually managed on an installation level. To find out if an appeals process is available ask the EFMP office or patient liaison for the SOP or LOI that covers EFMP processing.\n\nAnswer:",

As stated I have no programming or webpublishing experience but don't mind spending some time on it as long as it doesn't take me months to get up & running. Any help would be very much appreciated.\nAnswer: The best and cheapest way is to sign up for a webhosting account and buy a domain name for your site. I personally recommend nfshost.com for it. They have PHP, CGI, MySQL and lots more pre-installed. Then you have to learn PHP and MySQL and write a CMS. Depending on your current status of knowledge in these subjects, it can take about a month or two to go online. Alternatively you may use some of the readymade CMS's available online for free.

It's a time for resolutions, a custom that goes back several millennia to the Babylonians, whose most popular one reportedly was to return borrowed farm implements. Nowadays, we're more likely to resolve to become better, skinnier, more fit, more patient, and smoke-free.\\n\\nParties, champagne and fireworks are common around the globe, but there are some more idiosyncratic customs as well. In Spain, 12 grapes are eaten during the last 12 seconds of the outgoing year (Peruvians eat 13). People who belong to polar bear clubs may indulge in a refreshing icy dip; the Coney Island Polar Bear Club of NYC has been doing this on New Year's Day since 1904. One Hogmanay custom popular in northeast Scotland is fireball swinging, which involves marching through the streets while twirling three-foot flaming balls on six-foot chains.\\n\\nOther places tend to drop things during the final countdown to midnight. The most famous, in Times Square, is a 1,070-pound, 6-foot Waterford crystal ball, but other choices in various US cities include a pine cone, a pickle, a pretzel, and a live opossum in a cage.\n\nAnswer:",

Swing is one part of the Java Foundation Classes (JFC). Swing includes graphical user interface (GUI) widgets such as text boxes, buttons, split-panes, and tables.\\n\\nSwing widgets provide more sophisticated GUI components than the earlier Abstract Windowing Toolkit. Since they are written in pure Java, they run the same on all platforms, unlike the AWT which is tied to the underlying platform's windowing system. Swing supports pluggable look and feel \u2013 not by using the native platform's facilities, but by roughly emulating them. This means you can get any supported look and feel on any platform. The disadvantage of lightweight components is possibly slower execution. The advantage is uniform behavior on all platforms.\n\nAnswer:",

In other words, God will look after the good Christians and Satan would be in charge of the rest.  Biblically, destruction was quick and 100% effective and final.  Why would God change his MO at the end?  I find this notion ridiculous without meaning to offend.\nAnswer: in the end, destruction is final but the consequences are eternal...it will not take long to destroy people who are evil..it is the evil soul (mind, will emotions)that is burned up.

The lesions may go away by themselves in a few months. Some may take years.\\n\\nHowever, if there are many areas, or ones that are cosmetically undesirable, there are several options. Your dermatologist may prescribe a steroid cream to apply, or inject steroids directly into the spot to help it disappear faster. Steroids can thin the skin and should be used according to your dermatologist\u2019s directions.\\n\\nPUVA is a special kind of ultraviolet light therapy. It is sometimes used for people with widespread disease under the close supervision of a dermatologist. The major side effect of PUVA is sunburn-type reactions. Other oral medications may be indicated. It is important to see a dermatologist and get the correct diagnosis and the appropriate therapy.\n\nAnswer:",

It has also been claimed that Audrey chose the last name Hepburn in honor of Katharine when she became an actress; however, the record shows that it was part of her family name for some time before she entered show business.\n\nAnswer:",

Normally these enzymes are not present in the blood, but they are released into the blood stream as cardiac (heart) cells die as a result of the heart attack.  The cell bursts when it dies and spills the enzymes into the blood stream.  So when these enzymes are present, it means there has been cardiac cell death, and therefore a heart attack.\n\nAnswer:",

Your love is the best thing you can give them. Just make sure that you make them feel accepted; sometimes, older people are afraid that younger people consider them as inferior and therefore tend to take everything more personally. So treat them like the normal people they are. Remember that they were once babies, once kids, once teenagers, once young adults... So don't try being all \"what can I do for you? Don't do that, you'll hurt yourself\" and stuff like many people tend to do. I know that comes from a good intention, but the truth is, a lot of times, grandparents don't want that from their grandchildren. Sometimes, they just want to be treated as friends, to feel young again... And yes there is a grandparent day. It's september 11, I think.\n\nAnswer:",

The gas cap was a total political move for publicity reasons.  It had no place being passed and shows that economics was far from the minds of our politicians who passed it.  \\nOur Gas Cap law based our gas prices on the market prices in LA, the Gulf Coast and NYC.  Unfortunately, we don't receive our petroleum supply from the same sources as the mainland.  We get the majority of our fuel from Asia, not Canada and the middle east like the mainland US.\\nThe Gas Cap Law controlled the wholesale price suppliers could sell to station, which then added on their charge to cover their operating expenses.  We were seeing gas prices in March and April raising $0.10 - $0.15 per week.  So, no the prices didn't reach a cap per se, because the cap was essentially limitless.  \\nYes, communist pricing models have no place in a free market society.

Fortunately it gets back above freezing often during the winter there so there typically aren't any long term affects.  \\n\\nThe biggest exception would be large power outages from bad ice storms (lines down from broken tree limbs) that have lasted over a week in some areas in the last few years.  That does not however happen that often.\n\nAnswer:",

Now, I see way too many punts go bouncing into the end zone or beyond. \\n\\nWhat's wrong with punters today? Can't they aim?\nAnswer: Booting the ball high in the air is substantially easier than aiming the ball at a point inside the 10 yard line.  Because it is much easier, there are fewer errors (such as kicking the ball out of bounds way too early).  I think that's why they pretty much stick to the high punts and let the coverage team do the rest of the work.\n\nAnswer:",

What to do?\nQuestion: It is not news that fifa has the absolute power that corrups absolutely.  We see it time and time again.  Brazil has the easiest schedule by far.  No other country has it easier.  Not only that the schedule was made to give Brazil more time to rest and to avoid powerhouses like Argentina, Germany, France, or Holland until the final instances.  Even then bad refereeing like tonight's shameful display by Horacio Elizondo on the game that \"gave\" Switzerland the pass to the next round.  Havelange and Blatter, Brazil and Switzerland once again.  The same old story.\nAnswer: I feel your frustration and I am in agreement with your assessment. Too many false red-cards have found their way from referees pockets into play during this cup -- which is completely opposite from the 2002 World Cup play (battles).   I like the game but these politics keep me from devoting too much time to following this sport professionally.\n\nAnswer:",

Male or female?\nAnswer: Well, males are more likely than women to get at least one orgasm, especially if the male controls proceedings.  Many women do not get to orgasm via penis in vagina sex.  Those women are thus (obviously??) likely to desire sex less than those men.\\n\\nIf women explore their sexuality, they can become multi - orgasmic, and can achieve massive prolonged orgasms, that might well exceed what men experience.  They might desire sex even more than the men involved.  I suspect that only a minority of women do this, however.\n\nAnswer:",

At high temperatures, Fe will fit into the orthoclase lattice.  As temperature drops, the lattice shrinks so that Fe no longer fits.  Fe diffuses out of the latice and accumulates along the planes between orthoclase crystal twins.  Along the way, it grabs O to produce Fe2O3.  If you look closely at pink granite, usually you will see that the pink grains are actually white and red striped.  Those grains are orthoclase crystals with exsolved hematite along twin planes.\\n\\nExsolution and diffusion of Fe from orthoclase can only occur at high temperature.  If the orthoclase cools too quickly for the Fe to diffuse out, it will remain in the orthoclase lattice, which will be distorted to accomodate the larger (larger than K) Fe ion.\\n\\nMaterial science is not boring.\n\nAnswer:",

While White had an exceptional game against Texas in the Rose Bowl, picking him first would be foolish.  You have to look at the whole enchilada when you pick up a RB.  Can my guy make catches? Do I have the offensive line to help make the holes needed for a PowerBack?  Well, the answer for the Texans is not yet.  Their offenisive line(while much improved) still is not good enough to provide the holes large enough for a straightforward power running game.  They need a RB like Bush who can not only run a finesse game, but catch a quick slant or out.  They need more options then just a power game.  The Jets would be more in line to pick up White w/ the 4th pick.  White's good, but not what the Texans need w/ their first pick.

Literally drawing our own blood with sterile materials and mixing them with the antigens to see what blood type we were. \\n\\nExcept that I couldn't get the blood to come out of the side of my finger. I stabbed a few more times and tried to squeeze a few drops out. But it wasn't enough to test. Then I felt really light headed and everyone told me I looked pale. The teacher even went so far as to tell me to put my head between my legs for a few minutes. So my question is what happened back there? Is this some weird survival instinct? Or do I have bad circulation in my hands? Or something else?\nAnswer: Nothing to worry about, you're just one of those types that faint at the sight of blood.  Just kidding, you were probably holding your breath the whole time you were sticking yourself.  Next time breath regularly and not too shallow.  By the way, I cowered out, my teacher had to stab my finger.  That was an adrenalin rush!\n\nAnswer:",

They could be in a transition in life: New city, inbetween jobs, lonely, just lost a loved one, just broke up with someone.  People are often lied to at first before they get in the group.  They get people to attend meetings under false pretenses.  The cult leaders put phobias against quitting in peoples minds.  Cults can provide an instant family and social approval for people.  If you really want to read more on this I would urge you to read combatting cult mind control by Stephen Hassan.  Also check out factnet.org and cult information websites.\n\nAnswer:",

The distortion is due to gravitational interaction with its larger and more massive neighbor M81. \\n\\nAnother, very similar example is at least mentioned in Messier's catalog, though it did not get a number on its own: NGC 5195, the companion of the Whirlpool galaxy M51, which had been discovered by Pierre M\u00e9chain. The only further irregular galaxies known to 1782 are the Large and the Small Magellanic Cloud; these are probably miniature disk galaxies in mutual gravitational interaction, and in interaction with our Milky Way.\n\nAnswer:",

A kinase is always an enzyme that phosphorylates something, that is, it adds a phosphate group. So creatine kinase is an enzyme that catalyses the phosphorylation of creatine to store phosphate, and the reverse reaction to transfer the phosphate back to ADP to form ATP.\n\nAnswer:",

As the temperature increases the light that it gives off changes (red to orange to bright orange).

If it is switched to 3 round burst and you pull the trigger and hold it, the gun only fires 3 shots with each pull of the trigger.\n\nAnswer:",

But I'm a medical student with final exams in a few days, and I need to know - some places I've read 21 weeks, others 22 weeks.\\n\\nThanks for your help.\nAnswer: For all terminations at gestational age of more than 21 weeks and 6 days,the method chosen should ensure that the fetus is born dead.  Inter-cardiac potassium chloride is the recommended method and the dose chosen should ensure that the fetal asystole has been achieved.  It should be confirmed by observing the fetal heart by an ultrasound scan for 5 minutes.  Additionally it is mandatory to confirm asystole by ultrasound scan 30-60 minutes AFTER the procedure and definitely before the patient leaves the hospital.\n\nAnswer:",

Thus the sandwich was born.  The real question is if everything invented is the best thing since sliced bread, what was the best thing before slcied bread?\n\nAnswer:",

Some doctors suggest you eat potato chips, popcorn and other like foods.  Some say that helps shorten the recovery time (which is only the \"sore throat\").  I do not know about this method as my doctor did not use this method. I found out about it years after my surgery.\\n\\nYour recovery time may be much shorter as I was 21 over 35 years ago.\\n\\nI hope all goes well for you.\n\nAnswer:",

Most of the books of the New testament were written long after the events occurred. For example, the book of Mark was written by someone with little knowledge of the geography of the Holy Land. Mark described Jesus going from Tyrian territory 'by way of Sidon to the Sea of Galilee through the territory of the Ten Towns' (Mark 7:31); this is similar to saying that one goes from London to Paris by way of Edinburgh and Rome.\nAnswer: Not only yes, but it makes you an intelligent one!!\\n\\nRemember this book was still written by men, not god himself.\n\nAnswer:",

If you have YAHOO email, there is a SPAM folder there too.  Nothing to do with a speed upgrade or a router/hub would effect your emails.  It could only be your provider filtering them, or an email setting on your email client.\n\nAnswer:",

Each fiber type requires a different approach. You are mainly concerned with type-2a and 2b. Type-2b has no endurance but is very strong so go heavey with 6 to 8 reps for a few weeks then switch over to type-2a meaning less weight from 15 to 20 reps, you can use your imagination and do inclined and or declined pyramid sets meaning you do four sets and add or subtract some weight each set. When adding weight your reps go down. You should never totally neglect your type-1 fibers, they are weak but have tons of endurance so maybe choose a weight were you can do anywhere from 50 to 100 reps with no burn but you only have to do this once or twice a month.\n\nAnswer:",

When you wake up but are completely paralyzed and it feels like someone or something is sitting on you keeping you from breathing or speaking.  You also get the strong sense of evil in the room. If so...explain....\nAnswer: sleep paralysis is a throwback from our hunter/gatherer days, caveman days, a long time ago. Back when we where not on top of the food chain and we were not the most powerful preditors. It is a defense mechanism that kept us safe at night. If we were asleep and moved, that would alert preditors out to get us. So our nervous system prevents the body from involuntarily moving while we are most vulnerable, while we are in a deep sleep. It is not supposed to continue when we are conscious but it does happen. If it happens while we are having a bad dream it seems logical to associate the feelings of terror and fear with evil but it is in our minds.\n\nAnswer:",

A player is allowed to lift his heel, but his toes and the ball of his foot must remain fully planted, so that they are only \"pivoting\" or swiveling around, without moving to another position on the floor.\\n\\nIn the NBA, the traveling rule is probably the rule most frequently violated without being called. Players on the move towards the basket frequently take \"extra steps\" without being called for it - but the relative freedom to violate the traveling rule is what has changed basketball from the old-time game of \"set shot\" shooting (standing still) to the more exciting modern game of \"driving\" and \"dunking\".\n\nAnswer:",

It can lead to lung and heart problems (hypertension and heart attacks).  Also, car accidents while dozing off at the wheel.  It is diagnosed with a 2 part sleep study.  The first to prove it occurs.  The second to prove that a CPAP machine reverses it.  Very expensive but worth it.  Sometimes weight reduction; sleeping on your side; or nasal/tonsil surgery can help.  Most often it is due to being overweight.\n\nAnswer:",

If you could solve that problem, then the result MIGHT depend on the yield of the weapon... but it would have to be a few million times stronger than today's strongest weapons, since the immense molten iron core of the earth handles pressures and forces far in excess of anything we will ever experience, and probably stronger than anything we could ever create in the next five thousand years. Nukes are only scary for fragile surface creatures in a relatively tiny area, not for fiery iron spheres that are the size of the moon.\n\nAnswer:",

By sterilizing the needle, it creates the illusion that the procedure is humane.  That in itself is silly -- killing a living creature is never humane, regardless of the fashion in which it's done.

They are grouped together because of the similarities between them. The three most common shared problems involve communication skills, motor skills, and social skills. Since there are no clear diagnostic boundaries separating these conditions it is sometimes difficult to distinguish one from the other for diagnostic purposes.\\n\\nAsperger's syndrome, autistic disorder, and childhood disintegrative disorder are four to five times more common in boys, and Rett's syndrome has been diagnosed primarily in girls. All of these disorders are rare.\n\nAnswer:",

Many people still heed Stephen Ambrose, George Harrison, and Alex Haley, all famous plagiarists.  Biden has permanently damaged his credibility, but he's carefuly spent time trying to restore it, and it appears that after twenty years he's pretty done a good job of it.\n\nAnswer:",

And hve u ever had it before?\nAnswer: Impetigo, a contagious skin infection that usually produces blisters or sores on the face and hands, is one of the most common skin infections among kids.\\n\\nIt is generally caused by one of two bacteria: group A streptococcus or staphylococcus aureus. Impetigo usually affects preschool and school-age children, especially in the summer months. A child may be more likely to develop impetigo if the skin has already been irritated or injured by other skin problems, such as eczema, poison ivy, insect bites, or a skin allergy to soap or makeup. \\n\\nGood hygiene can help prevent impetigo, which often develops when there is a sore or a rash that has been scratched repetitively (for example, poison ivy can get infected and turn into impetigo). Impetigo is typically treated with antibiotics.\\n\\nSigns and Symptoms\\nImpetigo may affect skin anywhere on the body but commonly occurs around the nose and mouth, hands, and forearms.\\n\\nWhen impetigo is caused by group A streptococcus, it begins as tiny blisters. These blisters eventually burst and leave small wet patches of red skin that may weep fluid. Gradually, a tan or yellowish-brown crust covers the affected area, making it look like it has been coated with honey or brown sugar.\\n\\nImpetigo that is caused by staphylococcus aureus triggers larger fluid-containing blisters that appear clear, then cloudy. These blisters are more likely to stay intact longer on the skin without bursting.\\n\\nContagiousness\\nImpetigo may itch and can be spread by scratching. Kids can spread the infection by scratching it and then touching other parts of the body.\\n\\nImpetigo is contagious and can spread to anyone who comes into contact with infected skin or other items, such as clothing, towels, and bed linens, that have been touched by infected skin.\\n\\nTreatment\\nWhen it just affects small areas of the skin, impetigo can usually be treated with antibiotic ointment. But if the infection has spread to many areas of the body, or the ointment isn't working, your child's doctor may prescribe an antibiotic pill or liquid.\\n\\nOnce antibiotic treatment begins, healing should start within a few days. It's important to make sure that your child takes the medication as the doctor has prescribed it. If that doesn't happen, a deeper skin infection or a blood infection could develop.\\n\\nWhile the infection is healing, gently wash the areas of infected skin with clean gauze and antiseptic soap every day. Soak any areas of crusted skin in warm soapy water to help remove the layers of crust (it is not necessary to completely remove all of it).\\n\\nTo keep your child from spreading impetigo to other parts of the body, your child's doctor or nurse will probably recommend covering infected areas of skin with gauze and tape or a loose plastic bandage. Keep your child's fingernails short and clean.\\n\\nPrevention\\nGood hygiene practices, such as regular hand washing, can help prevent impetigo. Use soap and water to clean your child's skin and be sure your child takes baths or showers regularly. Pay special attention to areas of the skin that have been injured, such as cuts, scrapes, bug bites, areas of eczema, and rashes caused by allergic reactions or poison ivy. Keep these areas clean and covered.\\n\\nMake sure that anyone in your family with impetigo keeps his or her fingernails cut short and that the impetigo sores are covered with gauze and tape.\\n\\nPrevent impetigo infection from spreading among family members by using antibacterial soap and making sure that each family member uses a separate towel. If necessary, substitute paper towels for cloth ones until the impetigo is gone. Separate the infected person's bed linens, towels, and clothing from those of other family members, and wash these items in hot water.\\n\\nWhen to Call Your Child's Doctor\\nCall your child's doctor if your child has signs of impetigo, especially if he or she has been exposed to a family member or classmate with t\n\nAnswer:",

Can he name her as a dependent?\nAnswer: An ex-spouse can still retain group medical coverage under COBRA for up to 36 months.  COBRA is a federal mandate for continuing health benefits when a qualifying event occurs such as divorce, for employers with 50 and over full and part time employees.  On the day the divorce becomes final, the employee should notify their employer and paperwork will then be sent to the ex-spouse notifying them of their right to continue medical benefits under the group's plan up to 36 months.  The paperwork must be completed and return within the specified time frame.  The monthly premium payment due is the full amount the insurance carrier charges the employer and the employer can add up to 2% of the cost to administer the paperwork.\n\nAnswer:",

If hair can grow from the mole well then it's not malignant. The only problem with tearing off moles is that they are very hard to stop bleeding, and that is why a doctor should do it by freezing it or removing it and stitching the skin.

At the moment I think it is around 50.000 but still it's nowhere near the amount of 10 or 20 years ago when groups would easily sell in the hundreds of thousands in  one week. However it isn't helped by downloads now counting towards the sales figures and singles are available to download the week before they are on physical release, so effectively their first week sales are split between the download and physical amounts over the two weeks.\n\nAnswer:",

Everyone else seems to play the Correct-As-Usual-King-Friday card, but Lady Elaine just breezes past security.  Are they related by blood or old schoolmates or what?\nAnswer: No, Lady Aberlin (the human) is King Friday's niece.  My guess is that they've known each other from childhood, and I want to say I've seen a flashback sequence of Friday's youth as a prince, but don't recall Elaine's appearance.

I hooked up with a guy that was very \"straight-acting\" but we only had oral. If we took it further would he be the top? Can I just assume this because we categorizes himself as a \"straight-acting\" guy? So am I but I'm versatile but I don't go around telling others I'm \"straight-acting\". Should I assume this?\nAnswer: I have noticed that a higher percentage of tops tend to be straight-acting, but no role preference for straight-acting gay guys in general. To try to make my explanation clearer, if you get a group of tops together you will most likely notice that a majority are straight-acting, but if you get a group of straight-acting gay guys together you most likely wouldn't find a difference in role preference.\n\nAnswer:",

Once you begin treatment, you will need to continue to see your dentist regularly in order to reverse gum disease.

We served Roast Beef and Chicken family style (trays were brought to the tables and people served themselves).  The guys wore silver vests and the girls wore apple red.  Our cake was white with a silver ribbon wrapped around it.  For our wedding favors I purchased 150 small silver bells with hearts on the top that also doubled as placecard holders.  We also had a friend bake us gingerbread men and woman and \"dressed\" them up with tuxes and dresses (using basic frosting).  The bells were perfect for those guests who are obsessed with having the bride and groom kiss every ten seconds!  I think it would be a great idea to do a christmas theme.

This internal pressure would be greater than the (very tiny) pressure outside the spacecraft.  And just like increasing the pressure inside a balloon by blowing into it causes it to expand, this increased pressure inside the spacecraft would, if there was a catastrophic failure of some kind, cause the space craft to explode rather than implode.  The exact opposite happens to submarines that are deep underwater.  If something happens to a submarine at depth, it will implode as the pressure of the water around it is greater than the pressure of the interior spaces.\n\nAnswer:",

Also, male nipples do serve a limited function in sexual arrousal.

It's true that Mars aka Ares was the god of war, but Athena was the goddess of victory, so another thing the philosophers and religious leaders did is make Athena highly masculine and even a woman-hater!\n\nAnswer:",

Four of the attackers later were convicted. \\n\\nTwo years later, the German Soccer Federation started the Daniel Nivel Foundation to research violence in soccer, help victims and develop preventive measures.\n\nAnswer:",

They send tanks to force a breakthrough wherever the infantry gets bogged down, they are often the tip of the spear for drives deep into enemy territory, and they can do more damage in 15 minutes than an infantry squad can do all day.

Adware is free and works fine so is spybot search and destroy.\\n\\nIf you wanna remove manually that is better than any programme but you have to be familiar with computers. Hijack this pulls everything out where a spyware can hide. Closing those holes will fix it. If you don't know computers then don't delete anything you don't know. If you download Hijackthis go ot their forums and they will ask you to send the list which is pulled by Hijackthis. They will help you to remove things step by step.\n\nAnswer:",

As positively identifying the occurrence of disease is usually based upon the presence of antibodies for that disease (especially with viral infections such as Herpes Simplex and HIV), this number is not significant if the specificity of the antibody is low.\n\nAnswer:",

At higher speeds, carbon fiber composites can be used, but radar waves can even be reflected from insulating materials (due to the change in dielectric constant between air and the material).  Many of these things reflect very poorly, though.  Coating the front of your car would not likely help with the local police radar -- however.\n\nAnswer:",

In the Philippines, you won't find a boxer who comes from a wealthy or a middle class family.  Who would risk getting beat up or even killed in the ring if you can afford to study or have a comfortable 8 to 5 job at an airconditioned office? Filipino boxers just like Manny dream of making it big someday through the only skill they know - fighting.  Pacquiao is just one of the very few who made it big.  Real big!\n\nAnswer:",

Does jacking off have any thing to do with it?\nQuestion: Why does some babies have problems or are mentally challenged? Does jacking off have any thing to do with it?\nAnswer: Good questions.  The reasons for babies having these problems are varied - one of the most common fixable would have to be the lack of folic acid in a pregnant woman's diet before getting pregnant & during the first 3 months of baby's development.  Um - jacking off doesn't to my knowledge have anything to do with the problems you mentioned.  Maybe you could look up specific conditions on your web browser or chat to your local nurse/doctor.  Good luck with finding your answers.  Cheers.\n\nAnswer:",
