Having a bad time with them. Thanks.\nAnswer: For the first one, let's first rewrite \"cscx secx\" as \"1 / (sinx cosx)\"\\n\\nSo we have:\\n\\ntanx - (1-2cos\u00b2x)/(sinx cosx) =\\n\\ntanx + (2cos\u00b2x - 1)/(sinx cosx) =\\n\\n(sinx/cosx) + (2cos\u00b2x - 1)/(sinx cosx) =\\n\\n(sin\u00b2x/sinx cosx) + (2cos\u00b2x - 1)/(sinx cosx) =\\n\\n(sin\u00b2x + cos\u00b2x + cos\u00b2x - 1)/(sinx cosx) =\\n\\n(1 + cos\u00b2x - 1)/(sinx cosx) =\\n\\ncos\u00b2x / (sinx cosx) =\\n\\ncosx/sinx = cotx\\n\\n~ ~ ~ ~ \\n\\nFor the second one, you started off in the right direction!  Let's do it here:\\n\\n( sinx + tanx ) / (cotx + cscx) = \\n\\n( sinx + sinx/cosx) / (cosx/sinx + 1/sinx) = \\n\\n( (sinxcosx + sinx) / cosx ) * ( sinx / (1 + cosx)) =\\n\\n-- now I'm just going to rearrange the terms a bit --\\n\\n( (sinxcosx + sinx) / (1 + cosx ) * ( sinx / cosx ) =\\n\\n( sinx(1+cosx) / (1+cosx) ) * sinx/cosx = \\n\\nsinx * tanx\\n\\n~ ~ ~ ~\\n\\nTips for solving -- experience, trial and error (sorry that's not too helpful!).   What I did for the second one was I started out like you did, then I rewrote where I wanted to end up (sinx tanx) as sinx * sinx/cosx to see if I could manipulate where I had gotten so far with my problem to where I wanted to go, and I was able to see how to connect the two.  Hope that helps somewhat.  I had a hard time with trig identities when I first learned them too.  They really just take lots and lots of practice.\\n\\n~ \u2665 ~\n\nAnswer:",

So you get:\\n\\nGamma(0) = 1\\nGamma(n) = n * Gamma(n-1)\\n\\nLook familiar?\\n\\nGamma(5) = 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 * 1 = 4!\\nand in general n! = Gamma(n + 1).\\n\\nSo this gives a way to compute x! when\\nx is not a nonnegative integer.  Compute\\nGamma(x + 1) and call it x!.  In this\\nmanner Euler extended the definition\\nof the factorial function to include\\nnon-integers.\n\nAnswer:",

The doctor's say there is nothing wrong with me but i am worried i might be unable to have a baby of my own.\nAnswer: I have had a miscarriage and i know the pain you are going through..sorry for your losses....\\n\\nWhat causes a miscarriage?\\nMost first-trimester miscarriages are caused by chance chromosomal errors that happen when the embryo is first forming. (Chromosomes are parts of a cell that carry a person's genes.) This is usually a one-time event that does not repeat itself in a woman's next pregnancy.2 Many miscarriages have no known cause. \\n\\nAfter the first 12 weeks of pregnancy, or when the fetal heartbeat is seen on ultrasound, miscarriage risk drops significantly.3 \\n\\nRisk factors that may increase chances of a miscarriage include: \\n\\nIncreasing age, especially at age 35 and older.\\nA history of two or more miscarriages.4\\nNonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) use (such as ibuprofen or naproxen) at the time of conception or during early pregnancy.5 \\nAlcohol or drug use during pregnancy. \\nCigarette smoking during pregnancy. \\nExposure to dangerous chemicals, such as benzene, arsenic, or formaldehyde, before or during pregnancy. \\nHeavy caffeine use during pregnancy. \\nCertain gynecological problems, such as uterine fibroids or other abnormalities of the uterus.\\nDisease or infection during pregnancy, including an autoimmune disease. \\nPhysical trauma. \\nAn immunologic cause\u2014a woman's immune system rejects the pregnancy\u2014which is a factor in a small number of miscarriages. \\nRecent research suggests that low folic acid levels may also increase the risk of miscarriage.6\\n\\nIt is unusual for a woman to have three or more miscarriages. Repeat miscarriages can be caused by an underlying medical problem. Known causes of repeat miscarriage include polycystic ovary syndrome, a blood-clotting disorder called antiphospholipid antibody syndrome, an abnormal uterus, and a chromosome abnormality in either parent.\\n\\nAfter a miscarriage, am I at risk for miscarrying again?\\nMiscarriage is usually a chance event, not a sign of an ongoing reproductive problem. If you have had one miscarriage, your chances for future successful pregnancies are good. Less than 1% of women have three or more miscarriages in a row (called recurrent miscarriages).8\\n\\nIf you have had three or more miscarriages, talk to your health professional about testing and treatment for a possible underlying cause\\nRisk factors for miscarriage\\nFactors that may increase your risk of miscarriage include:\\n\\nIncreasing age , especially at age 35 and older. \\nA history of recurrent miscarriage (three or more).\\nNonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) use (such as ibuprofen or naproxen) at the time of conception or during early pregnancy.5 \\nAlcohol use during pregnancy.3\\nCigarette smoking during pregnancy.9\\nCocaine use during pregnancy.9\\nExposure to dangerous chemicals, such as benzene, arsenic, or formaldehyde, before or during pregnancy. \\nHeavy caffeine use during pregnancy.\\nOther risk factors include having:\\n\\nA history of miscarriages on your mother's side of the family. \\nPolycystic ovary syndrome, which can cause ovulation problems, obesity, increased male hormone levels, and an increased risk of diabetes.\\nA poorly controlled ongoing disease (such as diabetes or an autoimmune disease).\\nCertain bacterial or viral infections during pregnancy. \\nA blood-clotting disorder such as antiphospholipid antibody syndrome.\\nProblems with the structure of the uterus (such as a T-shaped uterus). Between 12% and 15% of women who have recurrent miscarriages have problems with the structure of the uterus.3\\nA history of pregnancy with a birth defect. \\nA physical injury.\\nA chorionic villus sampling (CVS) or amniocentesis to test for birth defects or genetic problems. (CVS has a slightly higher risk of miscarriage [1 in 100] than amniocentesis [1 in 200].)10\\nThere are also known factors that do not increase the risk of miscarriage, such as exposure to computer monitors or electric blankets, sexual intercourse, and exercise.\\n\\n\\nCoping with a miscarr\n\nAnswer:",

That is the question.....?\nQuestion: My current boyfriend and I have been together for a little over two months now.  We are so in love (you can read my 360 to see whats up) and are completely happy with one another.  However, my family and him do not get along AT ALL!!!  He was on his way to moving to Portland when we met and decided to stay for me.  Since then we have only grown closer and truly feel this was \"meant to be\".  I have always lived here and my fam does also.  I have a son that is close to my family yet is now very close with my significant other.  He is talking about adopting him and we are his family.  He now wants to continue on his move to Portland yet wants my son and I to join him and start a family.  My family has not been supportive of any decision I make for myself, yet are very soft hearted and I know this will hurt them.  I love this man so really, should I allow anything to stop me from beginning on my dreams of my own family?\nAnswer: Now i'm not going to call you crazy but please listen up. This is not a world you should trust, meaning there are alot of cooks out there who is willing and able to take advantage of your love for them. Why don't you wait about a year, have patience, and see where God wants to take you. You have a soul responsibility to your son, and taking him on a dangerous journey is not very wise. You going alone is not wise in itself so putting your son a risk for something terrible to happen is even worse. Love conquers all but as it says in Pr 14:8 The wisdom of the prudent is to understand his way: but the folly of FOOLS is deceit. Don't be decieved into something that might not be meant to be and might not be God's will for you and your sons life. Seek the wisdom and instruction of the Lord if you believe. You have only known him for two months and you are quickly and foolishly running off to another state with him. Is this because you have a dream for your son to have a father and you to have family, well let it be done right not foolishly. Take the step to saying I will go with you but not now. Wait about a year or even two, and see if he still loves you then, see what kind of person he really is. Then  see after that if he will marry you. If so then you know you are on your way to having that family but my best advice to you is seek the kingdom of God first and all of these things shall be added unto you. Make sure you are equally yoked, meaning you must have the same beliefs in God and are both saved. If that's not the case than it will not work, trust  me on this! Do you know for sure what he believes as far as God and salvation, marriage? Do you know for sure what he does for a living? have you done a back ground check on him? Give me his name and I can do it for you email me privately. It's for your and your son's saftey. Do yo know his history and full personality? Do you know his family and have you talked to any of them? Is he controlling? Do you know what he likes and don't like? Do you know his dating history? Most of these you probably believe you know or don't know yet but are serious things you need to consider when leaving your safety zone and your family. They might be on to something so talk to them. Parents often times can sense danger of there child. please email me. I am very concerned for you saftey and your sons. \\nsincerely yours, Godly Woman\n\nAnswer:",

Simplify h(x) by multiplying top and bottom of the fraction by e^x; then \\nh(x) = [e^(2x) - 1]/[e^(2x) + 1].  (Note careful use of brackets.)  Clearly, as x tends to minus infinity, e^(2x) tends to zero, so h(x) tends to just -1/1, i.e. -1.\\n\\nLive long and prosper.\n\nAnswer:",

The big picture is quite wide, so let's focus on a particular property of classical thermodynamics that is challenged by the chaotic behavior of certain systems: the equipartition of energy.\\nClassical thermodynamics tells us that, providing enough time, a system goes to equipartition, i.e. its energy is apportioned in equal parts along all the degrees of freedom. It is well known that the equipartition law has been disproved by quantum mechanics, but until some years ago it was believed a necessary consequence of classical mechanics.\\nThe news is that the recent studies (including my little contribution) have shown that there are certain systems for which, under given conditions, neither classical mechanics prescribe the equipartition of energy.\\nA class of such systems is constituted by the nonlinear Hamiltonian lattices, that is, N-dimensional spring/mass chains with nonlinear springs. To make it simple, consider that some solid gasses have their atoms stuffed in crystals that can be modeled as such lattices.\\nThese systems are classified as chaotic (or also stochastic) for mathematical reasons too complex to be explained here.\\nSuppose you freeze Helium at the point that it solidifies. Then you have such a crystal. Its degrees of freedom are the harmonic modes of oscillation of the crystal (just like the harmonic sounds in a guitar string). From the equipartition law one should expect that, after waiting some time, all harmonics go to the same energy. But this is not the case: most energy remains instead concentrated in the lower harmonics. The effect is stronger as the temperature decreases.\\nObviously these results are mainly obtained thanks to computer simulations, because the involved equations have no analytic solution.\\nSurprisingly, some of these results match with the prediction of quantum mechanics. This is clearly a debated issue but it suggests anyway that the \"old-fashioned\" classical mechanics has still something to say in modern physics!\\n\\nLater addition (in relation to the \"Additional Details\" above): yes, of course I'm speaking of deterministic chaos here, in the mathematical sense (thought it was obvious).\n\nAnswer:",

You are labeling yourself as a racist even if you don't mean to.  Everyone who sees you can see that you are white.  Why do you neeed a tattoo to say it again?  What you need to think about is why do you need to have the tatoo say that to feel that you are defining yourself to someone.  We all see races but if you see people for who they really are then you may not need that tattoo.  \\n\\nSince you said, \"I just like being who I am,\" Why do you like about being white?  What did you do besides be born white to merit being proud about it?  Think about that.  Try to be proud of what you have accomplished, not what you have been born with, because that is no accomplishment at all and nothing to be proud of.  The wiser you become the more you will see this.  \\n\\nAlso, go rent a fantastic movie that has a bit about racist tattoos: American History X.  You will like it.\\n\\nTake care\\n\\nTake care\n\nAnswer:",

Yet, for the sake of debate, which of the following choices proves most logical:\\n\\n1) All in nature existed eternally\\n\\n2) Something in the natural existance is the source of all that ever existed in the natural, (including by evolution)\\n\\n3) Something beyond nature, and with NO intelligence, is the source of all in nature\\n\\n4) Something beyond nature, and with intelligence, is the source of all in nature\\n\\n5) Some other conclusion, (although no other conclusion can be formed without some sort of redundancy).\\n\\nPlease, explain your logic and reason for your conclusion. Logic and reasoning is key.\\n\\nThank you for all and any answers.\nAnswer: An interesting question.  \\n\\n#1 would seem at first glance to be automatically false, as everyone will agree that there is evidence that there was a time when the things we see today in nature, did not exist.  But to get a little deeper, what if these things are the natural products of natural laws that have always existed?  E.g. what if our universe is just one of an endless series of universes that appear, unfold under natural laws that have been in existence for eternity, and then disappear, only to get reborn again as a new universe?\\n\\n#2 is the *goal* of a scientific explanation.  I.e. to see how much we can explain by the discovery of natural laws.  Science has no way of knowing if such an explanation will always be possible, but it has to try.  And so far we have done remarkably well ... almost everything we see in nature can be explained in terms of the operation of natural laws.  And natural laws can often be shown to derivable from simpler natural laws.  (E.g., that's why physicists are on a quest to unify the four forces of physics ... so that all laws of atomic physics can be derived from a single law.)  However, scientists will always be faced with the question of where these simplest of natural laws came from.  And they may have to settle for the answer \"they seem to have always been there\", which brings us back to #1.\\n\\n#3, and #4 need more definitions to distinguish them.  What do you mean by phrases like \"beyond nature\", and \"intelligence.\"  \\n\\nHOWEVER, despite being a died-in-the-wool evolutionist, I lean towards #4, (an intelligent, supernatural origin for all things in nature) but not with in the same sense as Intelligent Design.  I *don't* believe some intelligence designed every cell membrane, every flagellum, every eyeball, every bird, bat, or insect wing, every endochrine cycle, etc.  Evolution provides a far more satisfactory explanation for all those things based on such simple natural laws as the law of natural selection.  \\n\\nBut I do wonder where that force of natural selection, as a natural law, came from.   I believe it will be shown to be derivable from simpler laws of chemistry and thermodynamics, which can be derived from even simpler laws of physics.  But ultimately, we will still be faced with wondering where those primary laws of physics came from.\n\nAnswer:",

We may not understand it at the time, but there is a reason. You have to try and be happy first...as far as the past goes, you can not change that but you can change the future. When you wake up in the morning, say to yourself It is going to be glorious day! Thank God for letting you wake up in the first place.....You have all the reasons in the world to live you have 3 sons who I am sure love you. You are probably feeling this way because you are going through a divorce, but Honey, I have been through 2 myself and I have found someone who treats me the way I should be treated.....it has taken me 35 years, but hey.....Good things come to those who wait.....Continue to see your therapist and look for a job, they are out there.\\nI use to be on depression meds. and I have been off of them now for 10 years...granted, I Still have my moods, but they are not what they use to be, and when I get in one, I try to sing, or read a few funny jokes or talk to a friend or family member. Life can be rewarding......it only takes a little bit of time. It is time for you to stop worrying about what everybody else thinks and worry about what you want.........suicide is not the answer......\n\nAnswer:",

It is only a BAD HABIT that could be broken with a simple Executive Order. \\n\\nAccording to estimates, some 200,000 so-called anchor babies are born in the United States every year. \\nOnce a mother has birthed a child on American soil, she can then seek to obtain citizenship for herself on the strength of the family-reunification laws. \\nEven before this happens, she is very hard to deport, as the mother of an American, and the full panoply of welfare benefits is available to her, \\nas is affirmative action if she is a member of a racial minority. \\nA group of attorneys and immigration experts are trying to do something about the problem. \\nCraig Nelsen, director of Friends of Immigration Law Enforcement: \"The situation we have today is absurd,There is a huge and growing industry in Asia that arranges tourist visas for pregnant women so they can fly to the United States and give birth to an American. This was not the intent of the Fourteenth Amendment; it makes a mockery of citizenship.\"\\n\\nThe key to undoing the current misinterpretation of the Fourteenth Amendment is this odd phrase\\n \\n\"AND SUBJECT TO THE JURISDICTION THEREOF.\"\\n \\nThe whole problem is caused by the fact that the meaning of this phrase, which was clear to anyone versed in legal language in 1868, \\nhas slipped with changes in usage. Fortunately, there is a large group of court precedents that make clear what the phrase actually means: \\n\\nThe Fourteenth Amendment EXCLUDES the children of aliens. (The Slaughterhouse Cases (83 U.S. 36 (1873)) \\n\\nThe Fourteenth Amendment draws a distinction between the children of aliens and children of citizens. (Minor v. Happersett (88 U.S. 162 (1874)) \\nThe phrase \"subject to the jurisdiction\" requires \"direct and immediate allegiance\" to the United States, not just physical presence. \\n(Elk v. Wilkins 112 U.S. 94 (1884)) \\n\\nThere is NO automatic birthright citizenship in a particular case. (Wong Kim Ark Case, 169 U.S. 649 (1898)) \\n\\nThe Supreme Court has NEVER confirmed birthright citizenship for the children of illegal aliens, temporary workers, and tourists. \\n(Plyler v. Doe, 457 U.S. 202, 211 n.10 (1982)) \\n\\nThere are other cases referring to minor details of the question.\\n\\nthe so-called 14th amendment was never properly ratified either. \\nIn the case of Dyett v. Turner, 439 P.2d 266, 270 (1968), \\nthe Utah Supreme Court recited numerous historical facts proving, \\nbeyond any shadow of a doubt, that the so-called 14th amendment was likewise a major fraud upon the American People.\\n\\nThose facts, in many cases, were Acts of the several State Legislatures voting for or against that proposal to amend the U.S. Constitution. \\nThe Supreme Law Library has a collection of references detailing this major fraud.\\n\\nThe U.S. Constitution requires that constitutional amendments be ratified by three-fourths of the several States.\\n As such, their Acts are governed by the Full Faith and Credit Clause in the U.S. Constitution. See Article IV, Section 1.\\n\\nJudging by the sheer amount of litigation its various sections have generated, \\nparticularly Section 1, the so-called 14th amendment is one of the worst pieces of legislation ever written in American history. \\nThe phrase \u201csubject to the jurisdiction of the United States\u201d is properly understood to mean \u201csubject to the municipal jurisdiction of Congress.\u201d \\n\\nFor this one reason alone, the Congressional Resolution proposing the so-called 14th amendment is provably vague and t\n\nAnswer:",

So the four corners are (-5, 10)....etc. After I rotate it say 30 degrees. What are the four new corner values? What is the general formula to calculate if there is one.\nAnswer: The general rotation transform function is to multiply its coordinate in complex coordination by the transform function of R(teta)=cos(teta)+i*sin(teta) where teta is the transform (rotation) angle and i is the imaginary unique value.\\nSuppose coordination of your point is (x,y); so the transformed point (x',y') would be:\\nx'+i*y'=(x+i*y)*\\n        [cos(teta)+i*sin(teta)]\\n       =[x*cos(teta)-y*sin(teta)]+\\n        i*[x*sin(teta)+y*cos(teta)]\\ntherefore:\\nx'=x*cos(teta)-y*sin(teta)\\ny'=x*sin(teta)+y*cos(teta)\\n\\nin your example, the point (-5,10) after rotation of 30 degrees counterclockwise will be transformed to:\\nx'=-5*cos(30)-10*sin(30)~ -9.33\\ny'=-5*sin(30)+10*cos(30)~ +6.16\n\nAnswer:",

A graph of lnKsp against 1/T is plotted.  The slope is (-delta H degrees)/(R) and the intercept will be (delta S degrees)/ (delta G).  Delta G degrees can then be determined at any temperature of  interest.  \\n\\nThe graph of my information gives me a slope of -5348.5 and a y-intercept of 12.614.  \\n\\nHow is the graph used to evaluate delta H?\nAnswer: R is the gas constant (= 8.31 J/mol*K).  The value should be with the list of constants in your book.\\n\\nOk Nic, you seem to be a bit confused on this issue so lets go back and start from scratch.\\n\\nFirst you obtained you values for T and K (experimentally or otherwise).  MAKE SURE YOU CONVERT YOUR TEMP VALUES TO KELVIN.  It's important for the units of the constant (R) are in Kelvin.  So then you calculate 1/T and lnK and plot the values for each set to generate your graph.\\n\\nYou calculate slope by taking two of your points (x1,y1) and (x2,y2).  From the data you added, let's say we'll use your first (0.002976, -3.079) and last points (0.003165, -4.225).\\n\\nslope= [-4.225- (-3.079)]/[0.003165-0.002976]= -6063.49 kelvin\\n\\nSince slope = -delta H/R\\nThen -delta H = slope * R\\nSo -delta H = -6063.49kelvin * 8.31 J/molkelvin\\nAnd -delta H= -50387.62 J/mol\\nRemoving the negatives from both sides\\nDelta H= 50387.62 J/mol\\n\\nFor the second part of the question, use one (x,y) experimental point to find the y-intercept.  They don't want you to determine it from your plot, they want you to calculate the exact value.\\n\\nThe equation of a line is y=mx+b where \"m\" is the slope and \"b\" is the intercept.  So take another experimental point from readings (ie 0.003012, -3.751) and calculate the intercept by using the slope value calculated above.\\n\\nIf y=mx+b, then b= y-mx\\nPlugging in the values\\nb= -3.751 - (-6063.49kelvin * 0.003012/kelvin)\\nb= -3.751 - (-18.26)\\nb= 14.51\\n\\nTo calculate delta S for that same point (for that's what is requested), first you have to calculate delta G for that point.  Use the  following equation;\\n\\ndelta G = -RTlnK\\n\\nYou know the value for R (8.31 J/molkelvin), and you have the temp value and lnK value for that point for it was expermientally determined\\n\\n1/T= 0.003012/kelvin so T=332.01 kelvin\\nlnK= -3.751\\n\\nSo delta G= -8.31 J/molkelvin * 332.01 kelvin * -3.751\\nand delta G = 10349.02 J/mol\\n\\nYou can then calculate delta S for\\nintercept = delta S/ delta G (given in your original data)\\n\\nTherefore delta S = intercept * delta G\\nSo delta S = 14.51 * 10349.02 J/mol = 150164.28 J/mol\\n\\nHope this clarifies things.\n\nAnswer:",

He came home from a hard day of running around to find he had nothing in his room but a pillow and one cover.  Since he paid no bills, he wasn't allowed to use my electric, my air conditioning, his stereo, NOTHING.  He was allowed to sleep in his room from 10:00 P.M. until 8:00 A.M.  The rest of the time he was not allowed in the house.  He was allowed to eat breakfast, get a drink of water and use the head before he left.  When he was able to pay me $5.oo per week, he regained his room 24 hrs.  When He was able to pay me $5.00 more per week. he got back his stereo and T.V.  He took three weeks to tell me he had a job (at MacDonald's).  Before the month was over he was able tp pay me $20.00 per week to have his normal room back.  I put all the money in an account for him and 6 months later  he had a down payment on a car.  Now he has a better job (construction), a girl friend he can afford and a car with insurance.  I believe that he hated me at first, but now, every once in a while, he says, Poppa, thanks for making me get up off my butt.  Things are so much more enjoyable.\n\nAnswer:",

How is  then a father of a child, determined  by a DNA\nQuestion: This would mean they have the same DNA and this would go down from generation to generation all having same DNA.\nAnswer: its true that no two person can have the same DNA...\\n\\nbut the determination of parental disputes is not done by matching the DNA but by matching the small sequences present on the DNA known as Genes...\\n\\na collection of a set of genes on DNA is called chromosome..\\n\\nsince a child has 50% characteristics of both the father and the mother, he has the same set up of genes in his/her chromosomes.. on the chromosomes, there are many sites which are exclusive to that set of gene and chromosome and are known as VNTR's VARIABLE NUMBER TANDEM REPEATS...\\n\\nthese sites are very unique, they differ from person to person but remain in the same place in a lineage.... this very property of the genes on the chromosome containing DNA accounts for the determination of parental disputes..\\n\\n\\nfor eg:   suppose in gene A, of Chromosome 1 ur mom has 5 VNTR alternatively and ur dad had 3...\\n\\nso if u a guy then u'll have the same 3 VNTR's on the gene containing chromosome..\\n\\nas simple as that..\\n\\nhope u got the point...\n\nAnswer:",

And that's probably hard to believe since you two are so close. Men like kissing and fooling around with women and they don't really care who the woman is or about her feelings. Maybe he is lonely and hadn't been with a girl in a long time and you were just there so he decided to fool around with you with out considering your feelings. I'm sorry but he doesn't seem like a good friend. I'd try to find other friends and spend more time with them. It doesn't mean you have to ignore him completely. But he obviously doesn't care about your feelings and you should hang out with  other people who will. \\n\\nAnother possibility is that he might have been confused and wanted to kiss you to see if he might have had any feelings for you as more than a friend. Then he realized you two can only be friends. \\n\\nHowever, I think that the first might be more correct. He was not being respectful or considerate. Even if he wanted to try going out with you, he shouldn't have fingered you. He could have asked you out on a date but not go so far. I think he was just being plain selfish and took advantage of you. \\n\\nI would advise you to forget him and find another guy. But if you still want to try to get closer to him and get into a boy friend-girl friend  relationship, I would advise you to give him some time, but always treat him well, but don't really hint or talk about romance. Just show him you care by your actions. If after a while, it still didn't work, ask him out and say that you would really appreciate it if he could at least give you a chance. Tell him you think that you two would get a long great and that you want a chance because it's worth getting to know a girl who loves him so much. But don't let anything too intimate happen between you two on the first dates. He should respect that. Good luck! I hope everything works out for you!\n\nAnswer:",

The supermarket is to be rectangular in shape with three solid brick walls and a very fancy all-glass front.  If glass cost 1.88 times as much as the brick wall per linear foot, what should be the dimensions of the building so that the cost of material for the walls is a minimum?\nAnswer: Thinking about this intuitively, if the cost for all 4 walls was the same, what design would give you the smallest perimeter of a rectangle where the product of the sides is 14,400?  That would be a square.  Now, you can see that because that one wall has a greater cost, you want to make that wall's length less (which means making the corresponding back wall less, and the sides grow longer).  But at some point we lose so much efficiency (because the side walls get SO much longer that the total price goes up, that we start paying more. We need to figure out at what point the cost of the front + back walls equals the cost of the side walls. \\n\\nLet's develop a couple of formulas.\\n\\nlet c = the cost/linear foot, x = length of one wall (we will arbitrarily assume that x and it's partner x' will contain the glass), y = length of an adjacent wall.\\n\\nThen total cost = c*x + 1.88*c*x +2*c*y or simply 2.88*c*x + 2*c*y\\n\\nThe total square footage of 14400 is equal to x * y:  x * y = 14400\\n\\nSince we already observed that the greatest economy is found when the cost of the front and back walls (2.88*c*x) is equal to the cost of the side walls (2*c*y) we can solve this equation:\\n\\n2.88*c*x = 2*c*y; or 1.44*x = y\\n\\nsubstitute for y in: x * y = 14400 yields:\\n\\nx * 1.44*x = 14400, which simplifies as:\\n\\n1.44*(x^2) = 14400, which when solved yields:\\n\\nx = 100 feet\\n\\nThis implies that y = 144 feet.\n\nAnswer:",

The word hoplite (Greek \u1f41\u03c0\u03bb\u1f77\u03c4\u03b7\u03c2, hoplit\u0113s) derives from hoplon (\u1f45\u03c0\u03bb\u03bf\u03bd, plural hopla, \u1f45\u03c0\u03bb\u03b1) meaning an item of armour or equiment and consequently the entire equipment of the hoplite (but not specifically the circular shield, which is sometimes incorrectly referred to as a hoplon, though it was in fact called an aspis). These soldiers probably first appeared in the late 8th century BC. These were a citizen-militia, and so were armed as spearmen, which are relatively easy to equip and maintain; mainly they represented the middle class, who could afford the cost of the armaments. Almost all the famous men of ancient Greece, even the philosophers and playwrights, fought as hoplites at some point in their lives.\\n\\nHow did they fight?\\nSince the hoplites were a militia force and did not receive permanent wages, campaigns were short and mainly confined to the summer. Armies marched directly to their target. There the defenders could hide behind city walls, in which case the attackers generally had to content themselves with ravaging the countryside as siegecraft was undeveloped, or meet them on the field. Battles were usually set piece and intended to be decisive. Both forces lined up on a level field, usually in a rough phalanx formation around eight ranks deep (though this varied). Other troops were less important; cavalry generally protected the flanks, when present at all, and both light infantry and missile troops were negligible.\\n\\nWith what did they fight?\\nHoplites generally armed themselves immediately before battle, since the equipment was so heavy. Each man provided his own gear so it was fairly non-uniform, and often friendly troops would fail to recognise one another. A hoplite typically had a breastplate, a bronze helmet with cheekplates, as well as greaves and other armor, plus a bowl-shaped wooden shield called an aspis which was around 1 metre across. The primary weapon was a spear, around 2.7 metres in length; as this frequently broke upon charging and was unwieldy for close combat, hoplites also carried a smaller 60 cm thrusting sword called a xiphos. The total cost of the hoplon was roughly equivalent to a middle-sized car in our time.\n\nAnswer:",

For example: New shoes $120 12 months = $10 a month.\\n\\nYou will have in your budget items that are considered 'fixed' items - like rent/mortgage, utilities, gas/transportation, etc.\\n\\nLine your fixed items up, then your goals under that, next to all of them will be your monthly figure. Once you have a total, you subtract that from your net(in pocket) pay.\\n\\nYou will either have money left over OR you will not have enough - this is when you need to rework your budget - for example: New shoes $120 2 years (24 months) = $5 and so on.\\n\\nI have used new shoes, but of course it can be anything that is important to YOU.\\n\\nPlease consider, as part of your budget, money for emergencies. Six to twelve months of FIXED living expenses (or somewhere in between ) is a good number. This (emergency fund) may take you a while, but it will be well worth it when you have an emergency.\\n\\nIf you have a preadsheet program, Xcel or any other, this will make the calculations easier - as it will recalculate as you change items.\\n\\nGood luck!\n\nAnswer:",

This knowledge is important for IRRIGATION, FERTILIZATION, and CULTIVATION. The amount and location of roots may be influenced by soil characteristics.\\n\\n2)Stems are generally upright and above ground, easy to locate and identify. However, many stems grow below ground or are ground-hugging. A modified stem is recognizable because it includes buds and sometimes leaves.  \\nBuds and shoots generally develop on stems.\\nThey carry nutrients and water from the roots to the other parts of the plant.\\nIn some cases, stems also store food. \\n\\n3)Nodes are places on the stem where leaves are attached and buds form.\\nRoots often form at nodes of creeping plants and when cuttings are taken for propagation.\\nInternodes are the segments of the stem between nodes.\\n \\nThe quality and amount of available light and temperature affect the length of the internode. The distance between nodes can be long or short. This distance reflects growing conditions. Plants grown under poor light conditions may be spindly, with very long, thin, and weak internodes. \\n\\n\\n4)Leaves are lateral outgrowths from the stem, most commonly flat, broad, and green. This maximizes their function of absorbing sunlight and transforming it into food. Leaves have evolved into many shapes and sizes, reflecting adaptations to the environment. Leaves generally consist of a stalk or PETIOLE and a blade or LAMINA. In simple leaves the lamina is in one piece. In compound leaves several pieces of lamina are joined to one petiole. \\n\\n\\n5)Buds are undeveloped shoots and flowers. Buds are classified terminal or lateral. Another term for terminal is apical. Terminal buds can be identified by their location at the tip of a stem. Lateral buds are located at the sides of the stem.\\n\\nFlower buds are normally larger than VEGETATIVE buds. Cabbage and head lettuce are examples of very large terminal buds. Brussels sprouts are edible lateral buds. Broccoli is an example of edible flower buds.  \\n\\n\\n6)The function of flowers is sexual reproduction through the production of seeds. A flower that has both male and female parts is called a perfect flower. Flowers that have only male or only female parts are called imperfect. A complete flower has four kinds of structure. Sometimes petals or stamens may be converted to nectaries so that it appears that there are other structures present. If a flower lacks one kind of structure it is said to be incomplete. The structures are arranged from the outermost inwards: The calyx is often green (but may be colored) and made up of two or more sepals  \\n    The corolla is often colored (but may be green) and made up of petals  \\n    The stamens are the male portion of the flower. Each consists of an anther, containing pollen supported by a stalk or filament  \\n    Pistils (there may only be one) are the female part. Each includes one or more ovaries where seeds will form, a stigma that captures and holds pollen, and a style that supports the stigma on the ovary. \\n\\n\\n7)A fruit is a ripened ovary or group of ovaries containing the seeds. It may include adjacent tissue that fuses with the ovary. Once the ovary is fertilized, the seeds develop and the ovary enlarges forming the mature fruit.  simple fruit forms from the ripening of the ovary of a single pistil. Examples include peanuts, sunflower seeds, grain (corn, barley, rice), acorns, walnuts, tomatoes, grapes, eggplants, citrus fruits, and apples.  \\n    Aggregate fruit form from flowers with several simple pistils, such as raspberries and strawberries.  \\n    Multiple fruit forms from a cluster of several flowers. A fruit is produced by each flower and these fruits merge into a multiple\n\nAnswer:",

Or time for good behavior?  You would have to be more specific and state whether the offense was charged at the city/county level, the state level, or the federal level.  \\n\\nBased on my understanding of the so-called justice system, a judge may grant a defendant with credit for the time (i.e. each day) served in a facility after being charged.  Each judge, however, is different, some will stipulate that they don't count that time before a charge, or before being sentenced, so be sure to get a good look at the sentencing transcript.  Time that is not counted toward a sentence is considered to be \"dead time.\"  Good time, is often a percentage taken off for good behavior, working, rehabilitation, employment, etc - unless you had the balls to go federal.  Then, you can look forward to doing all your time unless you get involved in some kind of incentive program.  It all just depends on the sentencing judge and what he has to say.  \\n\\nWill parole/probation be offered?  I like to think of parole as the opportunity to finish your time out in the real world while being 'babysa't by the government or 'court services.'  You're still doing time, but you're not behind the walls.  I hope this information helps you.  \\n\\nGood luck.\n\nAnswer:",

I love him deeply an wish I could be with him but this can not be. No he isnt married!!! The timing just isnt right for us. He makes it hard to let go, so I need to know what I should do when he trys to reach me? I will be ok if he doesnt.

The angular speed of wheel A is increased from rest at a constant rate of 1.6 rad/sec2. Find the time needed for wheel C to reach an angular speed of 100 rev/min, assuming the belt does not slip. (Hint: If the belt does not slip, the linear speeds at the two rims must be equal.)\nAnswer: let RA and RC be the angular speed of wheel A and C respectively\\nthen linear speed of belt B = RA*rA = RC*rC \\nhence RA= RC * rC/rA = RC 25/10 = 2.5 RC\\n\\nWhen C reach 100 rev/min\\nthen A reach 2.5 100 = 250 rev/min\\nRA = RAo + a*t = 0 + 1.6 t rad / sec\\nRA = 1.6 t /(2*pi) = 1.6 t /6.28 =0.2548 t rev/sec =15.288 t rev/min\\n15.288 t = 250\\nt = 250/15.288 = 16.35  seconds\n\nAnswer:",

They managed to find out the truth coz they wanted to kno the truth and any one who finds out the real truth about islam will never b a non-Muslim any more.\\n\\nbefore any comments check these videos out, if u dont have the player or somin, download it, do what ever and watch these  videos.\\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUufwp0F8Rw \\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMGyCr0LPh0\\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36Glj_FAGcw\\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_k62TYdR10g&NR\\n\\nand we got a site where u c some miracles of ALLAH\\nhttp://www.geocities.com/islamicmiracles/index.htm\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nplz plz check it out and do comment on them\\nALLAH U AKBER(GOD IS GREAT)\nAnswer: 1. I am a Christian and do not believe that Islam is equal to terrorism. \\n\\n2.  I am a Christian who aloso does not believe that Islam is the religon from God. In fact I do not believe in Religon. Religon blinds and enslaves people. Truth awakens people and sets them free.  I've studied Islam, and this is just my personal view, but it didn't speak to me.   Much of it seems like a mixture between Judaism and Christianity.  I just think Christianity is more true, if not the truth.  \\n\\nAs for 1000s of people converting to Islam everyday, well 1000s of people convert to Christianity everyday, but you and I know that there is a diffrence between one who calls themselves a Muslim and One who truly is a Muslim. Just like there is a diffrence betweeen one Who calls himself a Christian and one who is truly a Christian.  \\n\\nG-flux\\nGod bless\n\nAnswer:",

Einstien come up with the equation E=mc2? how will it be ralative in dev. of a-bomb/fusion?\nAnswer: The E=mc^2 equations come from Einstein's theory of Special Relativity. Special Relativity concerns the laws of motion and observed properties when objects are travelling very close to the speed of light.\\n\\nSpecial relativity starts with two premises: the speed of light is constant for all observers, and the laws of physics are the same for all observers. However, observed properties are not necessarily the same.\\n\\nSay I flew past the Earth in a space ship travelling 99% the speed of light. To me, the space ship is normal, but the Earth would look squished, rotated, and blue with everyone moving slowly. To you, however, Earth would look normal, but the space ship would be squished, rotated, blue and with everyone moving very slowly. (This gets resolved if the space ship turns around - breaking the symmetry - to come home, and results in the famous Twins \"Paradox.\")\\n\\nIn describing the laws of motion in the context of special relativity Einstein derived that E = mc^2 -- in other words that mass has a \"rest energy.\"\\n\\nIf an electron and an anti-matter electron (known as the positron) bump into each other then their is total energy conversion. The mass of two electrons is converted into energy.\\n\\nIn a fission or fusion bomb the the atomic process (breaking apart a heavy atom, or fusing some light atoms) results in a  much smaller conversion of mass to energy. But still a lot compared with normal explosives.\n\nAnswer:",

A= -7, B =4\\nb. A= 3, B = 7\\nc. A = 7, B = 4\\nd. A = 4, B = 7\nAnswer: Partial fraction decomposition is simply the undoing of the process of adding two unlike fractions. For example, one would add 1/3 to 2/5 by saying 1/3 + 2/5 = 5/(5*3) + (3*2)/(5*3) = [5 + (3*2)] / (5*3) = 11/15.\\nPartial fraction decomposition is noting that in the fraction 11/15, the denominator is the product 5*3 and finding the numbers A and B such that 11/15 = A/3 + B/5. From the above, we know that A = 1 and B = 2. \\nIn the case of a variable denominator that is a polynomial, we know from algebra that all polynomials can be factored (over the real numbers) into a product of monomials, binomials, and quadratics. These forms are convenient because they yield easy integrations (if you're not up to calculus yet).\\nIn your case, we have (11x - 2)/(x^2 + x - 6) = (11x - 2)/[(x + 3)*(x - 2)].\\nWe thus want to find A and B such that we can write this fraction in the simpler form (for integration) A/(x + 3) + B/(x - 2).\\nTo find A and B, we evaluate the sum above to get [A(x - 2) + B(x + 3)]/[(x + 3)(x - 2)]. Since the numerator must be 11x - 2, we have Ax - 2A + Bx + 3B = 11x - 2. \\nGrouping like terms, we get (A + B)x + (3B - 2A) = 11x + (-2).\\nThus, A + B = 11 and 3B - 2A = -2. Solving the first equation for A, we get A = 11 - B. Plugging this value of A into the second equation gives us 3B - 2(11 - B) = -2. Solving for B, we get B = 4. Thus, A = 11 - 4 = 7.\\nOnce you get used to this, you will find that it is a lot quicker than manually plugging in all 4 multiple choice values.\n\nAnswer:",

Plz help by showing the work.\nAnswer: Since it is a direct variation we can use the formula\\n\\ny = k x\\n\\nSince we are given the ordered pair (2,4) we know y=4 when x=2. Plugging these values into the formula gives us\\n\\n4 = k(2)\\n\\nTo solve for k we divide both sides by 2 which gives us\\n\\nk = 2.\\n\\nIt would also be correct to set up the variation to be\\n\\nx = k y\\n\\nIn this case, we do the same procedures to find k. Plug in the known values for x and y to get that k = 1/2. Unless you are told which one to solve for either are correct. If you are given a multiple choice test I would think that only one could be a possible answer, unless you are first given the variation equation.\n\nAnswer:",

You sound like the kind of girl that will have sex with any one and every one who is good looking or popular. That will get you a name around school that you don\u2019t want and also don\u2019t want your parents hearing about. When he said it\u2019s too easy he meant you are to easy, free with your body. Easy girls turn off some guys, they want a challenge someone who has an ounce of respect for themselves. He may be a player but doesn\u2019t want to play with you, you are no challenge just another notch on someone\u2019s belt.  Sex with multiple partners is what causes STD\u2019s of which there are many and the worse is AIDS.

So, an isolated incedent should not be held against someone. \\nDo I think anyone should drive with a baby on their lap absolutly NOT....the child should have been in a car seat in the back. \\nAs for the head fracture, I don't know anything about that or how it happened so I can't say whether it was due to her neglect or abuse.  Accidents do happen....even when the child has great parents. \\nNone of us are in a postion to sit back and place judgement on anyone. As parents we are responsible for taking care of, providing for and loving our children. Some parents just don't have a good balance between them. A parent can love their child with all of their heart and not be equiped to take care of them or support them properly, a parent can provide for and take care of their child and yet still not show enough or adequate love for their child. \\nParenting is not an easy job....and no matter what you do as a parent there is always someone that will find fault in something you do or in choices you make. \\nAll we can do is be the best parent we can be....even if it means taking parenting classes to help us obtain the skills needed. \\nMore often than not, the families that have child protective services involved are good people trying to do the best they can....flat out abuse just for the sake of abuse is not the norm.\\nPassing judgement and talking bad about it is not going to solve the problem....\\nIf a child is being abused or neglected in any way, someone needs to step in and be sure that the child gets into a home where it will be properly cared for on all levels. The natural parent needs to do things to become a better parent ... prosecution and ridicule by the public is not going to teach the person how to be a better parent.  She needs to work on that and others need to stand up and offer some help and support.... that will help far more than us putting them down.\n\nAnswer:",

Are Jewish people still waiting for a Messiah?\nQuestion: Or have they given up hope that a messiah will ever come?  Christians believe that Jesus Christ is the son of God and the Messiah, yet Jewish people reject him.  If Jewish people do believe that a messiah will come, how will they recognize him?  I am a Christian who has always been curious about this; I honestly mean no disrespect to your faith.  Are there any Jewish people who can shed some light?  Thank you, I appreciate it.\nAnswer: first off all American their is a list that one must do to be called the messiah. and yes Jews are still waiting for the first person to complete that check list. \\n\\nhere it is -- it is detialed and long so bear with\\n\\nTHE MESSIAH ACCORDING TO JUDAISM\\nOne of the basic premises upon which Christianity rests is that Jesus was the Messiah predicted in the Jewish Bible. Judaism has always rejected this belief. Since the goal of \"Hebrew Christian\" missionaries is to convince Jews that Jesus did in fact fulfill the requirements of the promised Messiah, it is necessary to examine the Jewish understanding of the Messiah to understand why such claims are simply not true.\\n\\nTHE HEBREW ROOTS OF THE WORD \"MESSIAH\"\\n\\nThe Hebrew word for \"Messiah\" is \"Moshiach --.\" The literal and proper translation of this word is \"anointed,\" which refers to a ritual of anointing and consecrating someone or some-thing with oil. (I Samuel 10:1-2) It is used throughout the Jewish Bible in reference to a wide variety of individuals and objects; for example, a Jewish king (I Kings 1:39), Jewish priests (Leviticus 4:3), prophets (Isaiah 61:1), the Jewish Temple and its utensils (Exodus 40:9-11), unleavened bread (Numbers 6:15), and a non-Jewish king (Cyrus king of Persia, Isaiah 45:1).\\n\\nTHE CRITERIA TO BE FULFILLED BY THE JEWISH MESSIAH\\n\\nIn an accurate translation of the Jewish Scriptures, the word \"Moshiach\" is never translated as \"Messiah,\" but as \"anointed.\"1Nevertheless, Judaism has always maintained a fundamental belief in a Messianic figure. Since the concept of a Messiah is one that was given by G-d to the Jews, Jewish tradition is best qualified to describe and recognize the expected Messiah. This tradition has its foundation in numerous biblical references, many of which are cited below. Judaism understands the Messiah to be a human being (with no connotation of deity or divinity) who will bring about certain changes in the world and who must fulfill certain specific criteria before being acknowledged as the Messiah.\\n\\nThese specific criteria are as follows:\\n\\n1) He must be Jewish. (Deuteronomy 17:15, Numbers 24:17)\\n\\n2) He must be a member of the tribe of Judah (Genesis 49:10) and a direct male descendent of both King David (I Chronicles 17:11, Psalm 89:29-38, Jeremiah 33:17, II Samuel 7:12-16) and King Solomon. (I Chronicles 22:10, II Chronicles 7:18)\\n\\n3) He must gather the Jewish people from exile and return them to Israel. (Isaiah 27:12-13, Isaiah 11:12)\\n\\n4) He must rebuild the Jewish Temple in Jerusalem. (Micah 4:1)\\n\\n5) He must bring world peace. (Isaiah 2:4, Isaiah 11:6, Micah 4:3)\\n\\n6) He must influence the entire world to acknowledge and serve one G-d. (Isaiah 11:9, Isaiah 40:5, Zephaniah 3:9)\\n\\nAll of these criteria for the Messiah are best stated in the book of Ezekiel chapter 37:24-28: \\n\\n\"And My servant David will be a king over them, and they will all have one shepherd, and they will walk in My ordinances, and keep My statutes, and observe them, and they shall live on the land that I gave to Jacob My servant...and I will make a covenant of peace with them; it will be an everlasting covenant and I will set my sanctuary in their midst forever and My dwelling place shall be with them, and I will be their G-d and they will be My people. And the nations will know that I am the Lord who sanctifies Israel, when My sanctuary is in their midst forever.\" \\n\\nIf an individual fails to fulfill even one of these conditions, he cannot be the Messiah.\\n\\nWHY JESUS COULD NOT HAVE BEEN THE JEWISH MESSIAH\\n\\nA careful analysis of these criteria shows us that, although Jesus was Jewish, he did not fulfill any of the other criteria. An examination of the contradictory accounts of Jesus' genealogy demonstrates a number of difficulties with the fulfillment of the second criterion. Specifically, the New Testament claims that Jesus did not have a phy\n\nAnswer:",

And even then, the FDA's guidelines are overly cautious. The FDA has issued no consumption advice about the amount of fish that's safe for older kids, teens, men, post-menopausal women, and women who don't plan to become pregnant.\\nIn the FDA's own words, its mercury guideline \"was established to limit consumers' methyl mercury exposure to levels 10 times lower than the lowest levels associated with adverse effects.\" So even if a pregnant woman consumed twice as much mercury as the FDA's recommended limit, she would still be protected by a 500-percent cushion.\\nSo determine which category you are and eat accordingly. \\nThere is tuna consumption calculator but rough estimate is that it is safe to eat 2 ounces for 3 ponds of you weigh.\\nexample you weight 120 lbs \\nmultiply it by 2 and divided by 3 = 80 ounces of tuna per week almost 2 lbs.\n\nAnswer:",
