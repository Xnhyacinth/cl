There is no egg in eggplant, nor ham in hamburger; neither apple nor pine in pineapple.  English muffins weren't invented in England or French fries in France.  Sweetmeats are candies while sweetbreads, which aren't sweet, are meat.  We take English for granted.  But if we explore its paradoxes, we find that quicksand can work slowly, boxing rings are square and a guinea pig is neither from Guinea nor is it a pig.\\n\\nAnd why is it that writers write but fingers don't fing, grocers don't groce and hammers don't ham?  If the plural of tooth is teeth, why isn't the plural of booth, beeth?  One goose, 2 geese.  So one moose, 2 meese?  One index, 2 indices? Doesn't it seem crazy that you can make amends but not one amend?  If you have a bunch of odds and ends and get rid of all but one of them, what do you call it?\\n\\nIf teachers taught, why didn't preachers praught?  If a vegetarian eats vegetables, what does a humanitarian eat? Sometimes I think all the English speakers should be committed to an asylum for the verbally insane. In what language do people recite at a play and play at a recital?  Ship by truck and send cargo by ship?  Have noses that run and feet that smell?\\n\\nHow can a slim chance and a fat chance be the same, while a wise man and a wise guy are opposites?  You have to marvel at the unique lunacy of a language in which your house can burn up as it burns down, in which you fill in a form by filling it out and in which, an alarm goes off by going on.\\n\\nEnglish was invented by people, not computers, and it reflects the creativity of the human race, which, of course, is not a race at all.  That is why, when the stars are out, they are visible, but when the lights are out, they are invisible.\\n\\nPS. - Why doesn't \"Buick\" rhyme with \"quick\"\\n\\n\\nYou lovers of the English language might enjoy this . . . \\n\\n\\n\\nThere is a two-letter word that perhaps has more meanings than any other two-letter word, and that is \"UP.\" \\n\\nIt's easy to understand UP, meaning toward the sky or at the top of the list, but when we awaken in the morning, why do we wake UP?  At a meeting, why does a topic come UP? Why do we speak UP and why are the officers UP for election and why is it UP to the secretary to write UP a report? \\n\\nWe call UP our friends.  And we use it to brighten UP a room, polish UP the silver, we warm UP the leftovers and clean UP the kitchen. We lock UP the house and some guys fix UP the old car.  At other times the little word has real special meaning.  People stir UP trouble, line UP for tickets, work UP an appetite, and think UP excuses.

Its national significance dates back to June 20, 1782, when the Continental Congress officially adopted the current design for the Great Seal of the United States including a bald eagle grasping arrows and an olive branch with its talons. Some states had earlier adopted the bird as a symbol; for example New York State did so in 1778.\\n\\nIn 1784, after the end of the Revolutionary War, Benjamin Franklin wrote a famous letter to his daughter from Paris criticizing the choice and suggesting the Wild Turkey as an alternative:\\n\\nFor my own part I wish the Bald Eagle had not been chosen the Representative of our Country. He is a Bird of bad moral character. He does not get his Living honestly. You may have seen him perched on some dead Tree near the River, where, too lazy to fish for himself, he watches the Labour of the Fishing Hawk; and when that diligent Bird has at length taken a Fish, and is bearing it to his Nest for the Support of his Mate and young Ones, the Bald Eagle pursues him and takes it from him. \\nWith all this Injustice, he is never in good Case but like those among Men who live by Sharping & Robbing he is generally poor and often very lousy. Besides he is a rank Coward: The little King Bird not bigger than a Sparrow attacks him boldly and drives him out of the District. He is therefore by no means a proper Emblem for the brave and honest Cincinnati of America who have driven all the King birds from our Country . . . \\nI am on this account not displeased that the Figure is not known as a Bald Eagle, but looks more like a Turkey. For the Truth the Turkey is in Comparison a much more respectable Bird, and withal a true original Native of America . . . He is besides, though a little vain & silly, a Bird of Courage, and would not hesitate to attack a Grenadier of the British Guards who should presume to invade his Farm Yard with a red Coat on. \\nDespite Franklin's objections the Bald Eagle remained the emblem of the United States. Today it appears on many official seals in addition to the back of 25 cent coin.\n\nAnswer:",

He looked dirty and unkept.\\n\\nThe customer turned back and entered the barber shop again and he said to the barber: \"You know what? Barbers do not exist.\"\\n\\n\"How can you say that?\" asked the surprised barber.   \"I am here, and I am a barber. And I just worked on you!\" \\n\\n\"No!\" the customer exclaimed. \"Barbers don't exist because if they did, there would be no people with dirty long hair and untrimmed beards, like that man outside.\"\\n\\n\"Ah, but barbers DO exist! That's what happens when people do not come to me.\"\\n\\n\"Exactly!\" affirmed the customer. \"That's the point! God, too, DOES exist! That's what happens when people do not go to Him and don't look to Him for help. That's why there's so much pain and suffering in the world.\"\\n\\nMay God guide u in the right way,ameen\n\nAnswer:",

Take your wife and go home.\" \\n\\nFinally, it was the woman's turn. She was given the same instructions, to kill her husband. She took the gun and went into the room. Shots were heard, \\none shot after another. They heard screaming, crashing, banging on the walls. \\n\\nAfter a few minutes, all was quiet. The door opened slowly and there stood the woman.

While the parasite is found throughout the world, more than 60 million people in the United States may be infected with the Toxoplasma parasite. Of those who are infected, very few have symptoms because a healthy person's immune system usually keeps the parasite from causing illness. However, pregnant women and individuals who have compromised immune systems should be cautious; for them, a Toxoplasma infection could cause serious health problems.\\n\\n\\nHow do people get toxoplasmosis?\\n\\nA Toxoplasma infection occurs by:\\n\\n    * Accidentally swallowing cat feces from a Toxoplasma-infected cat that is shedding the organism in its feces. This might happen if you were to accidentally touch your hands to your mouth after gardening, cleaning a cat's litter box, or touching anything that has come into contact with cat feces. Eating contaminated raw or partly cooked meat, especially pork, lamb, or venison; by touching your hands to your mouth after handling undercooked meat.\\n    * Contaminating food with knives, utensils, cutting boards and other foods that have had contact with raw meat.\\n    * Drinking water contaminated with Toxoplasma.\\n    * Receiving an infected organ transplant or blood transfusion, though this is rare. \\n\\n\\nWhat are the symptoms of toxoplasmosis?\\n\\nSymptoms of the infection vary.\\n\\n    * Most people who become infected with Toxoplasma are not aware of it.\\n    * Some people who have toxoplasmosis may feel as if they have the \"flu\" with swollen lymph glands or muscle aches and pains that last for a month or more.\\n    * Severe toxoplasmosis, causing damage to the brain, eyes, or other organs, can develop from an acute Toxoplasma infection or one that had occurred earlier in life and is now reactivated. Severe cases are more likely in individuals who have weak immune systems, though occasionally, even persons with healthy immune systems may experience eye damage from toxoplasmosis.\\n    * Most infants who are infected while still in the womb have no symptoms at birth, but they may develop symptoms later in life. A small percentage of infected newborns have serious eye or brain damage at birth. \\n\\n\\nWho is at risk for developing severe toxoplasmosis?\\n\\nPeople who are most likely to develop severe toxoplasmosis include:\\n\\n    * Infants born to mothers who became infected with Toxoplasma for the first time during or just before pregnancy.\\n    * Persons with severely weakened immune systems, such as individuals with HIV/AIDS, those taking certain types of chemotherapy, and those who have recently received an organ transplant. \\n\\n\\nWhat should I do if I think I am at risk for severe toxoplasmosis?\\n\\nIf you are planning to become pregnant, your health care provider may test you for Toxoplasma. If the test is positive it means you have already been infected sometime in your life. There usually is little need to worry about passing the infection to your baby. If the test is negative, take necessary precautions to avoid infection (See below).\\n\\nIf you are already pregnant, you and your health care provider should discuss your risk for toxoplasmosis. Your health care provider may order a blood sample for testing.\\n\\nIf you have a weakened immune system, ask your doctor about having your blood tested for Toxopla\n\nAnswer:",

It is the scripture given from Allah through the angel Gabriel. Does the Qur'an teach Jihad? Absolutely yes. As you will see in the following quotes from the Qur'an, Holy War is definitely taught and encouraged.\\n\\n\"Truly Allah loves those who fight in His Cause in battle array, as if they were a solid cemented structure\" (Surah 61:4).\\n\\n\"Fight in the cause of Allah those who fight you but do not transgress limits... 191And slay them wherever ye catch them. and turn them out from where they have turned you out; for persecution is worse than slaughter; But fight them not at the sacred Mosque unless they (first) fight you there; But if they fight you, slay them. Such is the reward of those who reject faith. 192 But if they cease, Allah is oft-forgiving, Most Merciful. 193And fight them on until there is no more persecution. And the religion becomes Allah's. But if they cease, Let there be no hostility except to those who practice oppression\" (The Qur'an, Surah 2:190-193).\\n\\n\"O ye who believe! what is the matter with you, that, when ye are asked to go forth in the cause of Allah, ye cling heavily to the earth? Do ye prefer the life of this world to the Hereafter? But little is the comfort of this life, as compared with the Hereafter. Unless ye go forth, He will punish you with a grievous penalty, and put others in your place; but Him ye would not harm in the least. For Allah hath power over all things. Unless ye go forth, He will punish you with a grievous penalty, and put others in your place; but Him ye would not harm in the least. For Allah hath power over all things,\" (Surah 9:38-39).\\n\\nSee also Surah 4:74-76; 61:10-12.\nAnswer: No where in the Bible did Jesus command his disciples to kill in the name of Jesus Christ. \\nYou are right though, the Quran encourages it's followers to fight nonbelievers...........\\n\\nFight those who (1) believe not in Allah, (2) nor in the last day, (3) nor forbid that which has been forbidden by Allah and his messenger(Muhammad) (4) And those who acknowledge not the religion of truth (ie. Islam) among the people of the scripture (Jews and Christians), until they pay the Jizyah [tax] with willing submission, and feel themselves subdued.\\n-Surah 9:29\\n\\nWhen Muslims use the sword, they are practicing what the Quran teaches. \\nThe evils done by Christians were by name only. They disobeyed the word of Christ. Because of this, you will see no difference between Muslims who kill, and the Christians who kill. The difference is in whether or not they are following the example of their leader.\\n\\nThe fact is that every person who participated in the Crusades was going against the teachings of Christ. However, when Muslims overthrow a Government by force, they are following both the teachings and example of Muhammad.\\n\\n\\nTo Taimur, let me ask you, what would happen to you if you lived in a Muslim country and tryed to convert to Christianity?\n\nAnswer:",

The doctor's say there is nothing wrong with me but i am worried i might be unable to have a baby of my own.\nAnswer: I have had a miscarriage and i know the pain you are going through..sorry for your losses....\\n\\nWhat causes a miscarriage?\\nMost first-trimester miscarriages are caused by chance chromosomal errors that happen when the embryo is first forming. (Chromosomes are parts of a cell that carry a person's genes.) This is usually a one-time event that does not repeat itself in a woman's next pregnancy.2 Many miscarriages have no known cause. \\n\\nAfter the first 12 weeks of pregnancy, or when the fetal heartbeat is seen on ultrasound, miscarriage risk drops significantly.3 \\n\\nRisk factors that may increase chances of a miscarriage include: \\n\\nIncreasing age, especially at age 35 and older.\\nA history of two or more miscarriages.4\\nNonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) use (such as ibuprofen or naproxen) at the time of conception or during early pregnancy.5 \\nAlcohol or drug use during pregnancy. \\nCigarette smoking during pregnancy. \\nExposure to dangerous chemicals, such as benzene, arsenic, or formaldehyde, before or during pregnancy. \\nHeavy caffeine use during pregnancy. \\nCertain gynecological problems, such as uterine fibroids or other abnormalities of the uterus.\\nDisease or infection during pregnancy, including an autoimmune disease. \\nPhysical trauma. \\nAn immunologic cause\u2014a woman's immune system rejects the pregnancy\u2014which is a factor in a small number of miscarriages. \\nRecent research suggests that low folic acid levels may also increase the risk of miscarriage.6\\n\\nIt is unusual for a woman to have three or more miscarriages. Repeat miscarriages can be caused by an underlying medical problem. Known causes of repeat miscarriage include polycystic ovary syndrome, a blood-clotting disorder called antiphospholipid antibody syndrome, an abnormal uterus, and a chromosome abnormality in either parent.\\n\\nAfter a miscarriage, am I at risk for miscarrying again?\\nMiscarriage is usually a chance event, not a sign of an ongoing reproductive problem. If you have had one miscarriage, your chances for future successful pregnancies are good. Less than 1% of women have three or more miscarriages in a row (called recurrent miscarriages).8\\n\\nIf you have had three or more miscarriages, talk to your health professional about testing and treatment for a possible underlying cause\\nRisk factors for miscarriage\\nFactors that may increase your risk of miscarriage include:\\n\\nIncreasing age , especially at age 35 and older. \\nA history of recurrent miscarriage (three or more).\\nNonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) use (such as ibuprofen or naproxen) at the time of conception or during early pregnancy.5 \\nAlcohol use during pregnancy.3\\nCigarette smoking during pregnancy.9\\nCocaine use during pregnancy.9\\nExposure to dangerous chemicals, such as benzene, arsenic, or formaldehyde, before or during pregnancy. \\nHeavy caffeine use during pregnancy.\\nOther risk factors include having:\\n\\nA history of miscarriages on your mother's side of the family. \\nPolycystic ovary syndrome, which can cause ovulation problems, obesity, increased male hormone levels, and an increased risk of diabetes.\\nA poorly controlled ongoing disease (such as diabetes or an autoimmune disease).\\nCertain bacterial or viral infections during pregnancy. \\nA blood-clotting disorder such as antiphospholipid antibody syndrome.\\nProblems with the structure of the uterus (such as a T-shaped uterus). Between 12% and 15% of women who have recurrent miscarriages have problems with the structure of the uterus.3\\nA history of pregnancy with a birth defect. \\nA physical injury.\\nA chorionic villus sampling (CVS) or amniocentesis to test for birth defects or genetic problems. (CVS has a slightly higher risk of miscarriage [1 in 100] than amniocentesis [1 in 200].)10\\nThere are also known factors that do not increase the risk of miscarriage, such as exposure to computer monitors or electric blankets, sexual intercourse, and exercise.\\n\\n\\nCoping with a miscarr\n\nAnswer:",

In his Prior Analytics, Aristotle defines syllogism as: \"a discourse in which, certain things having been supposed, something different from the things supposed results of necessity because these things are so.\" (24b18\u201320) Despite this very general definition, however, he limits himself almost entirely to categorical syllogisms\\n\\nA syllogism consists of three parts: a major premise, a minor premise, and a conclusion. Each of the premises has one term in common with the conclusion: in the case of the major premise this is the major term, or predicate of the conclusion; in the case of the minor premise it is the minor term, the subject of the conclusion. For example:\\n\\nMajor premise: All men are mortal. \\nMinor premise: Socrates is a man. \\nConclusion: Socrates is mortal. \\n\"Being mortal\" is the major term and \"Socrates\" the minor term; the connection between them is made by the middle term, in this case \"being a man\". Here the major premises is general and the minor particular, but this needn't be the case. For example:\\n\\nMajor premise: All mortal things die. \\nMinor premise: All men are mortal. \\nConclusion: All men die. \\nHere, the major term is \"die\", the minor term is \"all men\", and the middle term is \"being mortal\".\n\nAnswer:",

I mean the Solar System changed now and some people still answers with 9 planets. For example: There could be a science test and if it asks the question \"How many planets are there?\" they would still answer 9 planets. I think that's unfair.\nAnswer: The International Astronomical Union decided that Pluto was no longer a planet. The reason is that while Pluto is round, orbits the sun, and has three moons, it has not cleared (via gravity) its own orbit of debris.  Instead, they decided to classify it as a \"dwarf planet\".\\n\\nSee the details below.\\n\\nRESOLUTION 5A\\nThe IAU therefore resolves that \"planets\" and other bodies in our Solar System, except satellites, be defined into three distinct categories in the following way:\\n\\n(1) A \"planet\" [footnote 1] is a celestial body that (a) is in orbit around the Sun, (b) has sufficient mass for its self-gravity to overcome rigid body forces so that it assumes a hydrostatic equilibrium (nearly round) shape, and (c) has cleared the neighbourhood around its orbit.\\n\\n(2) A \"dwarf planet\" is a celestial body that (a) is in orbit around the Sun, (b) has sufficient mass for its self-gravity to overcome rigid body forces so that it assumes a hydrostatic equilibrium (nearly round) shape [footnote 2] , (c) has not cleared the neighbourhood around its orbit, and (d) is not a satellite.\\n\\n(3) All other objects [footnote 3] except satellites orbiting the Sun shall be referred to collectively as \"Small Solar-System Bodies\".\\n\\n\\nFootnote 1: The eight \"planets\" are: Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune.\\n\\nFootnote 2: An IAU process will be established to assign borderline objects into either dwarf planet and other categories.\\n\\nFootnote 3: These currently include most of the Solar System asteroids, most Trans-Neptunian Objects (TNOs), comets, and other small bodies.\\n\\nRESOLUTION 6A\\nThe IAU further resolves:\\n\\nPluto is a \"dwarf planet\" by the above definition and is recognized as the prototype of a new category of trans-Neptunian objects.\n\nAnswer:",

Our deepest fear is that we are powerful beyond measure. It is our light, not our darkness, that most frightens us. We ask ourselves, who am I to be brilliant, gorgeous, talented, fabulous? Actually, who are you not to be? You are a child of God. Your playing small doesn\u2019t serve the world. There\u2019s nothing enlightened about shrinking so that other people won\u2019t feel insecure around you. We are all meant to shine, as children do. We were born to make manifest the glory of God that is within us. It\u2019s not just in some of us; it\u2019s in everyone. And as we let our own light shine, we unconsciously give other people permission to do the same....\\n\\n\\ni am afraid that i will twist out of control in my life, and it will be so out-of-control, there's nothing i will be able to do but stand aside and watch it whirl away, scooping me up on the way and taking me away from my loved ones.\n\nAnswer:",

The defect allows blood to flow from one atrium to the other, usually from the left side to the right side. This causes extra blood flow:\\n\\nIn the right atrium \\nIn the right ventricle \\nTo the lungs \\n\\n\\nFigure A shows the normal anatomy and blood flow of the interior of the heart. Figure B shows a heart with an atrial septal defect, which allows oxygen-rich blood from the left atrium to mix with oxygen-poor blood from the right atrium. \\n\\nIn a normal heart, oxygen-poor (blue) blood returns from the body to the right atrium. From the right atrium, the blue blood flows to the right ventricle\u2014one of the two lower chambers of the heart\u2014and is pumped to the lungs to pick up oxygen. After traveling through the lungs, the blood is now oxygen-rich and red. The red blood returns from the lungs to the left atrium and goes to the left ventricle, where it is pumped to the body. The right and left sides of the heart are normally completely separated by the septum. The septum keeps the blue blood from mixing with the red blood. The later section \"How the Heart Works\" explains the process in greater detail.\\n\\nASD is the second most common congenital heart defect.\\n\\nMore than 3,000 babies are born with ASD each year in the United States. \\nASD occurs twice as often in girls as in boys. \\nEffects of Atrial Septal Defect\\nOver time, the extra blood flow to the right side of the heart and the lungs can cause:\\n\\nEnlargement of the right atrium and the right ventricle. \\nRight heart overload. The right side of the heart has to work harder to pump extra blood to the lungs, especially as resistance in the pulmonary (PULL-mun-ary) artery increases. Over time, the heart may become overworked, and function may become impaired. This is exceedingly rare with modern methods of diagnosis and treatment. \\nIrregular heartbeats or rhythms (arrhythmias). Extra blood flowing into the right atrium through the ASD can cause the atrium to stretch and enlarge. When this occurs, a fast heartbeat can develop with symptoms such as dizziness, fainting, or chest discomfort. \\nStroke. Occasionally a blood clot in a vein or in the right side of the heart can pass through the ASD and enter the blood stream, where it can block an artery supplying the brain and cause a stroke. \\nPulmonary artery hypertension. This is when high blood pressure exists in the arteries that carry blood to the lungs. The extra blood being pumped to the lungs can increase the pressure in the pulmonary arteries. Over time, high pressure can damage the arteries and the small blood vessels in the lungs. They thicken and become stiff, making it harder for blood to flow through them (pulmonary vascular disease). \\nUsually, most of these effects don\u2019t show up until adulthood, often around age 30 or later. They are rare in infants and children.\\n\\nCharacteristics\\nAn ASD is classified by its size and location.\\n\\nSize\\nThe size of an ASD can range from small to large.\\n\\nMost small defects close on their own as the heart grows during childhood. They usually allow only a small amount of blood to flow between the atria. \\nModerate to large defects are much less likely to close on their own. They allow two or more times the normal amount of blood to flow through the right side of the heart. Large holes sometimes cause symptoms during infancy or childhood. \\nLocation\\nThree major types of ASD exist, based on the location of the defect on the septum:\\n\\nSecundum. This defect is in the middle of the septum. It is the most common form of ASD. About 7 out of every 10 babies born with ASD have this type. This type often closes on its own, unless it is large. \\nPrimum.\n\nAnswer:",

Timothy 2;12, I do not permit a Woman to teach or to have authority over a Man; she must be silent.\nAnswer: The testimonies of manhood and womenhood are often neglected by todays so called \"church\". Rarely do men know that males are supposed to be a living testimony of Christ. Just as rarely do women know that females are to be a living testimony of the redeemed Church of Christ. Such truth is portrayed in the indisputable writings of the Apostle Paul in Ephesians:\\n\\nEphesians 5:\\n21 Submitting yourselves one to another in the fear of God.\\n22 Wives, submit yourselves unto your own husbands, as unto the Lord.\\n23 For the husband is the head of the wife, even as Christ is the head of the church: and he is the saviour of the body.\\n24 Therefore as the church is subject unto Christ, so let the wives be to their own husbands in every thing.\\n25 Husbands, love your wives, even as Christ also loved the church, and gave himself for it;\\n26 That he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of water by the word,\\n27 That he might present it to himself a glorious church, not having spot, or wrinkle, or any such thing; but that it should be holy and without blemish.\\n28 So ought men to love their wives as their own bodies. He that loveth his wife loveth himself.\\n29 For no man ever yet hated his own flesh; but nourisheth and cherisheth it, even as the Lord the church:\\n30 For we are members of his body, of his flesh, and of his bones.\\n\\nVerse 21 bluntly clearifies that we are to care for each other, and submit to the needs of one another. Paul further explains that the relationship of husband and wife is the same as that of Christ and His Church. Therefore, let the man love and take care of his wife as Christ does the Church, and let the wife honour and obey her husband as the Church does Christ.\\n\\nThis is an often neglected topic in today's modern teaching, because it isn't politically correct. However, Christ nor His Apostles were politically correct.  As Peter states:\\n\\nACTS 5:29 Then Peter and the [other] apostles answered and said, We ought to obey God rather than men.\\n\\nPolitics, including feminism and political correctness have no place in the Church of Christ. No Apostle or early heads of the Church ever tried to update Christ's doctrine to the standards of Society. Think about it, you fools, if sinners are to define holiness, then who isn't holy? If sinners are to define sin, then who needs the sacrifice of Christ?\\n\\nAnd for those who think that Christians cannot correct, judge, or rebuke, why does the Spirit of Christ through Paul say otherwise?\\n\\n2TIMOTHY 3:16 All scripture [is] given by inspiration of God, and [is] profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness:\n\nAnswer:",

There are three main kinds of botulism. Foodborne botulism is caused by eating foods that contain the botulism toxin. Wound botulism is caused by toxin produced from a wound infected with Clostridium botulinum. Infant botulism is caused by consuming the spores of the botulinum bacteria, which then grow in the intestines and release toxin. All forms of botulism can be fatal and are considered medical emergencies. Foodborne botulism can be especially dangerous because many people can be poisoned by eating a contaminated food.\\n\\nSo it's an infection caused by a toxin.\n\nAnswer:",

I hope that you are not asking because you have them and expect someone to go down on you.  \\n\\nGenital Warts HPV\\n\\nWhat it is\\nSymptoms\\nLong Term Effects\\nTreatment\\nGenital Warts and Cervical Cancer\\n  \\n\\n\\nWhat it is\\n\\nGenital warts are small, often painless bumps in or round the vagina, penis, or anus.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThey are caused by a virus (a kind of germ). It is called HPV (the human papilloma virus).\\n\\nYou get HPV by having sex with someone who has the virus.\\n\\nHPV is spread by having vaginal, anal, or oral sex.\\n\\nEven if the warts go away or are removed, the virus stays in your body and can be spread to others.\\n\\n\\nTOP\\n\\nSymptoms\\n\\nSome people don't show signs even though the wart virus is in their skin. Others do have signs.\\n\\nPeople may see small bumps (warts) in or around the vagina, penis, or anus.\\n\\nThe bumps may grow in bunches or clusters.\\n\\nThey may itch.\\n\\n\\nThe virus can be spread to others even when there are no signs.\\n\\nTOP\\n\\nLong Term Effects\\n\\nGenital warts can be treated but not cured. The treatment can help make you feel better and can help take away the warts. But you will always have the virus. Having the virus can cause these problems:\\n\\nYou can pass it to others.\\n\\nYou have a higher chance of getting HIV (the virus that causes AIDS).\\n\\n\\nIf a pregnant woman has genital warts, she could have these problems:\\n\\n\\n\\nThe warts could grow and block the vagina.\\n\\nThe baby could get the virus.\\n\\nSome wart medicines are not safe for pregnant women to use.\\n\\n\\nTOP\\n\\nTreatment\\n\\nThe treatment for genital warts is to have a health care provider remove them. There are also some new medicines that you can use at home.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nYou may need an exam of the cervix or penis called a colposcopy. Your clinician uses a magnifying glass with a bright light to see the warts.\\n\\nThe warts can be removed by freezing or burning. Most people need to have more than one visit to remove all the warts.\\n\\n\\nTOP\\n\\nGenital Warts and Cervical Cancer\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIf a woman has the kind of HPV that causes genital warts, she may also have another kind of HPV that causes cervical cancer.\\n\\nAny woman who has had genital warts should have a Pap smear at least once a year to check for cervical cancer.\\n\\n\\nPlease be safe.\n\nAnswer:",

Are Jewish people still waiting for a Messiah?\nQuestion: Or have they given up hope that a messiah will ever come?  Christians believe that Jesus Christ is the son of God and the Messiah, yet Jewish people reject him.  If Jewish people do believe that a messiah will come, how will they recognize him?  I am a Christian who has always been curious about this; I honestly mean no disrespect to your faith.  Are there any Jewish people who can shed some light?  Thank you, I appreciate it.\nAnswer: first off all American their is a list that one must do to be called the messiah. and yes Jews are still waiting for the first person to complete that check list. \\n\\nhere it is -- it is detialed and long so bear with\\n\\nTHE MESSIAH ACCORDING TO JUDAISM\\nOne of the basic premises upon which Christianity rests is that Jesus was the Messiah predicted in the Jewish Bible. Judaism has always rejected this belief. Since the goal of \"Hebrew Christian\" missionaries is to convince Jews that Jesus did in fact fulfill the requirements of the promised Messiah, it is necessary to examine the Jewish understanding of the Messiah to understand why such claims are simply not true.\\n\\nTHE HEBREW ROOTS OF THE WORD \"MESSIAH\"\\n\\nThe Hebrew word for \"Messiah\" is \"Moshiach --.\" The literal and proper translation of this word is \"anointed,\" which refers to a ritual of anointing and consecrating someone or some-thing with oil. (I Samuel 10:1-2) It is used throughout the Jewish Bible in reference to a wide variety of individuals and objects; for example, a Jewish king (I Kings 1:39), Jewish priests (Leviticus 4:3), prophets (Isaiah 61:1), the Jewish Temple and its utensils (Exodus 40:9-11), unleavened bread (Numbers 6:15), and a non-Jewish king (Cyrus king of Persia, Isaiah 45:1).\\n\\nTHE CRITERIA TO BE FULFILLED BY THE JEWISH MESSIAH\\n\\nIn an accurate translation of the Jewish Scriptures, the word \"Moshiach\" is never translated as \"Messiah,\" but as \"anointed.\"1Nevertheless, Judaism has always maintained a fundamental belief in a Messianic figure. Since the concept of a Messiah is one that was given by G-d to the Jews, Jewish tradition is best qualified to describe and recognize the expected Messiah. This tradition has its foundation in numerous biblical references, many of which are cited below. Judaism understands the Messiah to be a human being (with no connotation of deity or divinity) who will bring about certain changes in the world and who must fulfill certain specific criteria before being acknowledged as the Messiah.\\n\\nThese specific criteria are as follows:\\n\\n1) He must be Jewish. (Deuteronomy 17:15, Numbers 24:17)\\n\\n2) He must be a member of the tribe of Judah (Genesis 49:10) and a direct male descendent of both King David (I Chronicles 17:11, Psalm 89:29-38, Jeremiah 33:17, II Samuel 7:12-16) and King Solomon. (I Chronicles 22:10, II Chronicles 7:18)\\n\\n3) He must gather the Jewish people from exile and return them to Israel. (Isaiah 27:12-13, Isaiah 11:12)\\n\\n4) He must rebuild the Jewish Temple in Jerusalem. (Micah 4:1)\\n\\n5) He must bring world peace. (Isaiah 2:4, Isaiah 11:6, Micah 4:3)\\n\\n6) He must influence the entire world to acknowledge and serve one G-d. (Isaiah 11:9, Isaiah 40:5, Zephaniah 3:9)\\n\\nAll of these criteria for the Messiah are best stated in the book of Ezekiel chapter 37:24-28: \\n\\n\"And My servant David will be a king over them, and they will all have one shepherd, and they will walk in My ordinances, and keep My statutes, and observe them, and they shall live on the land that I gave to Jacob My servant...and I will make a covenant of peace with them; it will be an everlasting covenant and I will set my sanctuary in their midst forever and My dwelling place shall be with them, and I will be their G-d and they will be My people. And the nations will know that I am the Lord who sanctifies Israel, when My sanctuary is in their midst forever.\" \\n\\nIf an individual fails to fulfill even one of these conditions, he cannot be the Messiah.\\n\\nWHY JESUS COULD NOT HAVE BEEN THE JEWISH MESSIAH\\n\\nA careful analysis of these criteria shows us that, although Jesus was Jewish, he did not fulfill any of the other criteria. An examination of the contradictory accounts of Jesus' genealogy demonstrates a number of difficulties with the fulfillment of the second criterion. Specifically, the New Testament claims that Jesus did not have a phy\n\nAnswer:",

Some answers for this question can be obtained by simply refering to 'The Uniform Code of Military Justice' (UCMJ). The UCMJ is federal law, enacted by Congress. Its provisions are contained in United States Code, Title 10, Chapter 47. Article 36 of the UCMJ allows the President to prescribe rules and procedures to implement the provisions of the UCMJ. The President does this via the Manual for Courts-Martial (MCM) which is an executive order that contains detailed instructions for implementing military law for the United States Armed Forces. It applies to all US service members in all the branches (Army, Marines, Air Force and Navy). Under the UCMJ, there are a few Articles in which someone leaving the battle against an enemy could be legally prosecuted. To name a few:\\n\\nArticle 92-  Failure to obey order or regulation \\nArticle 99-  Misbehavior before the enemy (your main charge)\\nArtcile 134- General Article\\n\\nArticle 92: Any person subject to this chapter who--\\n\\n(1) violates or fails to obey any lawful general order or regulation; \\n\\n(2) having knowledge of any other lawful order issued by any member of the armed forces, which it is his duty to obey, fails to obey the order; or\\n\\n(3) is derelict in the performance of his duties;\\n\\nshall be punished as a court-martial may direct.\\n\\nComment: Unless there was the order to \"retrograde\" (nice way of saying \"retreat\"); by leaving the battle the person violated an order (attack, defend, etc). This should be one of your supporting arguments/charges.\\n\\nArticle 99- Any person subject to this chapter who before or in the presence of the enemy--\\n\\n(1) runs away;\\n\\n(2) shamefully abandons, surrenders, or delivers up any command, unit, place, or military property which it is his duty to defend;\\n\\n(3) through disobedience, neglect, or intentional misconduct endangers the safety of any such command, unit, place, or military property;\\n\\n(4) casts away his arms or ammunition;\\n\\n(5) is guilty of cowardly conduct;\\n\\n(6) quits his place of duty to plunder or pillage;\\n\\n(7) causes false alarms in any command, unit, or place under control of the armed forces;\\n\\n(8) willfully fails to do his utmost to encounter, engage, capture, or destroy any enemy troops, combatants, vessels, aircraft, or any other thing, which it is his duty so to encounter, engage, capture, or destroy; or\\n\\n(9) does not afford all practicable relief and assistance to any troops, combatants, vessels, or aircraft of the armed forces belonging to the United States or their allies when engaged in battle;\\n\\nshall be punished by death or such punishment as a court-martial may direct.\\n\\nComment: Pretty direct and simply answer...this should be your main argument/charge.\\n\\nArtcile 134- All disorders and neglects to the prejudice of good order and discipline in the armed forces, all conduct of a nature to bring discredit upon the armed forces, and crimes and offenses not capital, of which persons subject to this chapter may be guilty, shall be taken cognizance of by a general, special or summary court-martial, according to the nature and degree of the offense, and shall be punished at the discretion of that court.\\n\\nComment: Basically this article is used today to prosecute \"anything under the sun\"...from a soldier rolling his eyes at a Sergeant...to a soldier getting a sunburn (damage to government property). This is another supporting argument/charge.\\n\\nIf the person was an officer I would look at adding on the charge of \"Conduct unbecoming an Officer and Gentleman\" Article 133...which states \"Any commissioned officer, cadet, or midshipman who is convicted of conduct unbecoming an officer and a gentleman shall be punished as a court-martial may direct.\"\\n\\nThese are just three charges, there are a few others that would possible be used...but these three definately are some of the top ones. Unless the person charged for this offens\n\nAnswer:",

And hve u ever had it before?\nAnswer: Impetigo, a contagious skin infection that usually produces blisters or sores on the face and hands, is one of the most common skin infections among kids.\\n\\nIt is generally caused by one of two bacteria: group A streptococcus or staphylococcus aureus. Impetigo usually affects preschool and school-age children, especially in the summer months. A child may be more likely to develop impetigo if the skin has already been irritated or injured by other skin problems, such as eczema, poison ivy, insect bites, or a skin allergy to soap or makeup. \\n\\nGood hygiene can help prevent impetigo, which often develops when there is a sore or a rash that has been scratched repetitively (for example, poison ivy can get infected and turn into impetigo). Impetigo is typically treated with antibiotics.\\n\\nSigns and Symptoms\\nImpetigo may affect skin anywhere on the body but commonly occurs around the nose and mouth, hands, and forearms.\\n\\nWhen impetigo is caused by group A streptococcus, it begins as tiny blisters. These blisters eventually burst and leave small wet patches of red skin that may weep fluid. Gradually, a tan or yellowish-brown crust covers the affected area, making it look like it has been coated with honey or brown sugar.\\n\\nImpetigo that is caused by staphylococcus aureus triggers larger fluid-containing blisters that appear clear, then cloudy. These blisters are more likely to stay intact longer on the skin without bursting.\\n\\nContagiousness\\nImpetigo may itch and can be spread by scratching. Kids can spread the infection by scratching it and then touching other parts of the body.\\n\\nImpetigo is contagious and can spread to anyone who comes into contact with infected skin or other items, such as clothing, towels, and bed linens, that have been touched by infected skin.\\n\\nTreatment\\nWhen it just affects small areas of the skin, impetigo can usually be treated with antibiotic ointment. But if the infection has spread to many areas of the body, or the ointment isn't working, your child's doctor may prescribe an antibiotic pill or liquid.\\n\\nOnce antibiotic treatment begins, healing should start within a few days. It's important to make sure that your child takes the medication as the doctor has prescribed it. If that doesn't happen, a deeper skin infection or a blood infection could develop.\\n\\nWhile the infection is healing, gently wash the areas of infected skin with clean gauze and antiseptic soap every day. Soak any areas of crusted skin in warm soapy water to help remove the layers of crust (it is not necessary to completely remove all of it).\\n\\nTo keep your child from spreading impetigo to other parts of the body, your child's doctor or nurse will probably recommend covering infected areas of skin with gauze and tape or a loose plastic bandage. Keep your child's fingernails short and clean.\\n\\nPrevention\\nGood hygiene practices, such as regular hand washing, can help prevent impetigo. Use soap and water to clean your child's skin and be sure your child takes baths or showers regularly. Pay special attention to areas of the skin that have been injured, such as cuts, scrapes, bug bites, areas of eczema, and rashes caused by allergic reactions or poison ivy. Keep these areas clean and covered.\\n\\nMake sure that anyone in your family with impetigo keeps his or her fingernails cut short and that the impetigo sores are covered with gauze and tape.\\n\\nPrevent impetigo infection from spreading among family members by using antibacterial soap and making sure that each family member uses a separate towel. If necessary, substitute paper towels for cloth ones until the impetigo is gone. Separate the infected person's bed linens, towels, and clothing from those of other family members, and wash these items in hot water.\\n\\nWhen to Call Your Child's Doctor\\nCall your child's doctor if your child has signs of impetigo, especially if he or she has been exposed to a family member or classmate with t\n\nAnswer:",

It orbits between 29 and 49 AU from the Sun, and was the first Kuiper Belt Object to be discovered. Approximately one-fifth the mass of the Earth's Moon, Pluto is primarily composed of rock and ice. It has an eccentric orbit that is highly inclined with respect to the planets and takes it closer to the Sun than Neptune during a portion of its orbit. Pluto and its largest satellite, Charon, could be considered a binary system because they are closer in size than any of the other known planetoid/moon combinations in the solar system, and because the barycentre of their orbits does not lie within either body. However, the International Astronomical Union (IAU) has yet to formalize a definition for binary dwarf planets, so Charon is regarded as a moon of Pluto. Two smaller moons, Nix and Hydra, were discovered in 2005. Pluto is smaller than several of the natural satellites or moons in our solar system (see the list of solar system objects by radius).\\n\\nFrom its discovery by Clyde Tombaugh in 1930, Pluto was considered the ninth planet from the Sun. In the late 20th and early 21st century, many similar objects were discovered in the outer solar system, most notably the Trans-Neptunian object Eris which is slightly larger than Pluto. In August 2006 the IAU redefined the term \"planet\", and classified Pluto, Ceres, and Eris as dwarf planets.[1] Pluto is also classified as the prototype of a family of trans-Neptunian objects.[2][3] After the reclassification, Pluto was added to the list of minor planets and given the number 134340.[4][5]\\n\\nContents [hide]\\n1 Discovery \\n1.1 Relations to Neptune and Uranus \\n1.2 Percival Lowell's influence \\n1.3 Naming \\n1.4 Symbol \\n2 Physical characteristics \\n2.1 Appearance \\n2.2 Mass and size \\n2.3 Atmosphere \\n2.4 Composition \\n2.5 Orbit \\n2.5.1 Heliocentric distance \\n2.6 Trans-Neptunian object \\n2.7 Comet comparison \\n3 Moons \\n3.1 Charon \\n3.2 Nix and Hydra \\n3.3 Distribution \\n3.4 Additional moons? \\n4 Exploration of Pluto \\n5 Planetary status controversy \\n5.1 Omission from museum models \\n5.2 Commemoration as a planet \\n5.3 New discoveries ignite debate \\n5.4 IAU Decisio\n\nAnswer:",

It is connected with the Arctic Ocean by the Greenland Sea and Smith Sound; with the Pacific Ocean by Drake Passage, the Straits of Magellan, and the Panama Canal; and with the Indian Ocean by the Suez Canal and the expanse between Africa and Antarctica. The shortest distance across the Atlantic Ocean (c.1,600 mi/2,575 km) is between SW Senegal, W Africa, and NE Brazil, E South America. The principal arms of the Atlantic Ocean are Hudson and Baffin bays, the Gulf of Mexico, and the Caribbean Sea in the west; the Baltic, North, Mediterranean, and Black seas in the east; and the Weddell Sea in the south. More large rivers, including the Mississippi, the Congo, and the Amazon, drain into the Atlantic than into any other ocean.\\n\\nOcean Floor\\n\\nThe floor of the Atlantic has an average depth of c.12,000 ft (3,660 m). It is separated from that of the Arctic Ocean by a submarine ridge extending from SE Greenland to N Scotland; part of the floor (c.3,000 ft/910 m deep) is known as \u201ctelegraph plateau\u201d because of the network of cables laid there. A shallow submarine ridge across the Strait of Gibraltar separates the Mediterranean basin from the Atlantic and limits the exchange of water between the two bodies. The Mid-Atlantic Ridge (c.300\u2013600 mi/480\u2013970 km wide), a submarine mountain range extending c.10,000 mi (16,100 km) from Iceland to near the Antarctic Circle, generally follows the trend of the coastlines of the continents. It rises to an average height of c.10,000 ft (3,050 m), and a few peaks emerge as islands. The ridge, which is the center of volcanic activity and earthquakes, has a great rift that is constantly widening (see seafloor spreading) and filling with molten rock from the earth's interior. As a result the Western Hemisphere and Europe and Africa are moving away from each other. The Mid-Atlantic Ridge divides the floor of the Atlantic Ocean into eastern and western sections that are composed of a series of deep-sea basins (abyssal plains). The greatest depth (c.28,000 ft/8,530 m) is the Milwaukee Deep, in the Puerto Rico Trench, N of Puerto Rico. Scientific knowledge of the ocean floor dates from the Challenger expedition (1872\u201376).\n\nAnswer:",

The center is therefore at (-2,3). \\n\\n2)The half length of the axis (the lines bisecting the ellipse) are given by the denominators of the x and y terms.  To find the length of each axis, take the square root of each denominator.  The \"radius\" in the y (vertical) direction is sqrt(25) = 5 units long, and in the x direction it is sqrt(16) = 4 units long.  \\n\\n3)Starting at the center point of the ellipseee, (-2,3), count up half the length of the axis in the y direction, or 5 units, and put a point.  Do the same thing down, and then repeat with the x axis, counting left and right 4 units, and putting points on your graph.  Draw an ellips through these 4 points, and you're done! \\n\\nThe major axis is therefore the y axis, and is 10 units long, and then minor axis is the x axis, which is 8 units long.\\n\\nIf you want to graph this on a calculator, you must solve for y:\\n((y+2)^2)/25 + ((x-3)^2)/16 -((x-3)^2)/16= 1 -((x-3)^2)/16\\n\\n(((y+2)^2)/25)*25 = (1 -((x-3)^2)/16)*25\\n\\n((y+2)^2)^(1/2) = ((1 -((x-3)^2)/16)*25)^(1/2)\\n\\nNote that raising to the (1/2) power is the same as taking the square root. When you take the square root of a real number, your answer could be negative or positive, so you have 2 solutions, one for the bottom of the ellips, and one for the top:\\n\\n(y+2) = (((1 -((x-3)^2)/16)*25)^(1/2))\\nand\\n(y+2) = -(((1 -((x-3)^2)/16)*25)^(1/2))\\n\\nThe final equations you'd enter into your calculator are:\\n\\ny = (((1 -((x-3)^2)/16)*25)^(1/2))-2\\nand\\ny = -(((1 -((x-3)^2)/16)*25)^(1/2))-2\n\nAnswer:",

I did the work and everything but it seems wrong to me.\nAnswer: The correct answer is 4,-5. A simple check confirms that \\n7*4-5*5=28-25=3\\n3*4+2*5=12+10 =22\\n\\nUsing Cramer's rule...\\n\\n.....|3....5|\\n.....|22.-2| \\nx= --------\\n.....|7....5|\\n.....|3...-2|\\n\\nWhich equals:\\n\\n(3*-2 - 22*5)\\n----------------\\n(7*-2 - 3*5)\\n\\nWhich equals:\\n\\n(-6 - 110)\\n------------\\n(-12 - 15)\\n\\nWhich equals\\n\\n(-116)/(-29) = 4. So x = 4.\\n\\nWe could now go back and substitute easily to get that y is -5. But using Cramer's rule once again...\\n\\n.....|7....3|\\n.....|3..22| \\ny= --------\\n.....|7....5|\\n.....|3...-2|\\n\\nWhich equals:\\n\\n(7*22 - 3*3)\\n----------------\\n(7*-2 - 3*5)\\n\\nWhich equals:\\n\\n(154 - 9)\\n------------\\n(-12 - 15)\\n\\nWhich equals\\n\\n(145)/(-29) = -5. So y = -5.\\n\\n\\nPerhaps two easier ways to do it are by elimination or substitution:\\n\\nElimination:\\n7x+5y=3\\n3x-2y=22\\n\\n21x + 15y = 9\\n21x - 14y = 154\\n\\n29y = -154\\ny = -5\\n\\nHere we could go back and substitute, or continue with the elimination. I'll leave you to verify either way that x = 4.\\n\\nSubstitution:\\n7x+5y=3\\n7x = 3 - 5y\\nx = (3 - 5y)/7\\n\\n3x-2y=22\\n\\n3(3 - 5y)/7 -2y = 22\\n(9 - 15y)/7 - 2y = 22\\n(9 - 15y)/7 - (14y/7) = 22\\n(9 - 15y - 14y)/7 = 22\\n9 - 29y = 154\\n-29y = 145\\ny = -5\\n\\nOnce again, you could substitute again or substitute back into the original equations. I'll leave you to verify that x=4.\\n\\n--------------------\\n\\nAlthough I used Cramer's rule to find both variables, once you have one, I mentioned it is easier to substitute to find the other. This applies to elimination and substitution as well. For example, once you know that x=4...\\n\\n7x+5y = 3\\n7*4 + 5y = 3\\n28 + 5y = 3\\n5y = -25\\ny = -5.\\n\\nThis works substitution either variable into either equation.\\n\\nHope this helps ^_^!\n\nAnswer:",

Please see below.)\\n\\nTo install:\\nClose all running applications except for your Internet browser.\\nVisit the Yahoo! Messenger home page.\\nClick the \"Download Now\" button.\\n\\nTo copy your complete Message Archive:\\nClose Yahoo! Messenger (if it is currently running). \\nGo to your Desktop and double-click \"My Computer.\" \\nSelect the \"C:\" drive. \\nGo to:\\nC:&#92;Program Files&#92;Yahoo!&#92;Messenger&#92;Profiles\\nYour \"Profiles\" folder contains your complete Message Archive. Copy it to the same location on another computer if you wish to view it elsewhere.\\n\\nNote: If you copy this folder to another computer, your complete Message Archive will be copied, overriding the Message Archive on the computer to which you are copying.\\n-------------------------------------------------------------\\nAfter that, if you still have problems, make sure that you have the latest version of Macromedia's Flash Player installed, as Messenger uses certain Flash components on startup.  \\n\\nBeyond that, your Yahoo! Messenger connection information may be incorrect. Follow these steps to configure your connection:\\nClick the \"Messenger\" menu in Yahoo! Messenger and select \"Connection Preferences.\"\\nEnable the \"Firewall with no proxies\" option.\\nSelect the correct Internet connection type and country from the pull-down menus.\\nClick the \"OK\" button at the bottom of the window.\\nYahoo! Messenger will ask you if you want to sign in again with your new proxy settings. Click the \"OK\" button.\\nEnter your Yahoo! ID and password and click the \"Sign In\" button.\\n\\nThe above configuration works in most situations. (However, if you connect in this way, you won't be able to use the Voice feature.) If this configuration doesn't work, follow these steps:\\nClick the \"Messenger\" menu in Yahoo! Messenger and select \"Connection Preferences.\"\\nEnable the \"No network detection\" option and then click the \"OK\" button at the bottom of the window.\\nYahoo! Messenger will ask you if you want to sign in again with your new proxy settings. Click the \"OK\" button. \\nEnter your Yahoo!

In type 2 diabetes, hypertension is often present as part of the metabolic syndrome of insulin resistance also including central obesity and dyslipidemia. In type 1 diabetes, hypertension may reflect the onset of diabetic nephropathy. Hypertension substantially increases the risk of both macrovascular and microvascular complications, including stroke, coronary artery disease, and peripheral vascular disease, retinopathy, nephropathy, and possibly neuropathy. In recent years, adequate data from well-designed randomized clinical trials have demonstrated the effectiveness of aggressive treatment of hypertension in reducing both types of diabetes complications.\\n\\n\\nIf your blood pressure is between 120/80 mmHg and 139/89 mmHg, then you have PREHYPERTENSION. This means that you don't have high blood pressure now but are likely to develop it in the future. You can take steps to prevent high blood pressure by adopting a healthy lifestyle.\n\nAnswer:",

Viruses play a significant role in the pathogenesis of many of these infections. Bacteria and other organisms also are responsible.\\n\\nPharyngitis is an inflammatory process of the pharynx, hypopharynx, uvula, and tonsils that can be caused by viral or bacterial infection and, occasionally, both. Distinguishing between these infections is important because rheumatic fever and acute glomerulonephritis may complicate untreated group A beta-hemolytic streptococcal infections (GAS), but they usually can be prevented by appropriate antibiotic treatment.\\n\\nSinusitis is an inflammatory process involving the paranasal sinuses (maxillary, frontal, ethmoid, and sphenoid). It usually is a bacterial complication of a viral upper respiratory infection.\\n\\nEpiglottitis is a life-threatening disease observed most frequently in children aged 1-6 years, often during the fall and winter. Although less common, it also can affect adults.\\n\\nLaryngotracheitis usually is the result of viral infection. The subglottic area and trachea are involved, whereas the area above the true vocal cords is spared. When children younger than 5 years have the infection, it is called croup.\\n\\nThe common cold is a mild, self-limited, catarrhal syndrome caused, for the most part, by members of 5 families of viruses. A small proportion of colds are complicated by bacterial infections of the paranasal sinuses and the middle ear, which require antimicrobial therapy.\n\nAnswer:",

At time t = 0, the reference lines of the two disks have the same orientation. Disk A is already rotating, with a constant angular velocity of 9.5 rad/s. Disk B has been stationary but now begins to rotate at a constant angular acceleration of 2.2 rad/s2. (a) At what time t will the reference lines of the two disks momentarily have the same angular displacement \u03b8 ? (b) Will that time t be the first time since t = 0 that the reference lines are momentarily aligned?\nAnswer: The equations of motion for the angular displacement of each disk are given by:\\n\\nDisk A: R1(t) = (1/2)*alpha1*t\u00b2 + w1*t +Ri1\\nDisk B: R2(t) = (1/2)*alpha2*t\u00b2 + w2*t +Ri2\\n\\nFor part (a), we're looking for the time, T, for which R1(T) = R2(T)\\n\\n(1/2)*alpha1*T\u00b2 + w1*T +Ri1 = (1/2)*alpha2*T\u00b2 + w2*T +Ri2\\n\\nFrom the problem statement, we obtain the following information:\\n\\nRi1 = Ri2\\nalpha1 = 0\\nw1 = 9.5 rad/s\\nalpha2 = 2.2 rad/s\u00b2\\nw2 = 0\\n\\nSubstituting these values and simplifying, we obtain:\\n\\nw1*T= (1/2)*alpha2*T\u00b2\\n\\nw1= (1/2)*alpha2*T\\n\\nT = 2*w1 / (alpha2)\\n\\nT = 2(9.5 rad/s) / (2.2 rad/s\u00b2)\\n\\nT = 8.64 s\\n\\nTechnically, part (b) is impossible to say without knowing how the reference line is defined, but I'll give it a whirl. If the reference line is measured from the center of each disk to its outer edge, then yes.\\n\\nHowever, if the reference line is placed across the diameter of the disk, then no. In this case, the reference lines will be aligned when the angular displacement of Disk A is 180\u00b0 or pi radians ahead of Disk B. To solve for this time, simply add pi to Disk B's equation of motion:\\n\\n(1/2)*alpha1*T\u00b2 + w1*T +Ri1 = (1/2)*alpha2*T\u00b2 + w2*T +Ri2 + pi\\n\\nSubstituting out known values again leads us to:\\n\\nw1*T= (1/2)*alpha2*T\u00b2 + pi\\n\\nor:\\n\\n(1/2)*alpha2*T\u00b2 - w1*T + pi = 0\\n\\n1.1*T\u00b2 - 9.5*T + pi = 0\\n\\nUsing the quadratic formula, we find that \\n\\nT = .344 seconds or 8.292 seconds\\n\\nThus, if the reference line is directed across the entire disk, then they are momentarily aligned twice before having the same angular displacement.\\n\\n(This added after a while)\\n{BTW, monohan47130 - no I didn't. Please read what I wrote. If the reference lines are defined along the radius only, then you are correct - there is only one point at which the disks have the same angular displacement. But, reference lines are typically made along the entire circle (diameter). This means that they will be aligned 3 times total in 8.64 seconds :) }\n\nAnswer:",

Fireworks exploded over uptown Charlotte as jubilant fans gathered to celebrate the news. \"This is a dream come true for me and my partners and for the 10 million people in the Carolinas,\" said Carolina Panthers Owner/Founder Jerry Richardson, who became just the second former player to own an NFL team along with George Halas of the Chicago Bears. \\n\\nThe \"dream\" began on July 16, 1987 when Richardson met in Charlotte with a group of interested parties to discuss the feasibility of entering the multi-city competition for two NFL expansion franchises. On December 15, Richardson officially announced an NFL franchise bid for the Carolinas. \\n\\nOne of the first orders of business was to choose a stadium site. Locations in North and South Carolina were considered. On December 15, 1989, Richardson Sports selected a site in uptown Charlotte as the future home of a privately financed NFL stadium that would seat more than 70,000 fans. \\n\\nAcross the Carolinas, support for an NFL expansion team poured in at an unprecedented rate. U.S. Sens. Jesse Helms of North Carolina and Ernest Hollings of South Carolina lobbied NFL owners on the Carolinas behalf. Likewise, North Carolina Gov. Jim Martin and South Carolina Gov. Carroll Campbell formed a blue-ribbon committee of leading citizens in both states. Fans demonstrated their enthusiasm by selling out preseason games in Raleigh, NC in 1989, Chapel Hill, NC in 1990 and Columbia, SC in 1991. \\n\\nAt the League owners meeting on March 18, 1992, the NFL reduced the list of expansion candidate cities from eleven to seven with the Carolinas making the cut. Two months later, the NFL narrowed the list of expansion hopefuls to five communities \u2013 Baltimore, St. Louis, Memphis, Jacksonville and the Carolinas. \\n\\nHowever, on October 20, 1992, NFL owners decided to delay the expansion vote until the fall of 1993 because of a labor dispute between the League and the players. Fortunately, on January 6, 1993, the League and the players approved a new Collective Bargaining Agreement. On March 23, 1993, the expansion race officially resumed. \\n\\nOn June 3, Richardson Sports revealed its impressive plan to privately finance a 72,300-seat stadium from the sale of Permanent Seat Licenses, club seats and luxury boxes, beginning on July 1. A remarkable 15,000 pieces of mail from first-day orders were collected. By the end of the first day, all 8,314 club seats sold out and all 104 luxury suites were reserved and ultimately leased. First-day PSL orders totaled 41,632. \\n\\nFinally, on October 26, 1993, NFL owners unanimously selected Carolina as the 29th NFL franchise.\n\nAnswer:",

What is Emphysema?\\nFAQ\\n\\nFrom Stacey Lloyd,\\nYour Guide to Lung Diseases.\\n\\nA.\\n\\nEmphysema is a lung disease in which the walls of the alveoli (air sacs) in the lungs fracture or burst. As these alveoli break, the remaining alveoli become enlarged to make up for the loss. This results in a fewer number of alveoli, with many enlarged. \\nWhen alveoli are enlarged, they loose their elasticity. A loss of elasticity in the alveoli results in the inability to eliminate air from the lungs. Therefore, patients must use force (energy) to expel this air. \\n\\nFurthermore, the loss of elasticity in the lungs affects the smaller bronchial tubes. To push air out of the bronchial tubes, a higher pressure must be developed inside the chest. \\n\\nThis higher pressure tends to collapse the smaller bronchial tubes, making it even more difficult to empty air from the alveoli. \\nCoughing becomes very difficult and ineffective in expelling mucus, leaving the lungs more susceptible to lung infections, such as pneumonia. \\n\\n( http://lungdiseases.about.com/od/emphysema/f/emphysema_expl.htm )\\n\\nWhat causes emphysema?\\nEmphysema can be caused by one or a combination of these things:\\n\\nCigarette smoking: Most cases of emphsyema are caused by cigarette smoking. Cigarette smoke reaches deep into the lungs and causes permanent damage. If you have emphysema from cigarettes, the best way to stop your lung damage is to quit smoking as soon as possible. It's never too late to quit smoking. \\nAlpha-1 Antitrypsin deficiency: Some people have emphsyema because of a rare genetic disorder called Alpha-1 Antitrypsin deficiency. People with Alpha-1 are missing an enzyme that protects their lungs. Some people with Alpha-1 deficiency get emphysema without ever having smoked. Other people get emphsyema from the combination of smoking and having Alpha-1 deficiency. \\nAir pollution: There is some evidence that air pollution can contribute to people getting emphysema, especially if the person also smokes.

I can see there is a lot of misunderstanding about diabetes.  The thing you need to know is that there are two types of diabetes.\\n\\nType 1 Diabetes presents more commonly during early childhood or early puberty but can occur at any age.  Type 1 specifically refers to diabetes resulting from the destruction of insulin-secreting cells in your pancreas.  All Type 1 diabetics require insulin because their body no longer makes it.\\n\\nType 2 Diabetes presents more commonly in adulthood but can occur at any age and is being seen in younger and younger patients.  Type 2 specifically refers to diabetes resulting from your body's becoming more resistant (or less sensitive) to the insulin that your pancreas produces.  Most patients can be treated with oral medications that improve your body's sensitivity to your endogenous insulin or stimulate more insulin release from your pancreas.  Type 2 diabetics have high levels of insulin circulating unlike Type 1 diabetics.  Some Type 2 diabetics may go on to need insulin if their oral medications are not adequately controlling their sugars; most will be on a combination of insulin and oral meds.\\n\\nBoth Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes are multifactorial.  There are both genetic and environmental factors that lead to the disease.  Therefore, just because one identical twin has diabetes (either kind) does not necessarily mean that the other will get it as well!\\n\\nPopulation studies have shown that for Type 1 diabetes...\\nIf your mom has Type 1 DM - your risk is 1 in 17\\nIf your mom has Type 1 DM and had you before age 25 - your risk 1 in 25\\nIf your mom has Type 1 DM and had you after age 25 - your risk 1 in 100\\nIf your mom got Type 1 DM before she was 11 - the above risk doubles\\nIf both your parents have Type 1 DM - your risk is 1 in 5\\n\\nFor Type 2 diabetes...\\nIf you have one parent who had Type 2 DM before 50 - your risk is 1 in 7\\nIf you have one parent who had Type 2 DM after 50 - your risk is 1 in 13\\nIf you have two parents with Type 2 DM - your risk is 1 in 2\\nIf you have an identical twin with Type 2 DM - your risk is 3 in 4\\n\\nThis information is all available from the American Diabetes Association.  As you can see, Type 2 diabetes actually has a higher inherited risk than Type 1!  There are things that you can do to minimize your chances of developing Type 2 DM, though, even though you are at risk.  That includes regular exercise, maintenance of a healthy weight, and reducing fat and calorie intake.  There are also some medications that can reduce your risk of developing Type 2 DM; you should talk to your doctor about whether these would be appropriate for you.  Above all, don't worry!  You are expressing concern about your health which is the FIRST STEP!  If you are motivated to take the appropriate steps towards maintaining your health, the odds of preventing diabetes are in your favor!!  Good luck!\\n\\nEDIT:\\nTo justwannaknow - I think what you say is misleading.  The AMA's recommendation in 2002 was for people to take a daily multivitamin.  There is still no recommendation for physicians to advise patients to take herbal supplements and other nutritional supplements like \"Glycoscience\".\\n\\nTo hmt42play - Islet cell transplants are not being recommended for patients with Type 2 diabetes!!!  As you diabetes educator, you should be aware of this!  Type 2 diabetics generally have functioning islet cells and DO produce insulin.  The problem is with insulin resistance so giving them more islet cells would not resolve the underlying problem.  Islet cell transplants are currently only being used in unstable Type 1 diabetics.  Please do not give this poor woman the idea that islet cell transplantation is a cure for Type 2 diabetes!\n\nAnswer:",

Hurricane, tornado\nAnswer: An Air Mass is a large volume of Air having fairly uniform characteristics of temp., atmospheric pressure, and water vapor content.\\n\\nA Front is a boundary or transition zone between two air masses of different density, and thus (usually) of different temperature. A moving front is named according to the advancing air mass, e.g., cold front if colder air is advancing.\\n\\nDewpoint is a measure of atmospheric moisture. It is the temperature to which air must be cooled in order to reach saturation. A higher dew point indicates more moisture present in the air. It is sometimes referred to as Dew Point Temperature.\\nSaturated or Saturation is the cooling of the temp.\\n\\nRelative humidity is  the ratio of the partial pressure of water vapor in a gaseous mixture of air and water to the saturated vapor pressure of water at a given temperature.\\n\\nDewpoint is a measure of atmospheric moisture. It is the temperature to which air must be cooled in order to reach saturation. A higher dew point indicates more moisture present in the air. It is sometimes referred to as Dew Point Temperature.\\n\\nA Hurricane is a storm system fueled by the heat released when moist air rises and the water vapor in it condense. It has sustained winds of at least 33 m/s (64 kt, 74 mph, or 118 km/h). A hurricane of this intensity tends to develop an eye, an area of relative calm at the center of circulation. Surrounding the eye is the eye wall, an area about 10-50 mi wide in which the strongest thunderstorms and winds circulate around the storm\u2019s center.\\n\\nTornado is a violently rotating column of air in contact with the ground and extending from the base of a thunderstorm. \\n\\nThese are self explanatory.\n\nAnswer:",

Find the prime factors of each of the numbers. Remember that you need to consider not only which prime numbers are factors of the numbers, but also HOW MANY TIMES each prime number is used. For example, 2 is the only prime factor of 8, but it occurs 3 times, so the correct prime factors of 8 are 2, 2, 2.\\n\\n2. Make a list of the prime factors you will need in the least common multiple (LCM). This list includes every prime factor for one of the two numbers you started with, and also every prime factor that occurs in the second number but not the first. Importantly, if a factor occurs in the second number MORE TIMES than it occurs in the first, you have to include it in your LCM that many times.\\n\\nExample:\\nFind the LCM of 168 and 180.\\nPrime factors of 168:  2, 2, 2, 3, 7\\nPrime factors of 180:  2, 2, 3, 3, 5\\n\\nPrime factors of LCM: 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 5, 7 \\n\\nExplanation: 2, 2, 2, 3, 7 are all the prime factors of 168.\\nWe then need another 3 (the factors of 180 include a second 3) and a 5 (since 180 had a 5, which 168 did not).\n\nAnswer:",

Alcohol, tomatoes, spices, chocolate, caffeine, citrus drinks, artificial sweeteners and acidic foods may irritate your bladder. That makes symptoms worse. Try removing these things from your diet for a couple of weeks. Then try eating one food at a time to see if it makes your symptoms worse. \\nSmoking. Many people with interstitial cystitis find that smoking makes their symptoms worse. Because smoking is also a main cause of bladder cancer, people with interstitial cystitis have another good reason to quit smoking. \\nBladder training. Many people can train their bladder to urinate less often. You can train your bladder by going to the bathroom at scheduled times and using relaxation techniques. \\nPhysical therapy and biofeedback. People with interstitial cystitis may have painful spasms of pelvic floor muscles. If you have muscle spasms, you can learn exercises to help strengthen and relax your pelvic floor muscles. \\nTENS (this stands for \"transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation\"). You can use a TENS machine to put mild electrical pulses into your body through special wires. Some doctors think that electrical pulses increase blood flow to the bladder. The increased blood flow strengthens the muscles that help control the bladder. It also releases hormones that block pain.\n\nAnswer:",

A= -7, B =4\\nb. A= 3, B = 7\\nc. A = 7, B = 4\\nd. A = 4, B = 7\nAnswer: Partial fraction decomposition is simply the undoing of the process of adding two unlike fractions. For example, one would add 1/3 to 2/5 by saying 1/3 + 2/5 = 5/(5*3) + (3*2)/(5*3) = [5 + (3*2)] / (5*3) = 11/15.\\nPartial fraction decomposition is noting that in the fraction 11/15, the denominator is the product 5*3 and finding the numbers A and B such that 11/15 = A/3 + B/5. From the above, we know that A = 1 and B = 2. \\nIn the case of a variable denominator that is a polynomial, we know from algebra that all polynomials can be factored (over the real numbers) into a product of monomials, binomials, and quadratics. These forms are convenient because they yield easy integrations (if you're not up to calculus yet).\\nIn your case, we have (11x - 2)/(x^2 + x - 6) = (11x - 2)/[(x + 3)*(x - 2)].\\nWe thus want to find A and B such that we can write this fraction in the simpler form (for integration) A/(x + 3) + B/(x - 2).\\nTo find A and B, we evaluate the sum above to get [A(x - 2) + B(x + 3)]/[(x + 3)(x - 2)]. Since the numerator must be 11x - 2, we have Ax - 2A + Bx + 3B = 11x - 2. \\nGrouping like terms, we get (A + B)x + (3B - 2A) = 11x + (-2).\\nThus, A + B = 11 and 3B - 2A = -2. Solving the first equation for A, we get A = 11 - B. Plugging this value of A into the second equation gives us 3B - 2(11 - B) = -2. Solving for B, we get B = 4. Thus, A = 11 - 4 = 7.\\nOnce you get used to this, you will find that it is a lot quicker than manually plugging in all 4 multiple choice values.\n\nAnswer:",

Various verses are cited (out of context) and the verses that people use to show that homosexuality is wrong are explained away.  The world wants to change God's words and meanings into something more suitable to its sinful desires.  Nevertheless, the truth stands:  The Bible condemns homosexuality as a sin. Let's look at what it says. \\n\\nLev. 18:22, \"You shall not lie with a male as one lies with a female; it is an abomination.\" \\n\\nLev. 20:13, \"If there is a man who lies with a male as those who lie with a woman, both of them have committed a detestable act; they shall surely be put to death. Their bloodguiltness is upon them\" \\n\\n1 Cor. 6:9-10, \"Or do you not know that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived; neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor homosexuals, 10nor thieves, nor the covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor swindlers, shall inherit the kingdom of God.\" \\n\\nRom. 1:26-28, \"For this reason God gave them over to degrading passions; for their women exchanged the natural function for that which is unnatural, 27and in the same way also the men abandoned the natural function of the woman and burned in their desire toward one another, men with men committing indecent acts and receiving in their own persons the due penalty of their error. 28And just as they did not see fit to acknowledge God any longer, God gave them over to a depraved mind, to do those things which are not proper.\" \\n\\n      Homosexuality is clearly condemned by the Bible.   It goes against the created order of God.  He created Adam and then made a woman.  This is what God has ordained and it is what is right.  Unlike other sins, homosexuality has a severe judgment administered by God Himself. This judgment is simple: They are given over to their passions. That means that their hearts are allowed to be hardened by their sins (Romans 1:18ff). As a result, they can no longer see the error of what they are doing. Without an awareness of their sinfulness, there will be no repentance and trusting in Jesus. Without Jesus, they will have no forgiveness. Without forgiveness, there is no salvation. \\n\\nWhat should be the Christian's Response to the Homosexual? \\n\\n      Just because someone is a homosexual does not mean that we cannot love him (or her) or pray for him (her). Homosexuality is a sin and like any other sin, it needs to be dealt with in the only way possible. It needs to be laid at the cross, repented of, and never done again. \\n      As a Christian, you should pray for the salvation of the homosexual the same you would any other person in sin. The homosexual is still made in the image of God -- even though he is in grave sin.  Therefore, you should show him same dignity as anyone else you come in contact with. However, this does not mean that you are to approve of their sin. Don't compromise your witness for a socially acceptable opinion that is void of godliness.\nAnswer: If I give you that the bible does seem to indicate that homosexuality is NOT a preferred activity for men (although women are never mentioned in this  context)...\\n\\nCan you give me the fact it is not one of the 10 commandments and thus not one of the mortal sins and thus is a venial (lesser) sin.\\n\\nAND the fact that we accept and seemingly encourage intentional violation of the mortal sins and the 10 Commandments.\\n\\nIn the sake of time, I will just point out two...\\n\\n5th Commandment: Thou Shalt Not Kill.\\n- WE still sentence criminals to death & send soldiers to kill innocents\\n\\n10th Commandment: Thou Shalt not Covet thy Neighbor's Property.\\n- Do we not encourage avarice and envy through fashion, fads, marketing, and waste?\\n\\nThe issue is, Humans are flawed, we kill, steal, have greed, sloth, and much, much more. \\n\\nAs long as you hold 100% true to your beliefs, and REFUSE to support leaders who send troops to kill, encourage greed, do not believe in charity, encourage us to shop to fight terrorists, et al, then I will back you 100% in any argument you make supporting the teachings of the bible. \\n\\nI have complete respect for an enlightened person willing to not be selective in THEIR views as well and not spout a \"socially acceptable opinion that is void of godliness\"\n\nAnswer:",

You can use the information below as a reference to guide yourself and figure out how long derogatory information stays on your credit report\\n\\nGeneral credit information: 7yrs\\nCollections: 7yrs from date of last activity\\nBankruptcy: 10 yrs\\nForeclosure: 12 yrs from the date filed\\nGarnishment: 12 yrs from the date or entry or 7 yrs from the date satisfied\\nJudgment: 12 yrs from the date or entry or 7 yrs from the date satisfied\\nTax lien: 12 yrs from the date or entry or 7 yrs from the date satisfied\\nDismissed garnishments, judgments, and tax liens: not reportable\\n\\nNow that you have this information I\u2019ll give you an example similar to a client. The agent he had worked with before gave him the wrong advice.\\n\\nLets assume that you had a collection for $1,000 filed against you in December 1998 and you haven\u2019t paid it. It\u2019s now November 2005, so in a few weeks that collection can come off your credit report. (You will probably have to request all three credit bureaus to take it off your credit report). However, you just applied for a loan today and the loan officer tells you that you need to payoff that debt in order to be approved. Since you have the money to pay it off, you do so. Because the date of last activity is now November 2005, the collection will show on your report until November 2012 \u2013 another additional 7 years.\\n\\nNow let assume that this collection was in June 2005 and you pay it off in November 2005 to obtain the loan, this will reduce your credit score. On the other hand if this collection was in September 2005 and you pay it off in November 2005 to obtain the loan, this will actually increase your score. My point is that a collection account that is less than 6 months old and is paid off will be beneficial but if your collection account is more than 6 months old and is paid off this will be detrimental to your credit score.\\n\\nYou as a consumer can request copies of your credit report from the 3 credit bureaus (although it\u2019s better to get a collective report from all three in one which I can help you with) and dispute information that is incorrect. Incorrect information can be corrected or removed but correct information (good or bad) usually stays on the report for the period allowed. Only the credit grantor (lender/bank) or credit bureau can remove correct information.\\n\\nIf you find incorrect information on your report, contact the credit grantor obtain an explanation, have them corrected and ask them to contact all three credit bureaus and correct that information on your report. After this you should also contact all three credit with a letter with documented proof of the error on your report and ask them to remove this information. The credit bureaus by law have to respond to your letter and request. Depending on your case they might approve or deny your request but they have to respond to your letter. Following are the addresses for all three credit bureaus.\\n\\nTrans Union\\nPO Box 4000\\nChester, PA 19022\\n866-887-2673\\nhttp://www.transunion.com/\\n\\nExperian\\nPO Box 2002\\nAllen, TX 75013\\n888-397-3742\\nhttp://www.experian.com/\\n\\nEquifax Credit\\nPO Box 740241\\nAtlanta, GA 30374\\n800-685-1111\\nhttp://www.equifax.com/\n\nAnswer:",

They assume that the caloric content of such steak cuts is normally distributed and \u03c3 is known. One thousand independent samples,ak cuts is normally distributed and \u03c3 is known. One thousand independent samples,each of size n, are to be drawn and for each sample, the interval ( X \u2013 0.96 (\u03c3/sqrt(n), + X - 1.06(\u03c3/sqrt(n) is constructed. What is the approximate probability that at least 690 of the intervals will contain the unknown \u00b5?\nAnswer: I assume that you mean that 1.06*se was added to xbar.  I think that's what you mean.  Otherwise your interval was not well defined.  The minimum value is larger than the maximum.\\n\\nSince you have a normally distributed population with a known sd sigma, then xbar would have a normal distribution.  You subtracted 0.96 standard errors and added 1.06 standard errors, so you would need to look up the area between -0.96 and 1.06 on the standard normal table.\\n\\nP(xbar - 0.96(sigma/sqrt(n)) < mu < xbar + 1.06(sigma/sqrt(n)))\\n= P(- 0.96(sigma/sqrt(n)) < mu - xbar < 1.06(sigma/sqrt(n)))\\n= P(-0.96 < (mu-xbar)/(sigma/sqrt(n)) < 1.06)\\n= P(-0.96 < z < 1.06)\\n\\nThat would turn out to be 0.8554-0.1685 = 0.6869.  That would be the probablity that mu would be in one of these confidence intervals.\\n\\nTo find the probability that mu will be in at least 690 of the 1000 intervals, you would need to recognize that this is a binomial.  There are n = 1000 trials, each trial has probability of success p = 0.6869, and the trials are independent.  np and n(1-p) are both greater than or equal to 5, so the sample size is large enough.  Using the normal approximation to the binomial, the mean would be 686.9 and the standard deviation would be sqrt(1000*.6869*(1-0.6869)) = 14.67.  Using the continuity correction, I would need to start at a value of 689.5.\\n\\nz = (689.5-686.9)/14.67 = 0.18\\n\\nLooking that up on your table, the area to the right is 1-0.5714 = 0.4286.  There is a 42.86% chance of getting at least 690 intervals that contain mu.\n\nAnswer:",

As chemists developed ways to learn about the structure of atoms, it became apparent that this regularity could be explained on the basis of the arrangement of the electrons in atoms, especially the number of electrons most distant from the nucleus.\\n\\nThe arrangement of electrons helps explain the formation of different kinds of chemical bonds. Some bonds result from the donation of one or more electrons from one atom to another atom in the compound.Bonds of this type are called ionic, and compounds with bonds of this type are called ionic compounds. The component parts of ionic compounds are called ions. For example, sodium chloride is an ionic compound formed when electrons from sodium atoms move to chlorine atoms.The sodium atom is converted into a sodium ion with a positive charge.The chlorine atom is converted into a chloride ion with a negative charge.\\n\\nCovalent bonds are formed when electrons from two or more atoms are shared. Compounds formed in this way are called covalent compounds. Carbon tetrachloride is an example of a covalent compound. Four chlorine atoms surround a carbon atom. Each chlorine atom shares one of its electrons with the carbon; and, conversely, the carbon atom shares its electrons with the chlorine atoms.\\n\\nIn metals, the atoms are closely packed together in rows and layers. These rows and layers explain why metals are easy to bend. The loosely-bound outer electrons in metal are shared among many atoms, creating a \u00ecsea\u00ee of negative charges holding the metal ions in place. This is called metallic bonding. The type of bonding, whether ionic, covalent, or metallic, determines the properties and the ways in which we use substances!\\n\\nChemical reactions occur when the atoms are taken apart or rearranged. Energy is conserved in such reactions;that is, the energy of the reactants is equal to the energy of the products.\\n\\nChemical reactions proceed at different rates. Some, such as the rusting of iron, proceed slowly. Others, such as the burning of methane gas, proceed rapidly. Temperature, surface area, air pressure, and the presence of moisture or catalysts are all conditions that affect the rates of chemical reactions. Catalysts are substances that increase the rate of a reaction but are not changed themselves when the reactions are complete.\\n\\nHuman understanding of these principles of chemistry has enabled us to make hundreds of thousands of useful products, which enhance our lives greatly.\n\nAnswer:",

The\\nchicken was faced with significant challenges to\\ncreate and develop the competences required for the\\nnewly competitive market.  Andersen, in  a  partnering\\nrelationship with the client, helped the  chicken  by\\nrethinking  its  physical  distribution  strategy and\\nimplementation processes.

Red flowers have genotype RR, pink Rr or rR, and white rr. \\n\\nYou count the number of each kind of flower. It turns out there are 150 red-flowered plants, 480 pink, and 170 white ones. \\n\\nTherefore there are 2*(150+480+170) = 1600 alleles out there. There are 300 Rs in the red plants, 480 in the pink ones and 0 in the white. Added together there are 780. 780/1600 = 0.4875, so the frequency of the R allele is 48.75%\\n\\nAs for the r allele, there are 0 in the red-flowered plants, 480 in the pink, and 340 in the white. Added together, there are 820. 820/1600 is 51.25%.\\n\\nAs a double check, 48.75% + 51.25% = 100%\n\nAnswer:",

He was born on January 26, 1880 in Little Rock Barracks, Arkansas. He died on April 5, 1964. He's best known as the American general who said \"I shall return.\"\\n\\nHe was one of the most popular and accomplished U.S. military leaders of the 20th century, known primarily for commanding Allied forces in the southwest Pacific during World War II. MacArthur graduated first in his class from West Point Academy (1903) and a few months later was sent to the Philippines, where he worked as an aide to his father, General Arthur MacArthur, Jr. After an illustrious career in World War I, Douglas served in the Philippines as major general (1922-25), commanded the Department of the Philippines (1928-30) and served in the U.S. as chief of staff of the Army (1930-35). In 1935 he was again sent to the Philippines to organize defenses in preparation for their independence. In 1937 he retired from the Army rather than leave his Philippine project uncompleted, but he was recalled to active duty when it became clear that war with Japan was imminent (1941). Overrun by Japanese forces at Bataan, MacArthur was ordered by President Franklin Roosevelt to withdraw to Australia. Before MacArthur and his family escaped, he made the famous vow, \"I shall return.\" In 1942 he was made the supreme commander of Allied forces in the southwest Pacific and by 1945 had liberated the Philippines on the way to invading Japan. MacArthur accepted the Japanese surrender in Tokyo Bay on 2 September 1945, then led the occupation forces in the reconstruction of Japan. After North Korea invaded South Korea in 1950, MacArthur was put in charge of United Nations forces and successfully drove the invaders back. His enthusiasm for pushing on and attacking areas of China was not shared by President Harry Truman, who relieved MacArthur of his command in 1951. Still considered a national hero, MacArthur gave a famous address to Congress and retired. Flamboyant and confident, MacArthur has been called arrogant and egotistical, but his amphibious campaigns in World War II and in Korea are considered brilliant examples of military strategy.\\n\\nMacArthur is often cited as the source of the quote: \"Old soldiers never die, they just fade away.\" He said it in his speech before Congress, but prefaced the quote by saying that it was from one of the popular \"barrack ballads\" he had heard as a cadet at West Point.\n\nAnswer:",

The current Speaker is Dennis Hastert, a Republican Congressman from Illinois, whose term will expire at the end of the 109th Congress on January 3, 2007. On November 16, Nancy Pelosi, the House Democratic leader, was nominated by her party to be Speaker of the House for the 110th Congress; she will then be the first woman to hold the office.  The office of Speaker was created by the Constitution of the United States. The Speaker is elected by the House of Representatives, and is its highest-ranking officer.  In the Presidential line of succession, the Speaker is second in the line, after the Vice President of the United States.  \\n\\nThe Majority Leader of the United States House of Representatives acts as the leader of the party that has a majority control of the seats in the house (currently at least 218 of the 435 seats). The Majority Leader works with the Speaker of the House and the Majority Whip to coordinate ideas and supporting votes for legislation.   Rep. Steny Hoyer was selected to be the next majority leader for the 110 Congress on November 16.  His term will start on January 3, 2007 as well.  Rep. John Boehner from Ohio is the current majority leader in the House.\n\nAnswer:",

Choose one from the option.\nOption: Society & Culture, Science & Mathematics, Health, Education & Reference, Computers & Internet, Sports, Business & Finance, Entertainment & Music, Family & Relationships, Politics & Government \nQuestion: what is the relation of the mass of stars to its evolution?\nAnswer: Star formation occurs in molecular clouds, large regions of high density in the interstellar medium (though still less dense than the inside of an earthly vacuum chamber). Star formation begins with gravitational instability inside those clouds, often triggered by shockwaves from supernovae or collision of two galaxies (as in a starburst galaxy). High mass stars powerfully illuminate the clouds from which they formed. One example of such a nebula is the Orion Nebula.\\n\\nStars spend about 90% of their lifetime fusing hydrogen to produce helium in high-temperature and high-pressure reactions near the core. Such stars are said to be on the main sequence.\\n\\nSmall stars (called red dwarfs) burn their fuel very slowly and last tens to hundreds of billions of years. At the end of their lives, they simply become dimmer and dimmer, fading into black dwarfs. However, since the lifespan of such stars is greater than the current age of the universe (13.7 billion years), no black dwarfs exist yet.\\n\\nAs most stars exhaust their supply of hydrogen, their outer layers expand and cool to form a red giant. In about 5 billion years, when the Sun is a red giant, it will be so large that it will consume both Mercury and Venus. Eventually the core is compressed enough to start helium fusion, and the star heats up and contracts. Larger stars will also fuse heavier elements, all the way to iron, which is the end point of the process. Since iron nuclei are more tightly bound than any heavier nuclei, they cannot be fused to release energy. Likewise, since they are more tightly bound than all lighter nuclei, energy cannot be released by fission. In old, very massive stars, a large core of inert iron will accumulate in the center of the star.\\n\\nAn average-size star will then shed its outer layers as a planetary nebula. The core that remains will be a tiny ball of degenerate matter not massive enough for further fusion to take place, supported only by degeneracy pressure, called a white dwarf. These too will fade into black dwarfs over very long stretches of time.\\n\\n \\nThe Crab Nebula, remnants of a supernova which occurred around 1050 AD.In larger stars, fusion continues until an iron core accumulates that is too large to be supported by electron degeneracy pressure. This core will suddenly collapse as its electrons are driven into its protons, forming neutrons and neutrinos in a burst of inverse beta decay. The shockwave formed by this sudden collapse causes the rest of the star to explode in a supernova. Supernovae are so bright that they may briefly outshine the star's entire home galaxy. When they occur within the Milky Way, supernovae have historically been observed by naked-eye observers as \"new stars\" where none existed before. Eventually, most of the matter in a star is blown away by the explosion (forming nebulae such as the Crab Nebula) and what remains will be a neutron star (sometimes a pulsar or X-ray burster) or, in the case of the largest stars, a black hole.\\n\\nThe blown-off outer layers of dying stars include heavy elements which may be recycled during new star formation. These heavy elements allow the formation of rocky planets. The outflow from supernovae and the stellar wind of large stars play an important part in shaping the interstellar medium.\n\nAnswer:",

The name is derived from the Swahili word meaning \"that which bends up\" in reference to the stooped posture developed as a result of the arthritic symptoms of the disease. The disease is not considered to be fatal. However, in 2005-2006, 77 deaths have been associated with chikungunya in R\u00e9union island.\\n\\nfor more:\\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chikungunya\n\nAnswer:",

When the spring is compressed 0.120m, the gun is able to launch a 0.035kg projectile to a max height of 20.0m when released vertically from rest. Neglect the effects of friction:\\n\\nA. Predict the spring constant.\\nB. Predict the speed of the projectile as it moves through the equilibrium position of the spring.\nAnswer: Energy is conserved so the gravitational potential energy (ge) of the projectile is equal to the spring potential energy (se) expended by the spring.\\n\\nge=mgh and se=1/2 k(x2-x1)^2, where x1 is the spring position when compressed and x2 is the equilibrium spring position. (x1-x2) is spring displacement.\\n\\nGiven: (x1-x1)=0.120m, m=0.035kg, h=20.0m.\\n\\nA) Find spring constant, k.\\nee=se\\nmgh=1/2 k(x2-x1)^2\\nk=2mgh/(x2-x1)^2\\n2*0.035kg*9.8m/s^2*20m/.12m)^2\\nk=953N/m\\n\\nB) Find projective speed as it moves through spring equilibrium position.\\n\\nIf you set your 0 on the x-axis to the position where the spring is compressed, then x1 would be 0 and x2 would be 0.12m. So the spring equilibrium position is at x2=0.12m.\\n\\nNow use the kinematic equations of motion to find the projectile speed when spring displacement is 0.12m. You can assume constant acceleration to be 9.8m/s^2.\\n\\n(vf)^2=(vi)^2+2ad where vf and vi are final and initial velocity, respectively, vi=0, and d=(x2-x1)=x2.\\n\\nvf=sqrt(2*a*x2)\\nvf=sqrt[2(9.8m/s^2)(.12m)]\\nvf=2.325m/s\n\nAnswer:",

All of these radicals have both natural and anthropogenic (manmade) sources. At the present time, most of the OH and NO in the stratosphere is of natural origin, but human activity has dramatically increased the chlorine and bromine. These elements are found in certain stable compounds, especially chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), which may find their way to the stratosphere and there be liberated by the action of ultraviolet light. Most importantly, the chlorine atoms so generated destroy ozone molecules in a catalytic cycle. In this cycle, a chlorine atom reacts with an ozone molecule, taking an oxygen atom with it (forming ClO) and leaving a normal oxygen molecule. A free oxygen atom then takes away the oxygen from the ClO, and the final result is an oxygen molecule and a chlorine atom, which then reinitiates the cycle. A single chlorine atom would keep on destroying ozone forever were it not for reactions that remove them from this cycle by forming reservoir species such as hydrochloric acid and chlorine nitrate. On a per atom basis, bromine is even more efficient than chlorine at destroying ozone, but there is much less bromine in the atmosphere at present. As a result, both chlorine and bromine contribute significantly to the overall ozone depletion.\\n\\nPolar stratospheric clouds\\nThe reactivation of atomic chlorine from these reservoir species is normally slow, but is enhanced by the presence of polar stratospheric clouds which appear during Antarctic winters, leading to a strong seasonal cycle in ozone hole formation.\\n\\nFor more info go to http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ozone_depletion\n\nAnswer:",

Osteoporotic bones are more susceptible to fracture. Osteoporosis is defined by the World Health Organization (WHO) as either a bone mineral density 2.5 standard deviations below peak bone mass (20-year-old sex-matched healthy person average) as measured by DXA, or any fragility fracture. While treatment modalities are becoming available (such as the bisphosphonates), prevention is still considered the most important way to reduce fracture. Due to its hormonal component, more women, particularly after menopause, suffer from osteoporosis than men. In addition it may be caused by various hormonal conditions, smoking and medications (specifically glucocorticoids).\\n\\nclick here:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osteoporosis#Signs_and_symptoms\n\nAnswer:",

In how many ways can the grouping be done so that each group has at least one boy?\\n\\nWhen putting a boy in each of the 5 groups, must we take into account of the possible combinations?\\n\\nCan anyone pls help? Thanks!\nAnswer: This is a very difficult counting problem.  I will show one possible grouping and count the number of ways it can be done.\\n\\nTo put just 1 boy in group 1, there are 10 ways to pick the boy and \"combination of 15 things taken 4 at a time\" ways to pick the girls.  This is 10 * (15*14*13*12 / 1*2*3*4) = 10*1365 = 13650 ways to pick 4 girls and 1 boy.\\n-----------------\\nThere are many grouping scenarios; let us start with 1 boy, 1 boy, 1 boy, 2 boys, 5 boys.\\n\\nWe know there are 13650 ways to pick a single boy for group 1.\\n\\nTo then pick a single boy for group 2 from the remaining children, there are 9*(11*10*9*8 / 1*2*3*4) = 9 * 330 = 2970 ways.\\n\\nIf a single boy is then selected for group 3, there are 8 * (7*6*5*4 / 1*2*3*4) = 8*35 = 280 ways.\\n\\nGroup 4 must have at least 2 boys.  There are 7 boys left, and we must choose 2 of them.  So there are 7*6/1*2 = 21 ways to choose those boys with the remaining girls.\\n\\nThe last group would have 5 boys.\\n\\nSo just for this one possible way of grouping - 1 boy, 1 boy, 1 boy, 2 boys, 5 boys, there are \\n13650 * 2970 * 280 * 21 * 1 = 238,378,140,000 ways to arrange them.\\n\\nTHIS MAY NOT BE THE CORRECT FIGURE FOR THIS GROUPING SCENARIO - THERE MAY BE DUPLICATES, IN WHICH CASE THIS FIGURE IS TOO HIGH.  I did not know how to remove them from the figure.  The 13650 is correct for the first, but then we need to look at how many ways are there to grab 4&1, 4&1, 3&2, 0&5 from the remaining children.\\n\\n\\nWe must also account for other grouping scenarios, such as 2, 2, 2, 2, 2 boys; 1,1,2,2,4 boys; 1,1,1,3,4 boys; 1,2,2,2,3 boys, and some others.  For each of these grouping possibilities, the above such calculations would have to be done.  The sum of all the grouping possibilities is the total.\\n\\nSo this is a very difficult counting problem.  I would think you should search for more tools from your professor/teacher, or book.  There may be some more advanced way of saving time rather than go through each grouping scenario one at a time; though that will give the correct answer.\n\nAnswer:",

Comprehensive knowledge of all systems of the body and diagnostic procedures enable the DC to thoroughly evaluate a patient, address disorders relating to the spine and determine the need for referral to another health care provider.\\n\\nDoctors of Chiropractic are primary health care providers.\\nAccording to the Center for Studies in Health Policy, \"The DC can provide all three levels of primary care interventions and therefore is a primary care provider, as are MDs and DOs. The doctor of chiropractic is a gatekeeper to the health care system and an independent practitioner who provides primary care services. The DC's office is a direct access portal of entry to the full scope of service.\"\\n\\nDoctors of Chiropractic are licensed in all 50 states.\\nDCs have been licensed and recognized for many decades in all states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico.\\n\\nChiropractic is recognized by governmental health care programs.\\nChiropractic is included in Medicare, Medicaid, Federal Employees Health Care Benefits Programs, Federal Workers' Compensation and all state workers' compensation programs. Chiropractic students are qualified to receive federal student loan assistance and DCs are authorized to be commissioned as health care officers in the U.S. Armed Forces.\\n\\nThe practice of chiropractic is based on sound scientific principles.\\nThe existence of the nervous system as the primary control mechanism of the body is an undisputed scientific fact. Its relationship with the spine is the focus of the practice of chiropractic. The spine develops in utero to provide two primary functions: (1) allow for freedom of movement and (2) house and protect the spinal cord. When the vertebrae of the spine become misaligned through trauma or repetitive injury, two major consequences will result: (1) the range of motion becomes limited and (2) spinal nerves emerging from the spinal cord are compromised. DCs use the term \"subluxation\" to describe such disruptions. Interruption of nerve flow can eventually lead to pain, disability, and an overall decrease in the quality of life. Conversely, the removal of that interference has been shown to have significant, lasting health benefits. Through the adjustment of the subluxation, the doctor of chiropractic endeavors to restore normal nerve expression. The body is then able to respond appropriately to any imbalance in the system, thus relieving symptoms and restoring health.\\n\\nDoctors of chiropractic provide effective, low-cost health care for a wide range of conditions.\\nStudies conducted according to the highest scientific standards and published by organizations not affiliated in any way with chiropractic institutions or associations continue to show the clinical appropriateness and effectiveness of chiropractic care. One of the most recent, funded by the Ontario Ministry of Health, stated emphatically that:\\n\\n\"On the evidence, particularly the most scientifically valid clinical studies, spinal manipulation applied by chiropractors is shown to be more effective than alternative treatments for low back pain...There would be highly significant cost savings if more management of low back pain was transferred from physician to chiropractors.\"\\n\\nThe doctor of chiropractic is an effective source of preventative and wellness care.\\nThe anatomical focus of the DC on the human spine has created the perception of the DC as just a \"back doctor.\" Although this perception is not entirely incorrect, it is very much incomplete. Doctors of chiropractic are a highly appropriate resource in matters of work-place safety, st\n\nAnswer:",

Make sure that the total is less than the ampere rating of the circuit breaker.  You should probably only use about 3/4 of the amperes the circuit breaker is rated for.  For example, a 20 Amp breaker should only be loaded with about 15 Amps.\\n\\nIf only the wattage of an appliance is given, divide the wattage by the voltage to obtain the amperes.  For example, a toaster may draw 1200 watts.  1200 watts / 120 V = 10 Amps.  A light bulb may draw 60 watts.  60 watts / 120 V = .5 Amps.\n\nAnswer:",

Is that a fact?\nAnswer: Hi Kevin\\n\\nHere are a few ideas on how to heal your condition.\\n\\nCause\\n\\nNutrient deficiencies, thyroid disorders, and stress can all contribute to epileptic seizures and must be screened for and addressed as part of a comprehensive treatment approach. Proper bowel movements two to three times a day are also important. If necessary, consider a bowel cleanse to restore healthy bowel function. \\n\\nPioneering holistic dentist Hal Huggins, D.D.S., has noted the improvement, and in some cases the complete disappearance of epilepsy symptoms after removing toxic dental amalgams. If you have such amalgams in your mouth, consider having them replaced by someone properly trained in Holistic Dentistry. \\n\\nCaution: If the individual's seizure does not stop within 5-10 minutes, seek immediate medical assistance. At the same time, be sure not to over-drug the patient, as medical drugs can actually trigger epilepsy due to their potential side effects.\\n\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nNatural Cures\\n\\nDiet: Individuals affected by epilepsy should eat a low-fat, low-carbohydrate diet, and eliminate fried foods, salt, sugar, meat, milk, and alcohol. For long-term care, they should follow a hypoglycemic diet (see Hypoglycemia), being sure to avoid artificial sweeteners, excessive refined carbohydrates, and caffeine. For epilepsy accompanied by sluggish bowels or constipation, also ensure that the diet is rich with fibrous foods. \\n\\nEmergency Techniques You Can Use When Someone Is Having A Seizure: Remain calm and move sharp objects away from the affected individual. Keep him or her from putting anything in the mouth, and loosen his or her clothing. If possible, put the person on the floor or bed and stay at the individual's side until the episode runs its course. \\n\\nHerbs: For petit mal epilepsy, take one teaspoon of skullcap tincture three times a day. \\n\\nHydrotherapy: Hydrotherapy is the application of water, ice, steam and hot and cold temperatures to maintain and restore health. Treatments include full body immersion, steam baths, saunas, sitz baths, colonic irrigation and the application of hot and/or cold compresses. Hydrotherapy is effective for treating a wide range of conditions and can easily be used in the home as part of a self-care program. Many Naturopathic Physicians, Physical Therapists and Day Spas use Hydrotherapy as part of treatment. I suggest several at-home hydrotherapy treatments. \\n\\nJuice Therapy: Drink a combination of celery, carrot, and lettuce juice three times a day.\\n\\nNutritional Supplementation: The following nutrients can help minimize symptoms of epilepsy: L-taurine and L-tyrosine amino acids (500 mg three times daily) along with an amino acid blend (two times daily); vitamin B complex and vitamins B3 (niacin), B5, B6 and B12; calcium; choline (start with 4 g daily and increase to 10-12 g within three months); dimethyl glycine (100 mg two times daily); magnesium; manganese; and zinc. Vitamin B complex injected intramuscularly may also be helpful.\\n\\nNote: Sometimes essential fatty acids aggravate symptoms, so consult with a nutritional expert to determine if this is the case.\\n\\nAlternative Professional Care\\nIf your symptoms persist despite the above measures, seek the help of a qualified health professional. The following professional care therapies have all been shown to be useful for treating and relieving the symptoms of epilepsy: Acupuncture, Ayurveda, Biofeedback Training, Bodywork, Chiropractic, Craniosacral Therapy, Detoxification Therapy, Environmental Medicine, Holistic Dentistry, Hypnotherapy, Magnetic Field Therapy, Meditation, Mind/Body Medicine, Naturopathic Medicine, Osteopathy, Reflexology, Traditional Chinese Medicine, and Yoga\\n\\nBest of health to you\\n\\nCheers\n\nAnswer:",

These thunderstorms often produce large hail, strong winds, and tornadoes. Tornadoes in the winter and early spring are often associated with strong, frontal systems that form in the Central States and move east. Occasionally, large outbreaks of tornadoes occur with this type of weather pattern. Several states may be affected by numerous severe thunderstorms and tornadoes.\\n \\nDuring the spring in the Central Plains, thunderstorms frequently develop along a \"dryline,\" which separates very warm, moist air to the east from hot, dry air to the west. Tornado-producing thunderstorms may form as the dryline moves east during the afternoon hours. \\nAlong the front range of the Rocky Mountains, in the Texas panhandle, and in the southern High Plains, thunderstorms frequently form as air near the ground flows \"upslope\" toward higher terrain. If other favorable conditions exist, these thunderstorms can produce tornadoes.\\n\\nTornadoes occasionally accompany tropical storms and hurricanes that move over land. Tornadoes are most common to the right and ahead of the path of the storm center as it comes onshore.\n\nAnswer:",

Please provide an example / location.\nAnswer: Geologists classify volcanoes in following ways:\\n\\nCinder cones are the simplest type of volcano. They are built from particles and blobs of congealed lava ejected from a single vent. As the gas-charged lava is blown violently into the air, it breaks into small fragments that solidify and fall as cinders around the vent to form a circular or oval cone. Most cinder cones have a bowl-shaped crater at the summit and rarely rise more than a thousand feet or so above their surroundings. Cinder cones are numerous in western North America as well as throughout other volcanic terrains of the world.\\n\\nSome of the Earth's grandest mountains are composite volcanoes--sometimes called stratovolcanoes. They are typically steep-sided, symmetrical cones of large dimension built of alternating layers of lava flows, volcanic ash, cinders, blocks, and bombs and may rise as much as 8,000 feet above their bases. Some of the most conspicuous and beautiful mountains in the world are composite volcanoes, including Mount Fuji in Japan, Mount Cotopaxi in Ecuador, Mount Shasta in California, Mount Hood in Oregon, and Mount St. Helens and Mount Rainier in Washington.\\n\\nShield volcanoes, the third type of volcano, are built almost entirely of fluid lava flows. Flow after flow pours out in all directions from a central summit vent, or group of vents, building a broad, gently sloping cone of flat, domical shape, with a profile much like that of a warrior's shield. They are built up slowly by the accretion of thousands of highly fluid lava flows called basalt lava that spread widely over great distances, and then cool as thin, gently dipping sheets. Lavas also commonly erupt from vents along fractures (rift zones) that develop on the flanks of the cone. Some of the largest volcanoes in the world are shield volcanoes. In northern California and Oregon, many shield volcanoes have diameters of 3 or 4 miles and heights of 1,500 to 2,000 feet. The Hawaiian Islands are composed of linear chains of these volcanoes including Kilauea and Mauna Loa on the island of Hawaii-- two of the world's most active volcanoes.\\n\\nVolcanic or lava domes are formed by relatively small, bulbous masses of lava too viscous to flow any great distance; consequently, on extrusion, the lava piles over and around its vent. A dome grows largely by expansion from within. As it grows its outer surface cools and hardens, then shatters, spilling loose fragments down its sides. Some domes form craggy knobs or spines over the volcanic vent, whereas others form short, steep-sided lava flows known as \"coulees.\" Volcanic domes commonly occur within the craters or on the flanks of large composite volcanoes. The nearly circular Novarupta Dome that formed during the 1912 eruption of Katmai Volcano, Alaska, measures 800 feet across and 200 feet high.\n\nAnswer:",

Each weight weighs half a pound and can hold 99 and a half pounds of sand. How much sand must you fill in each weight so that you can measure any weight from 1 to 100 pounds if you can put weights on either side of the scale?\\n\\nAll weights are integers, so you can't have 1 and a half pounds.\\n\\nFirst person with the correct answer gets 10 points.\nAnswer: If I'm reading your half pound rule right, the weights (with the metal included) would be:\\n1, 3, 9, 27, and 81.\\nIn other words, you should put in the following amounts of sand:\\n0.5, 2.5, 8.5, 26.5, and 80.5.\\n\\nHere is the reason for it, though I'm not really sure how to write things like summation and subscripts here.  I will write a subscript in a square bracket.\\n\\nObviously we can use all possible sums of these weights to balance out our desired weight on the other side of the scale - weights of 1, 3, and 7 give values of 1, 3, 7, 1+3=7, 1+7=8, 1+3+7=11.  But we can also use all possible differences.  For example, if you had an 8 pound weight and a 3 pound weight, you could measure 5 pounds by putting the 3 and 8 pound weights on opposite sides.  Then you could measure some 5 pound object by putting it on the 3 pound side.\\n\\nLet x[0]...x[n] be the value of n weights (metal included).  In this case n=4 because we go from 0-4.  For simplicity in writing, define y[i] = x[0]+...+x[i] for any i.  The maximum amount we can balance on the scale using the weights x[0]...x[n] is y[n], by putting all weights on one side.  We need to find x[0]...x[n] such that for a given m up to y[n], we can add or subtract members of {x[0]...x[n]} to reach m.\\n\\nNow we prove this by induction.\\nWe propose that x[n+1] = 2*y[n]+1 satisfies our desired property.\\nDefine x[0]=1.  Then y[0]=1, so x[1]=2*1+1=3.  This satisfies our property because y[1]=3+1=4.  Clearly 1 and 3 can be weighed.  3-1=2 and 3+1=4, so we can reach all numbers up to 4=y[1].\\nNow suppose you have x[0]...x[n] with this property.  So any number up to y[n] can be made by sums and differences of x[0]...x[n].\\nNow we include x[n+1]=2*y[n]+1.\\nYou can still get from 1 to y[n] by just not using weight #n+1, since the property holds true for x[n].\\nBy putting weight #n+1 on the lighter side of any of the y[n] combinations, you can get\\nall values from x[n+1] down to x[n+1]-y[n] = 2*y[n]+1-y[n] = y[n]+1.\\nBy putting weight #n+1 on the heavier side of any of the y[n] combinations, you can get\\nall values from x[n+1] up to x[n+1]+y[n] = x[n+1]+x[n]+x[n-1]+...+x[0] = y[n+1].\\nSo with our choice of x[n+1] we can get all values from 1 to y[n+1].\\nIn other words, our property holds true for x[n+1].\\nBy induction, the property holds true for all x[n].\\nUsing the formula to calculate the first 5 values, you get 1, 3, 9, 27, 81 - the powers of 3.\n\nAnswer:",

The game quickly spread to other Ivy League colleges.\\n\\nEncouraged by Yale University's Walter Camp, the schools began to adopt rules that would differentiate American football from rugby in the 1880s. The scrimmage was introduced in 1880 and the system of downs in 1882.\\n\\nBy the turn of the 20th century, football had become notoriously dangerous; 18 college players died in 1905 alone. Colleges responded with a series of rule changes to open up the game, most importantly the forward pass, along with outlawing dangerous formations such as the \"flying wedge\", and introducing and requiring better equipment such as helmets.\\n\\nThe game had achieved its modern form by 1912, when the field was changed to its current size, the value of a touchdown increased to 6 points, and a fourth down added to each possession. Originally dominated by the Ivy League, football soon captured the interest of colleges nationwide. By 1916, when the Rose Bowl game matching eastern and western teams became an annual event, football had developed a national following second only to baseball among team sports.\\n\\nProfessional football developed in the mill towns of Pennsylvania and the American Midwest in the early years of the 20th century. The NFL was founded in 1920 in Canton, Ohio. Professional football remained a largely regional sport of secondary importance until after World War II. Television broadcasts greatly enhanced NFL football's national appeal, and the pro game surpassed both college football and baseball in popularity in the 1960s. The first Super Bowl\u2014between the champions of the NFL and the rival American Football League\u2014was played in 1967, and the two leagues merged in 1970.\n\nAnswer:",

At the moment past 6 the minute hand traveling downwards will have a increase of speed of x% every minute due to gravity. At 6:15 the speed of the minute minute hand will be of constant speed until 6:30. Since the hour hand at 6 is traveling upwards against gravity, its motion will be slowed by y% every hour until 9:00. After 9 the hand will have a constant speed until midnight. If clock B is place in a weightless enviroment, the minute and hour hand will perfectly match each other some time after 6 o clock. The hands of clock A will do the same, although at a different time. In terms of x and y, the absolute difference in times when this will happen is what?\nAnswer: This seems really dumb, because clocks do not change speed because of gravity.  Even if they were, their acceleration would be different at different times, not first constant and then zero like in your question.  But if you really need an answer...\\n\\nThe hands of the clock that are not affected by gravity will meet between 6:30 and 6:35.  To find when, we have to look at the angles of the hands.\\n\\nAssume t counts, in minutes, from 6:00.\\nh(t) = 180 + t/60*15 degrees, or 180 + t/4\\nm(t) = t/60*360 degrees, or 6t\\n180 + t/4 = 6t\\n(6 - 1/4)t = 180\\nt = 180/5.75 = 720/23 = about 31.30 min, or 31:18.  This is when the hands of the clock not affected by gravity will meet.\\n\\nNow for clock A.  The rate of acceleration is xv(t), so we know that v' = xv.  This is an ordinary linear differential equation.  Rewrite it as v' - xv = 0.  The characteristic equation is \u03bb - x = 0.\\nThe zero of the characteristic equation occurrs when \u03bb = x, so the basis for the solution is e^(xt).  So,\\nv(t) = ce^(xt)\\n\\nThe initial velocity is 360\u00ba/hour = 6\u00ba/min, so v(t = 0) = 6 = ce^0 => c = 6.\\n\\nFor the minute hand, until time t=15, v(t) = 6e^(xt).  Integrate this to find the position and convert from radians to degrees...\\nm(t) = (6/x)e^(xt) * (\u03c0/180) = (\u03c0 / 30x) e^(xt)\\n\\nSolve for t=15:\\nv(15) = 6e^(15x)\\nm(15) = (\u03c0 / 30x) e^(15x)\\n\\nFor all time t>15, v(t) is constant.  Integrate:\\nm(t) = 6t e^(15x) + c\\n\\nKnowing that m(15) = (\u03c0 / 30x) e^(15x),\\n(\u03c0 / 30x) e^(15x) = 6*15 e^(15x) + c\\nc = (\u03c0 / 30x - 90) e^(15x)\\n\\nSo for time t>15 min,\\nm(t) = (6t + \u03c0 / 30x - 90) e^(15x) \u00ba\\n\\nFor the hour hand, the initial velocity is 1/4\u00ba per minute.  The acceleration is -yv, which gives v' = -yv.  Rewrite as v' + yv = 0.  The characteristic equation is \u03bb + y = 0.  The zero occurrs when \u03bb = -y.  The basis for the solution is e^(-yt).\\nv(t) = ce^(-yt)\\nv(0) = 1/4 = ce^0 => c = 1/4\\n\\nSo for the hour hand, v(t) = 1/4 e^(-yt).  The hands will meet before 9:00, so we do not have to worry about the condition when the hour hand stops decelerating.\\n\\nIntegrate to find the position:\\nh(t) = 1/(-4y) e^(-yt) + c\\nh(t = 0) = 180\u00ba = -1/(4y) e^0 + c\\nc = 180 + 1/(4y)\\n\\nSo,\\nh(t) = 180 + [1 - e^(-yt)]/(4y)\\nFrom above,\\nm(t) = [6t + \u03c0/(30x) - 90]e^(15x)\\n\\nSet them equal and solve for t.  I think YOU can handle that.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAbout the acceleration being constant:  Yes, the acceleration due  to gravity is a constant, however, it is acting upon the arm's centre of mass, which is rotating about the fixed end.  The constant force due to gravity acts straight down.  However, if you break the gravitational force into orthagonal components parallel and normal to the arm, only the normal component generates torque, and torque is what accelerates the arm.  The normal component varies as the sine of the angle at which the arm is pointing, hence the torque will vary and so will the acceleration of the arm.  I took statics; I know what I am talking about.\\n\\nIs this a homework problem, or did you make it up?\n\nAnswer:",

Typically, a student-athlete has four years of eligibility in a given sport, to coincide with the standard four-year calendar for obtaining a bachelor's degree. For various reasons, some student-athletes opt to not compete with the team for their first year attending a university but to only attend classes and practices with the team; this process is known as redshirting. The student-athlete does not use one of his or her four years of eligibility in that season. Using this mechanism, a student-athlete has up to five academic years to use the four years of eligibility, thus creating the phenomenon of \"Fifth Year Seniors\". However, each student-athlete has at most four years of actual competition with the varsity team.\\n\\nThe term is often used as a verb: a coach may choose to redshirt a player, who is redshirted and will be redshirting that year.\\n\\n\\n[edit] Reasons\\nThere are multiple reasons a student-athlete may redshirt. A student-athlete may redshirt to gain a year of practice with the team prior to participating in competition. In football, a student-athlete may redshirt to add size prior to participating since football tends to favor larger players. Since the college years coincide with the typical completion of physical maturity, using a year of eligibility in the fifth college year is generally more beneficial to the team and to the student-athlete's potential professional prospects than it is to use the same year of eligibility in the first college year. Commonly, an athlete will redshirt the first year of college, if the athlete is redshirting at all.\\n\\nAn athlete may be asked to redshirt if he or she would have no opportunity to play as an academic freshman. This is a common occurrence in many sports where there is already an established starter or too much depth at the position in which the freshman in question is planning to play.\\n\\nThere is also a medical redshirt that may be obtained to replace a season lost to injury. A medical redshirt can be granted by the governing body for a season lost completely or almost completely to injury. A medical redshirt can allow a player to gain additional eligibility beyond the standard four academic calendar years.\\n\\nThe term redshirt freshman indicates an academic sophomore (second-year student) who is in the first season of athletic eligibility. A redshirt freshman is distinguished from a true freshman (first-year student) as one who has practiced with the team for the prior season. The term redshirt sophomore is also commonly used to indicate an academic junior (third-year student) who is in the second season of athletic eligibility.\n\nAnswer:",

Why isn't there clear-cut proof that God exists? What evidence have you got, or anyone else, that suggests he exists? The Bible is just a storybook that people wrote, much like an Enid Blighton book!

Post credible source.?\nAnswer: (taken directly from Wikipedia; words within < > are linked under sources):\\n\\nThe Constitution does not specify the size of the Supreme Court; instead, Congress has the power to fix the number of Justices. Originally, the total number of Justices was set at six by the <Judiciary Act of 1789>. As the country grew geographically, the number of Justices steadily increased. The court was expanded to seven members in 1807, nine in 1837 and ten in 1863. \\n\\nIn 1866, however, Congress wished to deny President Andrew Johnson any Supreme Court appointments, and therefore passed the <Judicial Circuits Act>, which provided that the next three Justices to retire would not be replaced; thus, the size of the Court would eventually reach seven by attrition. Consequently, one seat was removed in 1866 and a second in 1867. By the <Circuit Judges Act of 1869>, the number of Justices was again set at nine (the Chief Justice and eight Associate Justices), where it has remained ever since. \\n\\nINTERESTING NOTE: President Franklin D. Roosevelt attempted to expand the Court (see Judiciary Reorganization Bill of 1937); his plan would have allowed the President to appoint one new, additional justice for every justice who reached the age of seventy but did not retire from the bench, until the Court reached a maximum size of fifteen justices. Ostensibly, this was to ease the burdens of the docket on the elderly judges, but it was widely believed that the President's actual purpose was to add Justices who would favor his New Deal policies, which had been regularly ruled unconstitutional by the Court. The plan failed in Congress and the court changed course (see the switch in time that saved nine). In any case, Roosevelt's long tenure in the White House allowed him to appoint a large number of Justices.\n\nAnswer:",

Turn the other cheek, give the thief your coat too, etc. \\nIt seems to me that Jesus wants us to worry more about leading people to him and building wealth in heaven than our worldly wealth and station.\\nThoughts?\nAnswer: We can defend ourselves. A little known fact for those who haven't actually studied the Bible is this: The eye for an eye rule was actually put in place for the protection of the criminal. For example, if they cut off your hand you cannot kill them for it. You were only allowed to cut off their right hand.\\nYou are correct in saying that Jesus wants us to focus on leading people to him and building treasure in heaven not earth.\\n\\nThe verse you used came from Matthew 5:38. \\n\"You have heard that it was said, 'Eye for eye, and tooth for tooth.'  But I tell you, do not resist an evil person. If anyone slaps you on the right cheek, turn to them the other cheek also. And if anyone wants to sue you and take your shirt, hand over your coat as well. If anyone forces you to go one mile, go with them two miles. Give to the one who asks you, and do not turn away from the one who wants to borrow from you.\n\nAnswer:",

The problem was that salicylic acid was tough on stomachs and a means of 'buffering' the compound was searched for. The first person to do so was a French chemist named Charles Frederic Gerhardt. In 1853, Gerhardt neutralized salicylic acid by buffering it with sodium (sodium salicylate) and acetyl chloride, creating acetylsalicylic acid. Gerhardt's product worked but he had no desire to market it and abandoned his discovery. \\n\\nIn 1899, a German chemist named Felix Hoffmann, who worked for a German company called Bayer, rediscovered Gerhardt's formula. Felix Hoffmann made some of the formula and gave it to his father who was suffering from the pain of arthritis. With good results, Felix Hoffmann then convinced Bayer to market the new wonder drug. Aspirin was patented on March 6, 1889. \\n\\nThe folks at Bayer came up with the name Aspirin, it comes from the 'A\" in acetyl chloride, the \"spir\" in spiraea ulmaria (the plant they derived the salicylic acid from) and the 'in' was a then familiar name ending for medicines. \\n\\nAspirin was first sold as a powder. In 1915, the first Aspirin tablets were made. Interestingly, Aspirin \u00ae and Heroin \u00ae were once trademarks belonging to Bayer. After Germany lost World War I, Bayer was forced to give up both trademarks as part of the Treaty of Versailles in 1919.\n\nAnswer:",

He became famous by showing others how to become successful. His book How to Win Friends and Influence People (1936) has sold more than 10 million copies and has been translated into many languages. His books became popular because of his illustrative stories and simple, well-phrased rules.

Toward the beginning of his career, Carnegie wrote Public Speaking and Influencing Men in Business (1931), which became a standard text.\\n\\nCarnegie attended Warrensburg (Mo.) State Teachers College, and became a salesman for Armour and Company. Later, he taught public speaking to businessmen.

Like it's rules etc??\nQuestion: I want to know more about this sport. Like it'srules, how's it played, which countries play it etc. I would be greateful if someone could give some pictures too. I wouldn't mind links also...\nAnswer: Cricket is a team sport played between two teams of eleven players each. It is a bat-and-ball game played on a roughly oval grass field, in the centre of which is a flat strip of ground 20.12 m (22 yards) long, called a pitch. At each end of the pitch is a set of wooden stumps, called a wicket. Note that, rather confusingly, the pitch itself is also often referred to as the wicket. A player from the fielding team (the bowler) propels a hard, fist-sized cork-centred leather ball from one wicket towards the other. The ball usually bounces once before reaching a player from the opposing team (the batsman), who defends the wicket from the ball with a wooden cricket bat. Another batsman (the \"non-striker\") stands in an inactive role near the bowler's wicket.\\n\\nGenerally, the batsman attempts to strike the ball with the bat and run to the other end of the pitch, exchanging places with his partner, scoring a run. However, he can attempt to run without hitting the ball, and vice versa. While the batting team scores as many runs as it can, the bowling team returns the ball to either wicket. If the ball strikes a wicket with enough force to knock a bail off before the batsman nearer to that wicket has reached safety, then the batsman is out, or \"dismissed\" - this is also known as a wicket. The batsman can also be out in a number of other ways, such as failing to stop the bowled ball from knocking the bails off, or if a fielder catches the ball before it touches the ground. Once the batsmen are not attempting to score any more runs, the ball is \"dead\" and is bowled again.\\n\\nOnce out, a batsman is replaced by the next batsman in the team. As there must always be two batsmen on the field, the team's innings ends when ten batsmen are out, and the teams exchange roles. The number of innings, and possible restrictions on the number of balls in each, depend on the type of game played. At the end of the match\u2014of which there are several definitions\u2014the team that has scored more runs wins. In first-class cricket, a draw can result if the team to bat last fails to match the required total before a time limit is reached or if the bowling teams fails to take 10 wickets. This can add interest to one-sided games by giving the team in the worse position an incentive to play for a draw. This is distinct from a tie, which results if scores are level at the completion of both teams' innings.\\n\\nCricket has been an established team sport for several centuries. It originated in its modern form in England and is popular mainly in the present and former members of the Commonwealth. In some countries in South Asia, including India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, and Sri Lanka, cricket is by far the most popular sport. Cricket is also a major sport in England and Wales, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, Zimbabwe and the English-speaking countries of the Caribbean, which are collectively known in cricketing parlance as the West Indies. There are also well established amateur club competitions in countries as diverse as the Netherlands, Kenya, Nepal, and Argentina (see also: International Cricket Council).\\n\\nThe length of the game \u2014 a match can last six or more hours a day for up to five days in one form of the game \u2014 the numerous intervals for lunch and tea and the rich terminology are notable aspects that can often confuse those not familiar with the sport. For its fans, the sport and the intense rivalries between top cricketing nations provide passionate entertainment and outstanding sporting achievements. It has even occasionally given rise to diplomatic outrage, the most notorious being the Basil D'Oliveira affair which led to the banning of South Africa from sporting events. Other examples include the Bodyline series played between England and Australia in the early 1930s, an event that almost meant diplomatic ties were severed with England or the 1981 underarm bowling incident involving Australia and New \n\nAnswer:",

Crook. Read it cover to cover! By the way: It does not just apply to women.  I have been there, so I sympathize, and I will tell you it is a long tough road. Candida thrives in an acidic environment.  The American Diet is 80% acidic, 20% alkaline typically.  In order to get healthy those percentages need to be turned to 20% acidic, 80% alkaline! What are acidic foods? All white flours and sugars, everything processed and made with corn syrup, dextrose, sucrose.  You have to AVOID these at all costs! What is alkaline? Healthy foods!  Fruits, veggies, meats, whole grains.  Candida thrives in an acidic environment.  What is the best cure?  FOUR THINGS:  WILD MOUNTAIN OREGANO OIL, LOTS OF FRESH CHOPPED GARLIC, AND GRAPEFRUIT SEED EXTRACT, and PH balance pills (VAXA makes these). Don't forget to drink plenty of pure water. WHILE TAKING THESE FOUR REMEDIES, MAKE SURE YOU EAT PLENTY OF ACIDOPHILIS (YOGURT, ACIDOPHILIS PILLS).  IT IS NEEDED TO REPLACE THE GOOD BACTERIA IN YOUR SYSTEM.  WHEN CANDIDA OCCURS, THE BAD BACTERIA HAS OVERTAKEN THE GOOD, CAUSING FAR REACHING PROBLEMS.  TIREDNESS, MOOD SWINGS, ALLERGIES, SKIN PROBLEMS, MEMORY LOSS, CHRONIC FATIGUE, THE LIST IS ENDLESS.  CANDIDA CAN ALSO MIMIC THE SYMPTOMS OF OTHER DISEASES.  It also does not disappear overnight.  Sometimes an individual does not see improvement for a few months, and will have die off symptoms before they feel better.  Stick with the restrictive diet, and remember when you cheat, the bad bacteria is allowed to grow again, because CANDIDA LIVES ON SUGAR (THE HERB STEVIA IS A LIFESAVER IF YOU NEED A SUGAR REPLACEMENT IT IS 300X SWEETER THAN SUGAR AND IS NATURAL) Stay away from Nutrasweet, saccharin, Splenda-these are all chemicals that will cause more problems!!  One more thing:  If you have Candida, chances are you have a parasite problem as well.  Be sure to do a parasite cleanse also.  Parasites can also cause far reaching problems.\n\nAnswer:",

This relationship states that: \\n\\nThe potential difference (voltage) across an ideal conductor is proportional to the current through it. \\n\\nThe constant of proportionality is called the \"resistance\" - R. \\n\\nOhm's Law is given by: \\n\\nV = I R\\n\\nwhere V is the potential difference between two points which include a resistance R. \\nI is the current flowing through the resistance. \\n\\nFor biological work, it is often preferable to use the conductance, g = 1/R; In this form Ohm's Law is: \\n\\nI = g V\\n\\nMaterial that obeys Ohm's Law is called \"ohmic\" or \"linear\"  because the potential difference across it varies linearly with the current.\n\nAnswer:",

The eroded volcanic islands are much like the oceanic, or volcanic, high islands, only they have been eroded to such a point that they are barely above sea level. Examples of these islands include the smaller, lower islands of Hawaii.\\n\\nAtolls are a series of islands that form a rough ring enclosing a central body of water called a lagoon. The various islets of the ring are called motus and are separated by sea channels that lead into the lagoon. An atoll is continually built upward from an underlying coral reef, itself formed from the skeleton of a tiny, lime-secreting animal called a polyp. Typically, some parts of an atoll are above sea level while other parts remain below. Many scientists believe that atolls were once the fringing reef around volcanic islands that have subsided below the ocean surface. In a subset of atolls, known as raised atolls, geologic action has elevated the coralline limestone above the surrounding sea. Nauru and Niue are examples of raised atolls. Examples of other atolls include most of the Marshalls, Kiribati, Tuvalu, Tokelau, and the Cook Islands. Although most atolls are tiny, some\u2014probably those that once surrounded large volcanic peaks\u2014are quite large. Kwajalein, in the Marshall Islands, is the world\u2019s largest atoll in terms of its diameter around the lagoon, with a length of 130 km (80 mi) and a width of 32 km (20 mi). Kwajalein\u2019s land area, however, is only 16 sq km (6 sq mi). Kiritimati, in Kiribati, is the largest atoll in terms of land area, with a total area of about 390 sq km (150 sq mi).\n\nAnswer:",

I didn't eat for the whole day except for soup, and everything was going well. I just ate a bunch of chips, a Lean Pocket, a sandwich, 4 strawberries, Chewy bar, a Hershey's kiss, and a piece of chocolate. I feel so sick! Can someone make me feel better?\nAnswer: The problem is when you try to starve your body you get really hungry and in the end over eat. Instead you should have 5 small meals a day. For the average women trying to lose weight they should stick to a 1600 calorie diet. .\\n\\nLosing weight first starts with being happy with yourself and loving *YOU* on the inside. Try everyday to smile and laugh, LAUGHING is super helpful. It seems weird but it really does help! =) Try to follow a 1600 calorie diet. \\nIt's best to have 5 meals a day that way you don't get to hungry because that leads to over eating. \\nHere is a couple ideas to help you get started:\\n\\nBreakfast: \\nOatmeal and a piece of wheat toast w/ 2tsp. trans free margarine. -OR- Strawberry Banana Smoothie (In a blender process until smooth, 1 small banana, 1/2 cup strawberries, 1/2 cup fat free milk, 1/2 cup low fat plain yogurt, 2 tsp. honey, and 1 or 2 ice3 cubes. You can have your smoothie with 1 or 2 pieces of whole wheat toast. -OR- An egg on a piece of wheat toast with salsa (make 2 servings) ---If you are still huingry at breakfast have a small piece of fruit. \\n\\nLunch:\\n1 cup soup (water based not cream base) and a Cheese and Tomato Sandwich: 2 slices whole wheat bread, 2 slices reduced fat cheese, mustard and sliced tomato. -OR_ instead of the tomato sandwich 2 pieces whole wheat with 2 slices of Turkey and Mustard. -OR- A Lean Cuisine Frozen Meal (These are actually very tasty. The meat is delicious. \\n\\nDinner: 1 piece Chicken Breast with 2 side dishes: 1 cup steamed veggies, 1 sweet potato, 3/4 cup corn, 3/4 cup butternut squash, etc.\\n\\nDessert:\\nLight Ice Cream or Frozen Yogurt:\\n3/4 cup with no more than 110 calories per 1/2 cup topped with tablespoon chocalate syrup. \\n\\nSnacks:\\nSteamed Veggies, fruit, any nuts (these are great protein), \\nmy personal favorite snack is Light and Fit 60 calorie yogurt cup with a 100 calorie Granola Bar. (I cruch up the Granola Bar and put it inside of my yogurt.)\\nAlso there are alot of great ideas if you go to fast food for example.... \\n\\n\\nWendys: Ultimate Chicken Grill Sandwich- 390 calories\\n\\nMcDonalds:\\nCaesar Salad grilled Chicken-220 calories\\nBacon Ranch Salad w/grilled chicken 260 calories\\nSalad Dressing: Vinaigrette: 40 calories\\nSalad Dressing: Italian : 60 calories\\nFruit and yogurt Parfait: 160 calories\\nChicken McNuggets: (4) 170 cal.

They're delicious just No MAyo. My favorite is Sweet Onion Chicken Teriyaki. I like to get a foot long and have a 6' for lunch and a 6' for dinner.\\n\\nAlso make sure you do 30 minutes of excercise 5 days a week. I like to walk to the store and back instead of drive =)\\n\\nThis was just some ideas to help you on your way. \\n\\nAlso its great to drink one glass of water before eating. Water is very important! It takes your body 30 minutes to tell your brain you're full so sometimes after you eat a small meal wait 30 minutes to see if you are still hungry or not.\\n\\n\\nGOOD LUCK!!!

Suppose you choose a marble at random, and do not replace it. Then you choose a second marble. Find the probability of each event.\\n\\n1. You select a green marble then a white marble.\\n\\n2. Both of the marbles you select are green.\nAnswer: Okay...this may get a little confusing. :) \\n\\nThe first thing that you need to do is figure out whether the two event listed in each number are independent of each other or dependent.  In this case, the events are dependent.  For example, if you have these 8 marbles in a bag and you pick a green marble out of it...without replacement you would just set that green marble aside.  Now the chances of getting a green or white marble are different because you have changed the total number, does that make sense?\\n\\nNow, because the events (let's just work with number 1 for example but the same thing can be done to number 2) are dependent, you must use the multiplication rule.  In math terms this says that \"The chance that two things both happen equals the chance that the first happens multiplied by the chance that the second happens pretending the first has happened\".  In simpler terms this just means that you take the chance that the first will happen and multiply it by the chance that the second thing will happen.  \\n\\nSo in number 1, the first one you select is a green marble and the second one is a white marble.  The chances of getting the green marble are 3/8 because there are 3 green marbles and 8 marbles all together.  The chances of getting the white marble second are 5/7.  There are 5 white marbles in the bag, but because you have already taken the green marble out you have changed the total number of marbles - hence the 8 in the denominator changes to a 7...does that make sense?\\n\\nSo your answer to the first one would be (3/8 x 5/7).  I'm not for sure what the numerical answer to that would be, but you can do that calculation on your own! :) \\n\\nThe second problem can be done the same way, except instead of having a white marble second you would have another green marble.\\n\\nI really hope that this helps!! :) :) Good luck! :D\n\nAnswer:",

Kelly ET AL.supreme court case. \\nArgued October 13, 1969\\nDecided March 23, 1970\\n I am a student studying law and my assignment is to tell what happened in this case and why. please help.\nAnswer: It was basically about due process.\\n\\nSomeone was receiving welfare, but then the state decided that he was no longer eligible and told him that the payments would stop.  He said, wait a minute, if you let me explain the circumstances, you'd see that I'm still eligible (it is called a \"hearing\" when someone is allowed to come in and tell their side of the story).  The state said, fine, you can come tell us about the situation (we'll give you a \"hearing\"), but first we are going to terminate the payments.  If, after hearing your side of the story, we think you are still eligible, then we will start making the payments again. SO THE STATE OFFERED HIM A POST-TERMINATION HEARING.\\n\\nThe guy thought that he should get a PRE-TERMINATION hearing, and that the welfare payments shouldn't be stopped BEFORE he was able to explain his side of the story.  So he sued the state.\\n\\nThe state argued that it would be too expensive and time consuming to give all welfare recipients a pre-termination hearing.\\n\\nThe case went all the way to the Supreme Court.  The Supreme Court decided that it was unfair to terminate the payments without first hearing the guy's explanation of why he was still eligible.  The court said WELFARE RECIPIENTS MUST BE ALLOWED A PRE-TERMINATION \"HEARING\" BEFORE THEIR PAYMENTS ARE CUT OFF.\\n\\nWhy?  In the words of the court: \"The interest of the eligible recipient in the uninterrupted receipt of public assistance, which provides him with essential food, clothing, housing, and medical care, coupled with the State's interest that his payments not be erroneously terminated, clearly outweighs the State's competing concern to prevent any increase in its fiscal and administrative burdens.\"\\n\\nWhat \"vocab\" don't you understand?\n\nAnswer:",

It is only a BAD HABIT that could be broken with a simple Executive Order. \\n\\nAccording to estimates, some 200,000 so-called anchor babies are born in the United States every year. \\nOnce a mother has birthed a child on American soil, she can then seek to obtain citizenship for herself on the strength of the family-reunification laws. \\nEven before this happens, she is very hard to deport, as the mother of an American, and the full panoply of welfare benefits is available to her, \\nas is affirmative action if she is a member of a racial minority. \\nA group of attorneys and immigration experts are trying to do something about the problem. \\nCraig Nelsen, director of Friends of Immigration Law Enforcement: \"The situation we have today is absurd,There is a huge and growing industry in Asia that arranges tourist visas for pregnant women so they can fly to the United States and give birth to an American. This was not the intent of the Fourteenth Amendment; it makes a mockery of citizenship.\"\\n\\nThe key to undoing the current misinterpretation of the Fourteenth Amendment is this odd phrase\\n \\n\"AND SUBJECT TO THE JURISDICTION THEREOF.\"\\n \\nThe whole problem is caused by the fact that the meaning of this phrase, which was clear to anyone versed in legal language in 1868, \\nhas slipped with changes in usage. Fortunately, there is a large group of court precedents that make clear what the phrase actually means: \\n\\nThe Fourteenth Amendment EXCLUDES the children of aliens. (The Slaughterhouse Cases (83 U.S. 36 (1873)) \\n\\nThe Fourteenth Amendment draws a distinction between the children of aliens and children of citizens. (Minor v. Happersett (88 U.S. 162 (1874)) \\nThe phrase \"subject to the jurisdiction\" requires \"direct and immediate allegiance\" to the United States, not just physical presence. \\n(Elk v. Wilkins 112 U.S. 94 (1884)) \\n\\nThere is NO automatic birthright citizenship in a particular case. (Wong Kim Ark Case, 169 U.S. 649 (1898)) \\n\\nThe Supreme Court has NEVER confirmed birthright citizenship for the children of illegal aliens, temporary workers, and tourists. \\n(Plyler v. Doe, 457 U.S. 202, 211 n.10 (1982)) \\n\\nThere are other cases referring to minor details of the question.\\n\\nthe so-called 14th amendment was never properly ratified either. \\nIn the case of Dyett v. Turner, 439 P.2d 266, 270 (1968), \\nthe Utah Supreme Court recited numerous historical facts proving, \\nbeyond any shadow of a doubt, that the so-called 14th amendment was likewise a major fraud upon the American People.\\n\\nThose facts, in many cases, were Acts of the several State Legislatures voting for or against that proposal to amend the U.S. Constitution. \\nThe Supreme Law Library has a collection of references detailing this major fraud.\\n\\nThe U.S. Constitution requires that constitutional amendments be ratified by three-fourths of the several States.\\n As such, their Acts are governed by the Full Faith and Credit Clause in the U.S. Constitution. See Article IV, Section 1.\\n\\nJudging by the sheer amount of litigation its various sections have generated, \\nparticularly Section 1, the so-called 14th amendment is one of the worst pieces of legislation ever written in American history. \\nThe phrase \u201csubject to the jurisdiction of the United States\u201d is properly understood to mean \u201csubject to the municipal jurisdiction of Congress.\u201d \\n\\nFor this one reason alone, the Congressional Resolution proposing the so-called 14th amendment is provably vague and t\n\nAnswer:",

Are there any other fruit that have seeds on the outside?\nQuestion: I cannot think of any fruit that have their seeds outside the edible flesh. Is there any scientific explanation as to why this is? Are there any other fruit that have their seeds on the outside??\nAnswer: What most people call seeds on the outside of the strawberry fruit are actually\\nthe true fruits. Technically, they are achenes. In an achene, the single seed is\\nenclosed by the ovary wall. A sunflower fruit is also an achene.\\n\\nA strawberry \"fruit\" is unusual because the red, fleshy part is the enlarged\\nreceptacle. The receptacle is the enlarged tip of the flowering stem to which\\nthe petals, sepals, stamens and carpels are attached. The strawberry is said to\\nhave an accessory fruit because much tissue other than the ovary is part of the\\n\"fruit\". Apples and pineapples are also accessory fruits.\\n\\nThe strawberry is also termed an aggregate fruit because it is formed from many\\nseparate carpels of a single flower. Other aggregate fruits are raspberry and\\nblackberry. \\n\\nSome people mistakenly refer to strawberries as a multiple fruit. In a multiple\\nfruit, the carpels of several flowers merge to form the fruit. Pineapple and\\nfigs are multiple fruits.\n\nAnswer:",

Born in 1881, in the early 1900s, he came to believe the Ottoman Empire was in need of radical reform.  He joined forces with two other 'Young Turks' (a group of army officers who wanted to modernise the administration of the Ottoman Empire).  As a result of the rebellion, the incumbent Sultan, Abdul Hamid, was deposed in 1909.\\n\\nOn the outbreak of the First World War in 1914, Pasha (having aligned himself with Germany and Austria-Hungary) became Minister for War and when Turkey was defeated in 1918, he fled to Turkestan.\\n\\nEnver Pasha died in 1922 at the age of 41, whilst leading an anti-Bolshevik revolt in Turkestan.\n\nAnswer:",

It does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud. It is not rude, it is not self-seeking, it is not easily angered, it keeps no record of wrongs. Love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth. It always protects, always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres. Love never fails.\n\nAnswer:",

The dodo was a flightless member of the pigeon family. Fully grown dodos weighted about 23 kg (50 pounds). Around 1505 the Portuguese became the first Europeans to discover the dodo. By 1681 it had been driven to extinction by humans and the feral dogs, pigs, rats, and monkeys introduced by Europeans to Mauritius. The dodo was not the only Mauritian bird driven to extinction in recent centuries. Of the 45 bird species originally found, only 21 still survive. Two bird species closely related to the dodo also became extinct: the Reunion solitaire by 1746, and the Rodrigues solitaire by 1790. Reports of sightings of living dodos in the 1990s on Mauritius prompted William J. Gibbons to mount expeditions to search for them. None were found.\n\nAnswer:",

A graph of lnKsp against 1/T is plotted.  The slope is (-delta H degrees)/(R) and the intercept will be (delta S degrees)/ (delta G).  Delta G degrees can then be determined at any temperature of  interest.  \\n\\nThe graph of my information gives me a slope of -5348.5 and a y-intercept of 12.614.  \\n\\nHow is the graph used to evaluate delta H?\nAnswer: R is the gas constant (= 8.31 J/mol*K).  The value should be with the list of constants in your book.\\n\\nOk Nic, you seem to be a bit confused on this issue so lets go back and start from scratch.\\n\\nFirst you obtained you values for T and K (experimentally or otherwise).  MAKE SURE YOU CONVERT YOUR TEMP VALUES TO KELVIN.  It's important for the units of the constant (R) are in Kelvin.  So then you calculate 1/T and lnK and plot the values for each set to generate your graph.\\n\\nYou calculate slope by taking two of your points (x1,y1) and (x2,y2).  From the data you added, let's say we'll use your first (0.002976, -3.079) and last points (0.003165, -4.225).\\n\\nslope= [-4.225- (-3.079)]/[0.003165-0.002976]= -6063.49 kelvin\\n\\nSince slope = -delta H/R\\nThen -delta H = slope * R\\nSo -delta H = -6063.49kelvin * 8.31 J/molkelvin\\nAnd -delta H= -50387.62 J/mol\\nRemoving the negatives from both sides\\nDelta H= 50387.62 J/mol\\n\\nFor the second part of the question, use one (x,y) experimental point to find the y-intercept.  They don't want you to determine it from your plot, they want you to calculate the exact value.\\n\\nThe equation of a line is y=mx+b where \"m\" is the slope and \"b\" is the intercept.  So take another experimental point from readings (ie 0.003012, -3.751) and calculate the intercept by using the slope value calculated above.\\n\\nIf y=mx+b, then b= y-mx\\nPlugging in the values\\nb= -3.751 - (-6063.49kelvin * 0.003012/kelvin)\\nb= -3.751 - (-18.26)\\nb= 14.51\\n\\nTo calculate delta S for that same point (for that's what is requested), first you have to calculate delta G for that point.  Use the  following equation;\\n\\ndelta G = -RTlnK\\n\\nYou know the value for R (8.31 J/molkelvin), and you have the temp value and lnK value for that point for it was expermientally determined\\n\\n1/T= 0.003012/kelvin so T=332.01 kelvin\\nlnK= -3.751\\n\\nSo delta G= -8.31 J/molkelvin * 332.01 kelvin * -3.751\\nand delta G = 10349.02 J/mol\\n\\nYou can then calculate delta S for\\nintercept = delta S/ delta G (given in your original data)\\n\\nTherefore delta S = intercept * delta G\\nSo delta S = 14.51 * 10349.02 J/mol = 150164.28 J/mol\\n\\nHope this clarifies things.\n\nAnswer:",

Light is split up into the following colours with the first having the longest wavelenght and the last having the shortest. \\n\\nRed\\nOrange\\nYellow\\nGreen\\nBlue\\nIndico\\nViolet\\n\\nAn easy way to rememeber this is ROY G BIV (my year 12 geology teacher taught me that about 8 years ago)\\n\\nAs light moves through the atmosphere, most of the longer wavelengths are able to pass straight through. Little of the red, orange and yellow light is affected by the air. However, much of the shorter wavelength light is absorbed by the gas molecules in the atmosphere which is mainly nitrogen (78%) and oxygen (21%). The absorbed blue light is then scattered in all different directions. Since you see the blue light from everywhere overhead, the sky looks blue. \\n\\nOn Earth, the sun appears yellow. If you were out in space, or on the moon, the sun would look white. In space, there is no atmosphere to scatter the sun's light. On Earth, some of the shorter wavelength light (the blues and violets) are removed from the direct rays of the sun by scattering. The remaining colors together appear yellow. \\n\\nYou didnt ask about sunsets, but what the heck :)\\n\\nWhat happens during sunsets is that as the sun begins to go down, the light must travel farther through the atmosphere before it gets to you. More of the light is reflected and scattered. As less light reaches you directly, the sun appears less bright. The color of the sun itself appears to change, first to orange and then to red. This is because even more of the short wavelength blues and greens are now scattered. Only the longer wavelengths are left in the direct beam that reaches your eyes. \\n\\nThe second part of the your question is a lot easier. The sky is black simply  because of the lack of light from the sun going through the atmosphere. If there are no colours from the spectrum to get absorbed then the only thing that is left is the blackness of the sky.\n\nAnswer:",

For it is obvious that if a man enters the starting line of a race three hundred years after another man, the second would have to perform some incredible feat in order to catch up.\" \\n\"A society that has done something special against the Negro for hundreds of years must now do something special for him, to equip him to compete on a just and equal basis.\" \\n\"... for 15 centuries the Negro was enslaved and robbed of any wages \u2014 potential accrued wealth which would have been the legacy of his descendants. All of America's wealth today could not adequately compensate its Negroes for his centuries of exploitation and humiliation. It is an economic fact that a program such as I propose would certainly cost far less than any computation of two centuries of unpaid wages plus accumulated interest. In any case, I do not intend that this program of economic aid should apply only to the Negro: it should benefit the disadvantaged of all races.\" \\n\\n\\nHere what he said about America\\n\"Don't let anybody make you think God chose America as his divine messianic force to be a sort of policeman of the whole world. God has a way of standing before the nations with justice and it seems I can hear God saying to America \"you are too arrogant, and if you don't change your ways, I will rise up and break the backbone of your power, and I will place it in the hands of a nation that doesn't even know my name. Be still and know that I'm God.\"\n\nAnswer:",

At 11, the media was mistakenly informed that the hostages had been saved and the news was announced to a relieved Israeli public. Almost an hour later, however, new fighting broke out and one of the helicopters holding the Israelis was blown up by a terrorist grenade. The remaining hostages in the second helicopter were shot to death by one of the surviving terrorists.\\n\\nAt 3 a.m., a drawn and teary-eyed Jim McKay, who had been reporting the drama throughout the day as part of ABC's Olympic coverage, announced: \"They're all gone.\"\\n\\nFive of the terrorists were killed along with one policeman, and three were captured. A little over a month later, on Oct. 29, a Lufthansa jet was hijacked by terrorists demanding that the Munich killers be released.\\n\\nThe Germans capitulated and the terrorists were let go, but an Israeli assassination squad was assigned to track them down along with those responsible for planning the massacre. According to George Jonas in Vengeance: The True Story of an Israeli Counter-Terrorist Team, eight of the 11 men targeted for death were killed. Of the remaining three, one died of natural causes and the other two were assassinated, but it is not known for sure if they were killed by Israeli agents.\n\nAnswer:",

I want to know if blood composition deteriorates with ages of the diseases.\nAnswer: Men under 50 years old: less than 15 mm/hr.\\nMen over 50 years old: less than 20 mm/hr.\\nWomen under 50 years old: less than 20 mm/hr.\\nWomen over 50 years old: less than 30 mm/hr.\\nDoctor\u2019s do not base their decisions solely on ESR results. You can have a normal result and still have a problem. \\nModerately elevated ESR occurs with inflammation, but also with anemia, infection, pregnancy, and old age. \\nA very high ESR usually has an obvious cause, such as a marked increase in globulins that can be due to a severe infection. The doctor will use other follow-up tests, such as cultures, depending on the patient\u2019s symptoms. Persons with multiple myeloma or Waldenstrom\u2019s macroglobulinemia (tumors that make large amounts of immunoglobulins) typically have very high ESRs even if they don't have inflammation. Polymyalgia rheumatica and temporal arteritis may also have very high ESRs. A rising ESR can mean an increase in inflammation or a poor response to a therapy; a decreasing ESR can mean a good response. \\nAlthough a low ESR is not usually important, it can be seen with polycythemia (a condition where a patient makes too many red blood cells), with extreme leukocytosis (patient has too many white blood cells), and with some protein abnormalities. Some changes in red cell shape (such as sickle cells in sickle cell anemia) also lower the ESR.\n\nAnswer:",

Some plants have an analogous system: the vascular system in vascular plants; trumpet hyphae in bryophytes.\\n\\nRoot hairs are thin-walled extensions of the epidermal cells in roots. They provide increased surface area and thus more efficient absorption of water and minerals. Water and dissolved mineral nutrients enter the plant via two routes. \\n\\n\\nWater and selected solutes pass through only the cell membrane of the epidermis of the root hair and then through plasmodesmata on every cell until they reach the xylem: intracellular route (apoplastic). Water and solutes enter the cell wall of the root hair and pass between the wall and plasma membrane until the encounter the endodermis, a layer of cells that they must pass through to enter the xylem: extracellular route (symplastic). \\n\\n\\nThe endodermis has a strip of water-proof material (containing suberin) known as the Casparian strip that forces water through the endodermal cell and in such a way regulates the amount of water getting to the xylem. Only when water concentrations inside the endodermal cell fall below that of the cortex parenchyma cells does water flow into the endodermis and on into the xylem.\\nXylem and Transport \\nXylem is the water transporting tissue in plants that is dead when it reaches functional maturity. Tracheids are long, tapered cells of xylem that have end plates on the cells that contain a great many crossbars. Tracheid walls are festooned with pits. Vessels, an improved form of tracheid, have no (or very few) obstructions (crossbars) on the top or bottom of the cell. The functional diameter of vessels is greater than that of tracheids.\\n\\nWater is pulled up the xylem by the force of transpiration, water loss from leaves. Mature corn plants can each transpire four gallons of water per week. Transpiration rates in arid-region plants can be even higher. Water molecules are hydrogen bonded to each other. Water lost from the leaves causes diffusion of additional water molecules out of the leaf vein xylem, creating a tug on water molecules along the water columns within the xylem. This \"tug\" causes water molecules to rise up from the roots to eventually the leaves. The loss of water from the root xylem allows additional water to pass throught the endodermis into the root xylem.\\n\\nCohesion is the ability of molecules of the same kind to stick together. Water molecules are polar, having slight positive and negative sides, which causes their cohesion. Inside the xylem, water molecules are in a long chain extending from the roots to the leaves. \\n\\nAdhesion is the tendency of molecules of different kinds to stick together. Water sticks to the cellulose molecules in the walls of the xylem, counteracting the force of gravity and aiding the rise of water within the xylem. \\n\\nCohesion-Adhesion Theory\\nTranspiration exerts a pull on the water column within the xylem. The lost water molecules are replaced by water from the xylem of the leaf veins, causing a tug on water in the xylem. Adhesion of water to the cell walls of the xylem facilitates movement of water upward within the xylem. This combination of cohesive and adhesive forces is referred to as the Cohesion-Adhesion Theory.\\n\\n\\nGuard Cells Regulate Transpiration\\nIn most environments, the water concentration outside the leaf is less than that inside the leaf, causing a loss of water through openings in the leaf known as stomata (singular = stoma). Guard cells are crescent-shaped cells of the epidermis that flank the stoma and regulate the size of the opening. Together, the guard cells and stoma comprise the stomatal apparatus. The inner wall of the guard cell is thicker than the rest of the wall. When a guard cell takes up potassium ions, water moves into the cell, causing the cell to become turgid and swell, opening the stoma. When the potassium leaves the guard cell, the water \n\nAnswer:",

I moved here about 5 years ago and i love it. Here is all u need to know.. And it's so true!\\n\\nLIFE IN GEORGIA  \\nThis is for anyone who lives in Atlanta, Georgia, has ever lived  in Atlanta, has ever visited  Atlanta, ever plans to visit Atlanta, knows anyone who already lives in Atlanta, or knows anyone who  has ever heard of  Atlanta. Atlanta is composed mostly of one-way streets. The only way to get out  of downtown Atlanta is to turn around  and start over when you reach Greenville, South  Carolina. \\n \\nAll directions start with, \"Go down Peachtree\" and  include the phrase, \"When you see the Waffle House.\" Except, that in Cobb  County, where all directions begin with, \"Go to the Big  Chicken.\" \\n \\nPeachtree Street has no beginning and no end  and  is not to be confused  with: \\n\\nPeachtree  Circle          Peachtree  Battle \\nPeachtree  Place          Peachtree  Corners \\nPeachtree  Lane           New  Peachtree \\nPeachtree  Road          Old  Peachtree \\nPeachtree Parkway     West  Peachtree \\nPeachtree  Run            Peachtree-Dunwoody \\nPeachtree Terrace       Peachtree-Chamblee \\nPeachtree Avenue       Peachtree Industrial  Boulevard \\nPeachtree  Commons \\n \\nAtlantans only know their way to work and their way home. If you ask anyone for directions, they will always send you down Peachtree. \\n \\nAtlanta is the home of Coca-Cola. Coke's all they drink  there, so don't ask for any other soft drink unless it's made by  Coca-Cola. \\n \\nThe gates at Atlanta's Hartsfield International Airport are about 32 miles away from the Main Concourse, so wear sneakers and pack a lunch. \\n \\nThe 8a.m. rush hour is from 6:30 to 10:30 AM. The 5pm rush hour is from 3:00 to 7:30 PM. Friday's rush hour starts Thursday afternoon and lasts through 2am  Saturday. \\n \\nOnly a native can pronounce Ponce De Leon Avenue, so do not attempt the Spanish pronunciation. People will simply tilt their heads to the right and stare at you. The Atlanta pronunciation is \"pawntz duh LEE-awn.\" \\n \\nAnd yes, they have a street named simply, \"Boulevard.\" \\n \\nThe falling of one raindrop causes all drivers to immediately forget all traffic rules. If a single snowflake falls, the city is paralyzed for three days and it's on all the channels as a  news flash every 15 minutes for a week. Overnight, all grocery stores will be sold out of milk, bread, bottled water, toilet paper, and \\nbeer. \\n \\nIf you're told to go to Bankhead Highway and can't find  it, It's because the name is Veterans Memorial but the locals still call it Bankhead. \\n \\nAlso, once the road you're on crosses another road, the name of the road you're on changes. Some roads names change every half mile or so. \\n \\nI-285, the loop that encircles Atlanta, which has a  posted speed limit of 55 mph (but you have to maintain 80 mph just to keep from getting run over),  is known to truckers as \"The Watermelon  500.\" \\n \\nDon't believe the directional markers on  highways. I-285 is marked \\n \\n\"East\" and \"West\" but you may be going  North or South. The locals identify the direction by referring to the \"Inner Loop\" and the \"Outer Loop.\" If you travel on Hwy 92 North, you will actually be going southeast. \\n \\nNever buy a ladder or mattress in Atlanta. Just go to one of the interstates and you will soon find one in the middle of the road. \\n \\nThe last thing you want to do is give another driver the finger, unless your car is armored, your trigger finger is itchy and your AK-47 has a full clip. \\n \\nPossums sleep in the middle of the road with their feet in the air. \\n \\nThere are 5,000 types of snakes and 4,998 live in Georgia. \\n \\nThere are 10,000 types of spiders.

The label World War I or First World War did not come into general use until after the outbreak of World War II in 1939, and until then it was commonly known as the Great War or the World War. The war was fought by the Allied Powers on one side, and the Central Powers on the other, resulting in eventual victory for the Allies. No previous conflict had mobilized so many soldiers or involved so many in the field of battle. By its end, the war had become the bloodiest war in recorded history, though this record was soon to be superseded by World War II.\\n\\nAmongst Western countries, World War I became infamous for trench warfare along the Western Front, involving a system of opposing trenches (separated by a \"No Man's Land\") running from the North Sea to the border of Switzerland. More than 9 million soldiers died on the various battlefields, and nearly that many more in the participating countries' home fronts on account of food shortages and genocide committed under the cover of various civil wars and internal conflicts. In World War I, only some 5% of the casualties (directly caused by the war) were civilian - in World War II, this figure approached 50%.\\n\\nUltimately, World War I created a decisive break with the old world order that had emerged after the Napoleonic Wars, as modified by the mid-19th century national revolutions, the processes of European national unification and European colonialism. Three European land empires were shattered and subsequently dismembered to varying degrees: the German, the Austro-Hungarian and the Russian. In the Balkans and the Middle East, the Ottoman Empire experienced the same fate. Three European imperial dynasties, represented by the Hohenzollern, the Hapsburg and the Romanov families in Germany, Austria-Hungary and Russia respectively, also fell during the war.\\n\\nWorld War I witnessed the first advent of Communism as a means of government in Russia. The following decades would see the transformation of the old Russian Empire into the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, a global superpower. In the east, the demise of the Ottoman Empire paved the way for a modern democratic successor state, Turkey, in the core region of Anatolia, in addition to a number of successor states and territories throughout the Middle East. In Central Europe, the new states of Czechoslovakia, Finland, Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia and Yugoslavia were born and Austria, Hungary and Poland were re-created. Shortly after the war, in 1923, Fascists came to power in Italy; in 1933, 15 years after the war, Nazism took over Germany. Problems unresolved or created by the war would be highly important factors in the outbreak, within 20 years, of World War II.\\n\\n\\n\\nCauses:\\n\\nOn June 28, 1914, Franz Ferdinand, Archduke of Austria and heir to the Austro-Hungarian throne, was assassinated in Sarajevo by Gavrilo Princip, a Bosnian Serb student. The Archduke was there to assert imperial authority over a disputed province. Princip was supported by pan-Serbian nationalists, with links to the Serbian military. Though this assassination is usually considered the immediate trigger for the war, its origins can be traced back to the complex web of alliances and counterbalances that developed between the various European powers after 1871.\\n\\n\\nReasons and responsibilities\\nThe reasons for the outbreak of World War I are a complicated issue; there are many factors which intertwine. Some examples are:\\n\\nFervent and uncompromising nationalism \\nUnresolved previous disputes \\nThe intricate system of alliances \\nConvoluted and fragmented governance \\nDelays and misunderstandings in diplomatic communications \\nThe arms races of the previous decades. \\nRigidity in military planning \n\nAnswer:",

How are they similar?\nQuestion: I need some Biology help! Can some one explain how allopatric speciation differs from sympatric speciation, and give examples of each? And how are the concepts of gradualism and punctuated equilibrium different, and how are they similar?\\n\\nThanks for the help! Biology has proven to be a little out of my realm of comprehension.\nAnswer: The difference betwen allopatric and sympatric is easy to remember: allopatric is geographical, sympatric is non-geographical.  \\n\\nAllopatric speciation involves a geographical separation (like a river, a mountain, a drought, separation following a migration, etc.)  Two subpopulations of a species get isolated from each other and evolve separately.  If this isolation is long enough, the two subspecies will first lose the desire, and then the ability to interbreed ... hence speciation.   This is believed to be the most common form of speciation in animals.\\n\\nSympatric speciation involves no geographical barrier, the two subspecies share territory.  One way that could happen is if there are two niches (like two types of food) in the same territory .... if some members prefer (or are slightly better adapted) for one food and others prefer the other food, then each will tend to meet and mate more with others of the same preference.  Thus any difference in adaptation between the two subspecies will get amplified, and the two may show less desire, and eventually an inability, to interbreed.  This is considered very rare in the animal kingdom except for insects, but may be more common in plants.  An example commonly given is the apple maggot (a kind of fly).\\n\\n(See source 1 for a better description.)\\n\\nPunctuated equilibrium is a theory developed by Niles Elderedge and my favorite science writer, Stephen Jay Gould.  It is the view that species often go through long periods of relative stability (equilibrium) that is broken up (punctuated) by periods of relatively fast change.  (See source 2 for a great illustration of how it works.)\\n\\nContrast this with gradualism, which holds that evolutionary change happens at a steady pace. \\n\\nThey are similar in that they both hold that evolution is a slow process ... in fact, it is a common misconception that they are opposites, when in fact punctuated equilibrium is a form of gradualism because it still holds that evolution is a long gradual process.  (See source 3)\\n\\nIn other words the opposite of gradualism is not punctuated equilibrium, it is something called 'catastrophism', where change occurs as a result of short-lived violent events (catastrophes).  Few scientists today are catastrophists. \\n\\nFeel free to email me if any of this is unclear.\n\nAnswer:",

So the four corners are (-5, 10)....etc. After I rotate it say 30 degrees. What are the four new corner values? What is the general formula to calculate if there is one.\nAnswer: The general rotation transform function is to multiply its coordinate in complex coordination by the transform function of R(teta)=cos(teta)+i*sin(teta) where teta is the transform (rotation) angle and i is the imaginary unique value.\\nSuppose coordination of your point is (x,y); so the transformed point (x',y') would be:\\nx'+i*y'=(x+i*y)*\\n        [cos(teta)+i*sin(teta)]\\n       =[x*cos(teta)-y*sin(teta)]+\\n        i*[x*sin(teta)+y*cos(teta)]\\ntherefore:\\nx'=x*cos(teta)-y*sin(teta)\\ny'=x*sin(teta)+y*cos(teta)\\n\\nin your example, the point (-5,10) after rotation of 30 degrees counterclockwise will be transformed to:\\nx'=-5*cos(30)-10*sin(30)~ -9.33\\ny'=-5*sin(30)+10*cos(30)~ +6.16\n\nAnswer:",

The formal definition can be found here at wikipedia:\\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_rate_of_return\\n\\nIt is simply a method used to compare different investment scenarios. As different alternatives may involve different sums of money paid at different points in time, it may be difficult to objectively compare them. The IRR simply produces a single number for each alternative, and the one with the highest IRR is chosen as the best one.\\n\\nWhat it basically measures is the amount of interest that a bank account would have to pay in order to attain the same cash payments.\\n\\nSome simple examples:\\n\\nFor instance, if you were to pay $100, and then receive $110 back 1 year later, the IRR is 10%.\\n\\nIf you were to pay $100, then receive $10 back one year later, and then $110 one year after that (two years after the beginning), then the IRR is still 10%.\\n\\nIn general, the IRR is difficult to solve, and must use iterative numerical methods for its solution.\\n\\nThere are also known problems with IRR that make its usefulness somewhat limited.\\n\\nLet's just say that you had a situation where you received $110 dollars now, and only had to pay $100 one year from now. If you work through the numbers, you would find the IRR to be -10% (note the MINUS).\\n\\nIf instead you received $100 now and had to pay back $100 one year from now, the IRR would be 0%.\\n\\nNow we can see the problem - clearly the first alternative is favourable, you receive more money UP FRONT than you even need to pay in. Unfortunately, IRR messes up in these kinds of cases and gives you a misleading result.\n\nAnswer:",

Example: the 5 year average P/E range for most banks has been 12-28. However, stocks in the retail sales industry (Pet Smart, Best Buy, etc.) have had an average 24-44 P/E multiple over this same period even though their margins are lower.\nAnswer: Hi Dave,\\n\\nI saved an article a while back that addressed this same question. Basically it has to do with the required reserves that banks must have because they take your deposits (and due to the nature of the business).  The article is below but is missing the related tables that it references.  Email me at bimmayute1@yahoo.com and I'll send you the article (word doc).\\n\\nNicholas\\nnsmconsulting.net\\n\\n\\n\\nBy Vitaliy Katsenelson, CFA\\n02/10/2006 \\nInvesting in the stock market is a never-ending learning experience. That's what makes it so appealing and intellectually stimulating. And I inadvertently had one of those live-and-learn experiences just the other day. \\nIn my piece on Lloyds TSB(NYSE: LYG), I wrote that banks usually trade at lower price-to-earnings ratios to the market because they are considered riskier investments as a result of their high use of debt. That line caught the eye of Foolish financial editor Joey Khattab, who asked writers Stephen Simpson and Nate Parmelee whether they agreed with my logic. Both disagreed. They argued that larger banks have lower P/Es generally because they are perceived to have a slower or more limited growth potential. \\nAt first, I thought there might be a conspiracy of Fools at work against me! So I asked several investment professionals for their opinion. And to my amazement, they all agreed with the Fools. \\nSo I looked at some larger banks to see whether they had been slow growers in the past, and I couldn't reach that conclusion. Many of these banks, in fact, had achieved very respectable earnings growth and paid above-average dividends in the process. I then looked at expectations for future earnings growth, and they appeared not to be below average, either. With the exception of Fifth Third(Nasdaq: FITB), which Wall Street once loved to love and now loves to hate, the rest of the pack was trading at a substantial discount to the market and still are. \\nInstitution 10-Year Avg. EPS Growth Rate Median 10-Year P/E Current Dividend Proj. EPS Growth \\nCitigroup18.6% 15.3 3.8% 10% \\nU.S.Bancorp(NYSE: USB)\\n17.5% 14.3 4.5% 10% \\nFifth Third15.8% 22.7 4.1% 10% \\nWells Fargo(NYSE: WFC)\\n12.8% 15.6 3.4% 11% \\nBank of America(NYSE: BAC)\\n9.3% 13.4 4.5% 9% \\nAmsouth8.7% 12.8 3.7% 8% \\nRegions Financial(NYSE: RF)\\n4.6% 13.7 4.0% 8% \\nWachovia(1.6%) 13.6 3.9% 10% \\nJPMorgan Chase(NYSE: JPM)\\n(2.7%) 15.0 3.6% 10% \\n\\nThe answer must be more complex than just the growth rates. I believe the answer to banks' lower P/Es lies in the following four factors. \\n1. Cyclicality \\nThe banking business is closely tied to the health of the economy. As the economy expands, demand for loans increases and bad debt declines -- a combination that improves banks' profitability. In a contracting economy, of course, the reverse takes place. \\nBecause investors pay up for predictability, they rarely pay a full market multiple for the volatility that comes with cyclical companies. Cyclical heavy-industrial companies like Caterpillar and Ingersoll Rand, for example, usually trade below the market P/E just as a many banks do. \\n2. Financial leverage \\nWe have not had a bank crisis in the U.S. for a while, so most investors have forgotten just how risky banks can be. But as Warren Buffett has said, by the time you find out a bank has a problem, it will be too late. The equity at most banks stands at meager 6%-10% of total assets, so when a bank does make a mistake, its high leverage amplifies the problem. \\n3. Interest rate volatility \\nBanks are subject to the risks that come with changing interest rates. They prosper when the difference between long-term and short-term rates -- in other words, the interest rate spread -- is high. However, when that spread narrows, it becomes increasingly difficult for banks to make any money. Many banks have addressed the problem by boosting their fee businesses. For example, fees account for a full 46% of U.S. Bancorp's income, thereby making the com\n\nAnswer:",

Do this with a lot of dribbles and then with as few as possible. Stay low! \\n\\n\\nDrum dribble \\nEither standing or on one knee have players dribble ball changing hands with each touch. Start with a steady dribble then work down to super fast low dribbles. then have them dribble with one finger on each hand and with their balled up fist. \\n\\nKeep your head up\\nWhen you dribble the ball, your intent is to go somewhere. Maybe you are dribbling up the court on a fast break, maybe you are dribbling to the wing as part of the offense, or maybe you are driving past the defender and to the basket. Whatever your goal and wherever you are going, you need to see the floor. Never dribble the ball with your head down, looking at the ball. By keeping your head up and seeing the floor, you can see where the defense is and what your next move might have to be. You can also see where your teammates are, who might be open, and what a good passing opportunity might be.\\n\\nThis is a great drill for getting used to dribbling with your head up so you can see the floor: simply start at one baseline and dribble full speed the full length of the court, keeping your head up at all times. DO NOT look down at the ball. Switch hands at half court. You can also try this drill with your eyes closed. But only dribble at half speed, and make sure to open your eyes after a few dribbles to make sure you aren't going to run into anything.\\n\\n\\nBe able to dribble with either hand\\nIf you can only dribble effectively with your strong hand, you are very limited as an offensive threat. If I'm a defender, and I know you can only dribble to your right side, it will be very easy to guard you. But if you can drive to either your right or left, and have a good outside shot, then you're a real threat. Then I have to guard against a shot, and a drive to either side. Now you've got me guessing about what you might do next. Work on dribbling with both hands so that you don't have a weak dribbling hand. Work at it enough that you can dribble and drive to the baset equally well with either hand.\\n\\nThere are two ways to build your off-hand dribbling skills: one is simply to practice with your off hand. Make a point to do ONLY off hand dribbling drills for 15 or 20 mins a day for the next week. You'll be amazed at how much better your off hand will be in just that short amount of time.\\n\\nAnother amazing set of drills for developing your off hand are two-ball drills. Get two basketballs and start off at the baseline. Dribble both balls in a zig-zag pattern for the full length of the court, bouncing the balls at the same time. Once you reach the other end of the floor, do the same drill, but this time bounce the balls at different times (one ball hits the ground as the other ball comes up to your other hand, etc.). Remember, don't look down at the balls as you dribble. Do these drills for a few weeks and your off hand dribbling ability will be much improved.\\n\\n\\nBALL SLAP DRILL \\nThe ball slap drill is performed by taking the ball and with your left hand slap the ball hard, and then taking your right hand and slap the ball hard. This ball slap drill is a good way to warm your hands up and this will help you get a good feel for the ball. Continue performing the slap the ball dribbling drill until your hands are good, awake, and ready to begin. \\n\\n\\nAROUND THE WORLD DRILL \\nBasketball Dribbling Drill #2: The around the world basketball drill stats by circling the ball around your head, than your waist, and finally put your legs together and take the ball around both legs at the knees. Then, bend at the waist, spread your legs, and circle the ball around one leg, then the other.

Though quite old, he still was able to defeat any challenger. His reputation extended far and wide throughout the land and many students gathered to study under him.\\nOne day an infamous young warrior arrived at the village. He was determined to be the first man to defeat the great master. Along with his strength, he had an uncanny ability to spot and exploit any weakness in an opponent. He would wait for his opponent to make the first move, thus revealing a weakness, and then would strike with merciless force and lightning speed. No one had ever lasted with him in a match beyond the first move.\\n\\nMuch against the advice of his concerned students, the old master gladly accepted the young warrior's challenge. As the two squared off for battle, the young warrior began to hurl insults at the old master. He threw dirt and spit in his face. For hours he verbally assaulted him with every curse and insult known to mankind. But the old warrior merely stood there motionless and calm. Finally, the young warrior exhausted himself. Knowing he was defeated, he left feeling shamed.\\n\\nSomewhat disappointed that he did not fight the insolent youth, the students gathered around the old master and questioned him. \"How could you endure such an indignity?

In mice, black fur colour is dominant to brown. Answer TRUE/FALSE to the following statements:\\n\\n(a) Matings of pure breeding black mice with brown mice would yield both black and brown offspring in the ratio 3:1\\n\\n(b) Matings of pure breeding black mice would yield only black offspring\\n\\n(c) Matings of brown mice could yield black and brown offspring\\n\\n(d) Matings of heterozygous black mice with brown mice would yield both black and brown offspring in the ratio of 1:1\\n\\nand also if possible could you explain how you got your answers! thank you so much, i've racked my brain over and over again with this question and i just can't seem to get it. So explanations are much appreciated as they will help me to understand it a little better. Thank you so much!!\nAnswer: Let B mean the genotype for dominant black fur and b mean the genotype for brown fur. \\n\\nRecall that when a gene is dominant, it is always expressed when  it is present. When a gene is recessive then it is ONLY expressed  when there is no alternative.\\n\\na) Pure black mice would have B1B2 and brown mice must be b1b2 because it is a recessive gene. (I've put in the numbers to act as subscripts so it makes more sense.) Crossing these, you would get offspring that inherit one gene from each parent.\\nB1b1 ==> black\\nB1b2 ==> black\\nB2b1 ==> black\\nB2b2 ==> black\\n\\nSo false because all the offspring from pure black and brown rats would be black. \\n\\nb) True. Pure black mice have BB. As both parents have BB then there's not a chance for bb to occur!\\n\\nc) False. Brown mice are always bb (recessive) so bb x bb can never result in Bb or BB. So offspring of 2 brown mice are always brown.\\n\\nd) Heterozygous black mice are Bb. So crossed with brown mouse bb (b1b2):\\nBb1 ==> black\\nbb1 ==> brown\\nBb2 ==> black\\nbb2 ==> brown\\nSo you get equal numbers of black and brown offspring. True.\n\nAnswer:",

The circumstances of the terrorist attacks deserve the most serious and conscientious investigation. Both the Bush administration and the Democrats and Republicans in Congress have rejected any such probe, suggesting that to question the role of the FBI, CIA and other intelligence agencies is unpatriotic.\\n\\nBut the facts which are known so far point to the conclusion that officials at the highest levels of the US government knew that a major terrorist attack was under way and made no serious effort to prevent it. The political motive can be inferred: they permitted an attack to go forward\u2014whether they knew its full dimensions or not\u2014in order to provide the necessary pretext for carrying out a right-wing agenda of military intervention abroad and attacks on democratic rights at home.\n\nAnswer:",

This is especially noticeable on the Japanese strike aircraft flying over Oahu toward Pearl Harbor Naval Station itself.\\n\\n\\nAnachronisms: When Col. Bratton and Lt. Cmdr. Kramer walk into the Navy cryptography workroom, the Marine sentry at the door is wearing \"modified blues\" - a khaki shirt and tie with the USMC dress-blue uniform's red-striped blue trousers. The Marine Corps didn't adopt this uniform until after World War II.\\n\\n\\nAnachronisms: When the captain runs into the building to send the message \"This is not a drill,\" a Pearl Harbor memorial can be seen in the background as he rushes past.\\n\\n\\nAnachronisms: In the opening scene of Washington D.C., the building on the left is the Museum of American History which was not built until around 1959.\\n\\n\\nAnachronisms: Early in the attack, one deck officer is shown wearing a \"Caravelle\" wristwatch with the imprint \"Waterproof\" on the dial face. Bulova's web site indicates that the Caravelle line of watches was introduced in 1962, some 21 years after the attack.\\n\\n\\nContinuity: When the Ward attacks the Japanese minisub near the entrance to Pearl harbor, the minisub's depth is inconsistent between shots. We see it alternately with its entire sail out of the water, then with just the periscope visible.\\n\\n\\nCrew or equipment visible: When the Japanese planes are launching from their carrier on the morning of the attack, as the 3rd or 4th plane launches against the morning twilight, the head and camera of a cameraman can be seen silhouetted at the bottom of the screen.\\n\\n\\nAudio/visual unsynchronized: When Ambassador Nomura is speaking with Secretary Hull, Shogo Shimada's voice is dubbed by Paul Frees. However, when Hull invites Nomura to sit down, you can hear Shimada speak with his own voice and then the dubbing resumes.\\n\\n\\nContinuity: When the first B-17 is being chased by the Japanese fighter, only one wheel is down. In the next shot both wheels are down and in the shot where the plane finally lands only one wheel is down.\\n\\n\\nFactual errors: When the Japanese aircraft are taking off from the carriers to bomb Pearl Harbor, several of the aircraft that would have carried a crew of two or three (representing Nakajima B5N torpedo bombers and Aichi D3A dive bombers) are seen with a pilot and without the other crewmembers (gunner, radio operator, etc)\\n\\n\\nFactual errors: The full-scale replica of USS Nevada seen throughout movie has too many 14-inch guns. USS Nevada and USS Oklahoma had 10 14-inch guns (2 3-gun turrets and 2 2-gun turrets, with one of each type turret fore and aft). The full-scale Nevada has 12 14-inch guns as found on later USS Arizona and USS Pennsylvania. The miniature models of Nevada and Oklahoma used in the Battleship Row sequences have the correct number and layout of 14-inch guns.\\n\\n\\nContinuity: When USS Ward commences attack on Japanese midget sub, sub is shown with piece of conning tower missing before Ward hits it with gunfire. As sub is diving after being hit, conning tower is intact.\\n\\n\\nAnachronisms: Incoming Japanese planes fly over a modern microwave tower on a ridge on Oahu.\\n\\n\\nAudio/visual unsynchronized: When the band is playing the \"Star Spangled Banner\" as the attack begins, the audio and video are out of sync at the end. Also, the band appears to have played the song twice.\\n\\n\\nRevealing mistakes: As Cordell Hull is getting word of the attack over the phone in his office, he's holding the receiver against his cheek, not \n\nAnswer:",

When I asked for a copy of the appraisal, our realtor indicated that the appraiser normally stopped just above the requested loan amount, even if the home would appraise higher.  Why is this?  If we want an actual appraisal, do we have to purchase that separately?  We're paying for the appraisal ourselves & would really like to know the true appraised value of the home we're buying.\nAnswer: Because normally the appraiser feels it is his job only to justify the price that the house is selling for.  Remember the appraiser is ultimately there to protect the bank that is loaning you the money for the home.  If you default they want to know that they will be able to recoup their costs.\\n\\nIf the appraiser said that the house was worth 50,000 more than you are paying for it are you going to now pay the seller 50,000 more?  If the appraiser says it is worth less than you are paying for it, then the bank is going to make you pay cash for the difference, the bank won't give you a mortgage for more than the appraisal.\\n\\nThere is no incentive for the appraiser to come in with a high appraisal.  They only need to appraise it for the amount that the current transaction is.\\n\\nThe buyer and seller have agreed on a price, the appraisal is there to give peace of mind that the house is worth at least that much.\n\nAnswer:",

In Italy and in Malta, it is sometimes referred to as St. Anthony's fire. It occurs very rarely in children and adults, but its incidence is high in the elderly (over 60), as well as in any age group of immunocompromised patients. It affects some 500,000 people per year in the United States. Treatment is generally with antiviral drugs such as aciclovir. Many patients develop a painful condition called postherpetic neuralgia which is often difficult to manage.\\n\\nIn some patients, herpes zoster can reactivate subclinically with pain in a dermatomal distribution without rash. This condition is known as zoster sine herpete and may be more complicated, affecting multiple levels of the nervous system and causing multiple cranial neuropathies, polyneuritis, myelitis, or aseptic meningitis.\\n\\nThe word herpes comes from the Greek word for snake; it is cognate with herpetology[1].\n\nAnswer:",

Chemicals in food stimulate sensory neurons in the taste buds, which communicate with the brain via one of three cranial nerves: the facial nerve (VII), the glossopharyngeal nerve (IX), or the vagus nerve (X).  These nerves enter the central nervous system at the level of the brainstem, synapsing with secondary neurons in the solitary nucleus.  The signals then pass upwards through the thalamus to the gustatory cortex, which is part of the primary somatosensory cortex located on the surface of the parietal lobes.  Note that the functioning of this pathway depends heavily on normal functioning of the sense of smell.  This is why your food tastes bland when you have a bad cold with a stuffy nose.\n\nAnswer:",

In the United States, tender offers are regulated by the Williams Act.\\n\\nTo induce the shareholders of the target company to sell, the acquiror's offer price usually includes a premium over the current market price of the target company's shares. For example, if a target corporation's stock were trading at a value of $1/share, an acquiror might offer $1.15/share to its shareholders on the condition that 51% of shareholders agree. Cash or other securities may be offered to the target company's shareholders as consideration, although a tender offer in which securities are offered as consideration is generally referred to as an \"exchange offer.\"-\n\nAnswer:",

A Scholastic Professional Book.\\n\\nWay back in 1676, Robert Plot, the curator of an English museum, described and drew a thigh bone that he believed belonged to a giant man. Although that fossil disappeared without a trace, the surviving illustration suggests that it may well have been part of a \"Megalosaurus.\" Later, in 1822, large teeth discovered in England by Mary Ann Mantell and her husband, Gideon, were thought to be the remains of a huge and extinct iguana. It wasn't until 1841 that British scientist Richard Owen came to realize that such fossils were distinct from the teeth or bones of any living creature. The ancient animals were so different, in fact, that they deserved their own name. So Owen dubbed the group \"Dinosauria,\" which means \"terrible lizards.\"\\n\\nAcross the ocean in North America, dinosaur tracks were studied in the Connecticut Valley, beginning in the 1830's. They were believed to belong to enormous ravens, freed from Noah's Ark after the Great Flood. At that time, paleontology was long on deduction and short on evidence. This was remedied when two wealthy and competitive American scientists, Othniel Marsh and Edward Cope, raced to excavate fossils in the Rocky Mountain region. In the late 1800's, their separate teams, armed against Native Americans and each other, dug up tons of bones from several sites. All in all, Marsh and Cope's rivalry \u2014 known as the Bone Wars \u2014 uncovered 136 new species. And their respective fossil displays generated excitement for dinosaurs the world over.\\n\\nIn the 1900's, enthusiasm for dinosaurs grew steadily, attracting the attention of the scientific community. Institutions such as the Carnegie Museum of Natural History and the American Museum of Natural History assembled dig teams, which uncovered many rich bone beds in North America (as did their counterparts overseas). New sites in Utah revealed several different species, including \"Camarasaurus,\" \"Apatosaurus,\" and \"Stegosaurus;\" \"Tyrannosaurus rex\" remains were found in Montana and baby Coelosaurs in New Mexico.\\n\\nIn recent decades, dinosaur research continues, but the emphasis has shifted from finding and classifying these animals to analyzing and reconstructing their lives and habitats. In the late 1960's, Robert Bakker proposed that these ancient creatures may well have been as agile and energetic as warm-blooded animals. In the mid 1970's, Peter Dodson, along with James Farlow, hypothesized that they used their horns to attract the attention of females, as well as for fighting. And in the late 1970's, Jack Horner made history by identifying some of the first dinosaurs nests and eggs in North America. These important \"Maiasaura\" fossils helped to determine that some species nested in colonies and cared for their young.\\n\\nIn the past few years, several paleontologists, including Ken Carpenter, Phil Currie, and William Coombs, have identified juvenile dinosaurs that were previously thought to be adults; and David Weishampel has theorized that some dinosaurs probably used their crests and nasal passages to create sound. Each day, scientists working all over the world, in the field and in research labs, help to redefine the meaning of the world \"dinosaur.\"\n\nAnswer:",

Scoliosis can also begin in a fetus during fetal development. Congenital scoliosis is a type of birth defect that affects the development of the vertebrae and often occurs with other congenital problems.\\n\\nScoliosis runs in families and may involve genetic (hereditary) factors. But researchers haven't identified the gene or genes that may cause scoliosis.

A \"subsidiary\" is where it's parent company owns 50% or more (and has management control).  A subsidiary is consolidated into the parent company's financial statements.  \\n\\n2.  An \"associate\" is 20-50% owned, with the parent company not having management control. An associate is reported using equity accounting.\\n\\n3.  \"Cost\" accounting is typically used on investments where the parent owns less than 20%.  The investment is reported at the lower of cost or market.  \\n\\n4. If an investment is held for sale or as inventory, the investment is reported at market.\n\nAnswer:",

Other lifeforms, stuff like that.\nAnswer: Did God have a beginning?\\n\\nPs. 90:2: \u201cBefore the mountains themselves were born, or you proceeded to bring forth as with labor pains the earth and the productive land, even from time indefinite to time indefinite you are God.\u201d\\n\\nIs that reasonable? Our minds cannot fully comprehend it. But that is not a sound reason for rejecting it. Consider examples: (1) Time. No one can point to a certain moment as the beginning of time. And it is a fact that, even though our lives end, time does not. We do not reject the idea of time because there are aspects of it that we do not fully comprehend. Rather, we regulate our lives by it. (2) Space. Astronomers find no beginning or end to space. The farther they probe into the universe, the more there is. They do not reject what the evidence shows; many refer to space as being infinite. The same principle applies to the existence of God.\\n\\nOther examples: (1) Astronomers tell us that the heat of the sun at its core is 27,000,000 degrees Fahrenheit (15,000,000\u00b0 C.). Do we reject that idea because we cannot fully comprehend such intense heat? (2) They tell us that the size of our Milky Way is so great that a beam of light traveling at over 186,000 miles per second (300,000 km/sec) would require 100,000 years to cross it. Do our minds really comprehend such a distance? Yet we accept it because scientific evidence supports it.\\n\\nWhich is more reasonable\u2014that the universe is the product of a living, intelligent Creator? or that it must have arisen simply by chance from a nonliving source without intelligent direction? Some persons adopt the latter viewpoint because to believe otherwise would mean that they would have to acknowledge the existence of a Creator whose qualities they cannot fully comprehend. But it is well known that scientists do not fully comprehend the functioning of the genes that are within living cells and that determine how these cells will grow. Nor do they fully understand the functioning of the human brain. Yet, who would deny that these exist? Should we really expect to understand everything about a Person who is so great that he could bring into existence the universe, with all its intricate design and stupendous size?\\n\\nInfinite, but approachable. The true God is infinite and beyond the mind of man fully to fathom. The creature could never hope to become equal to his Creator or understand all the workings of His mind. (Ro 11:33-36) But He can be found and approached, and He supplies his worshiper with all that is necessary for the worshiper\u2019s welfare and happiness. (Ac 17:26, 27; Ps 145:16) He is ever at the zenith of his ability and willingness to give good gifts and presents to his creatures, as it is written: \u201cEvery good gift and every perfect present is from above, for it comes down from the Father of the celestial lights, and with him there is not a variation of the turning of the shadow.\u201d (Jas 1:17) Jehovah always acts within his own righteous arrangements, doing all things on a legal basis. (Ro 3:4, 23-26) For this reason all of his creatures can have complete confidence in him, knowing that he always abides by the principles he establishes. He does not change (Mal 3:6), and there is no \u201cvariation\u201d with him in the application of his principles. There is no partiality with him (De 10:17, 18; Ro 2:11), and it is impossible for him to lie.\u2014Nu 23:16, 19; Tit 1:1, 2; Heb 6:17, 18.\n\nAnswer:",

Choking can become a medical emergency, as choking prevents breathing and will thus starve the brain and other organs of oxygen.\\n\\nIf the casualty can still cough effectively they will probably be able to cough up the offending object. The first aid at this point is to stand by and encourage coughing.\\nA cough is a sudden, often repetitive, spasmodic contraction of the thoracic cavity, resulting in violent release of air from the lungs, and usually accompanied by a distinctive sound. Cough is an action your body takes to get rid of substances that are irritating the air passages. A cough is usually initiated to clear a buildup of phlegm in the trachea; air may move through this passage at up to 480 km/h (300 mi/h) during a contraction. Coughing can also be triggered by a bolus of food going down the trachea instead of the esophagus, due to a failure of the epiglottis, although this may result in choking instead. Frequent or chronic coughing usually indicates the presence of a disease. Provided the patient is a non-smoker and has a normal chest xray, the cause of chronic cough in 93% of all patients is due to asthma, reflux (heartburn) or post-nasal drip. Other causes of chronic cough include chronic bronchitis and medications such as ACE inhibitors. Coughing can happen voluntarily as well as involuntarily.\n\nAnswer:",

WHY???\nAnswer: Rust is the substance formed when iron compounds corrode in the presence of oxygen and water. It is a mixture of iron oxides and hydroxides. Rusting is a common term for corrosion, and usually corrosion of steel.\\n\\nIron is found naturally in the ore haematite as iron oxide, and metallic iron tends to return to a similar state when exposed to air, (hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, etc.) and water. This corrosion is due to the oxidation reaction when iron metal returns to an energetically favourable state. Energy is given off when rust forms. The process of rusting can be summarized as three basic stages: The formation of iron(II) ions from the metal; the formation of hydroxide ions; and their reaction together, with the addition of oxygen, to create rust.\\n\\nIron is the main component of steel and the corrosion of steel is observed more frequently, since iron is rarely used without alloying in the present day.\\n\\nWhen steel contacts water, an electrochemical process starts. On the surface of the metal, iron is oxidized to iron(II):\\n\\n    Fe \u2192 Fe2+ + 2e\u2212\\n\\nThe electrons released travel to the edges of the water droplet, where there is plenty of dissolved oxygen. They reduce the oxygen and water to hydroxide ions:\\n\\n    4e\u2212 + O2 + 2H2O \u2192 4OH\u2212\\n\\nThe hydroxide ions react with the iron(II) ions and more dissolved oxygen to form iron oxide. The hydration is variable, however in its most general form:\\n\\n    Fe2+ + 2OH\u2212 \u2192 Fe(OH)2\\n    4Fe(OH)2 + O2 \u2192 2(Fe2O3.xH2O) + 2H2O\\n\\nHence, rust is hydrated iron(III) oxide. Corrosion tends to progress faster in seawater than fresh water due to higher concentration of sodium chloride ions, making the solution more conductive. Rusting is also accelerated in the presence of acids, but inhibited by alkalis. Rust can often be removed through electrolysis, however the base metal object can not be restored through this method.\n\nAnswer:",

This reputation came to public awareness in the 1950s and became a household name in the 1970s, mostly due to \"The Bermuda Triangle\", a bestselling book written by Charles Berlitz.\\n\\nVarious explanations for the apparent high number of dissapperances have been put forward, ranging from the mundane to the hyper-fantastic.\\n\\nSkeptics contend that this region has a comparable rate of maritime and aerial incidents as any other similar sized region of the ocean. They point out that Lloyd's of London, a world-reknowned insurer of maritime vessels, does not charge a higher insurance premium for ships that regularly traverse the triangle.\\n\\nScientific considerations for an increased dissaperance rate take into acount that this region experiences severe tropical storms and is the source of many hurricanes. These storms create an increased danger to both ship and air traffic.\\n\\nRougue waves have also been put forward as a possible cause. These rare waves can reach heights of as much as 100 feet (30 meters), easily swamping most ships. Rouge waves, however, would have no effect on air travel.\\n\\nA third scientific explanation is methane hydrates. Methane deposits on the ocean floor may release bursts of methane gas that reduces the density of the water it permeates. Since ships rely on displacement to stay afloat, a reduction of density in the water would cause a ship to immediately sink. As the methane leaves the water and rises into the air, it would reduce the density of the air as well, thus reducing lift on aircraft, causing them to descend rapidly. In addition, the methane would change the air mixture taken into the engines of the aircraft, causing the engine to stall. While these events have not been witnessed in nature, they have been proven in lab experiments.\\n\\nMore exotic explanations for the Bermuda Triangle include it being an area of magnetic disturbance, temporal (or time) holes, the location of the lost city of Atlantis, or extra-terrestrial abduction.\n\nAnswer:",

Is that \"fetus, zygote, embryo\" inside her REALLY part of her body? I don't think so. It is a human being with the same rights as you and me, and posseses an immortal soul. It has different DNA than the mother. That is NOT part of her body. \\n\\nIf we started killing animal babies in their mother's womb, I think people would care, and do something about it. They'd be appalled. But when a human, who is above an animal in every way is killed, we think nothing of it, and call it the woman's choice to decied whether her baby lives or dies.\\n\\n Is this twisted thinking on their part or what?\nAnswer: No one has the right to make a \"choice\" that kills another innocent human being.  It's amazing how completely ignorant most pro-aborts seem to be when it comes to prenatal development and pain perception:  \\n\\nhttp://www.advocatesfortheinnocent.com/fetalpain.html\\nhttp://www.justthefacts.org/clar.asp\\nhttp://www.abort73.com/HTML/I-A-2-prenatal.html\\nhttp://www.studentsforlife.uct.ac.za/foetal%20dev%20photos.html\\nhttp://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/in_pictures/3847319.stm\\nhttp://www.lifeissues.org/ultrasound/11weeks.htm\\nhttp://www.cbrinfo.org/Resources/pictures.html\\nhttp://www.abort73.com/HTML/I-A-4-video.html\\n\\nThe average age of an aborted baby in America is 10 weeks.  By that point, the child is fully formed and can even suck her thumb.  If her palm is pricked, she will pull her hand away and open her mouth.  In an ultrasound video of an abortion at 11 weeks, the child can be seen struggling violently to escape the suction instrument, while her heartrate doubles and she opens her mouth wide.  Unfeeling, unaware, and unformed?  Hardly!  However--even if the child was unaware and not fully developed, it would still be wrong to kill her.  Shooting a premature infant in her sleep is no less murderous than strangling a full-grown adult while he is awake.\\n\\nSince when does being \"unwanted\" make people less worthy to live than everyone else?  Should we kill homeless people and elderly people who are \"unwanted,\" too?  Let's be honest, too--there is no such thing as an \"unwanted\" baby in the U.S. There are two million couples waiting to adopt right now, including couples who want to adopt children with health problems such as HIV, Down Syndrome, and spina bifida.  \\n\\nNewborn babies cannot survive without their mothers, either.  Left alone, they will die.  They are completely dependent.  Does that mean it's okay to kill them, too?\\n\\nWhere is the compassion?  Where is the logic?  Pro-aborts are completely twisted, yes.\n\nAnswer:",

Any opinions?\nQuestion: I need to right about what myself and others think about animal rights and cruelty, and if it's right or wrong.\nAnswer: With animal rights and animal cruelty, it's often not a simple 'yes' or 'no' question, not a simple matter of 'right' or 'wrong'.  There are many degrees.\\n\\nIf you are talking about animal rights, what rights should an animal be afforded?  Does an animal have the same rights as a human?  Do all animals get the same levels of rights?  Does a single ant have the same right to life and liberty that a human, or even a dog does?  How about a starfish?  A sponge?  An amoeba?\\n\\nAt what level do you make the arbitrary decision that 'this organism has a right to exist, but this one doesn't?'\\n\\nDoes the Ebola virus have a right to exist and propagate itself?  If you don't agree a virus has the right to live, how about Cochliomyia hominivorax, the human screwworm?  Should you allow treatment of humans infested with intestinal parasites?\\n\\nWhere do you draw the line?\\n\\nThe same can be said for animal cruelty.  Who gets to decide what's cruel?  How exactly do you define cruelty?  Is dropping a kitten in boiling water cruel?  Most people would say yes.  How about dropping a mosquito larva in boiling water?  Or a lobster?  It's cruel to keep a kitten in a jar on your desk, but how about a goldfish?\\n\\nAs with most things in life, there is no easy answer.  Certainly, there should be some benefit, some gain to humanity that must be demonstrated in order to justify killing another organism, but what level of justification is required?  \\n\\nIs squirting caustic substances in a bunny's eyes justified if it means we can develop a substance that won't burn a child's eyes?  \\n\\nIs killing hundreds of thousands, even millions of mosquitoes justified if it keeps one person from dying from West Nile virus?  How about if it means you can have a backyard BBQ without being driven inside by biting flies?\\n\\nIs shooting a deer justified if it means that a family can eat for a month off the meat?  How about if some guy just really wants to kill something and put its head on his rec room wall?  How about if the deer are so overpopulated that they are becoming diseased and the overall health of the whole population is declining because they have eaten all the available forage?\\n\\nThere are no easy answers.\n\nAnswer:",

When the moon is near the horizon, the moonlight must pass through much more atmosphere than when the moon is directly overhead. By the time the moonlight reaches your eyes, the blue, green, and purple pieces of visible light have been scattered away by air molecules. That's why you only see yellow, orange, or red.\\n\\nThe moon can have an orange color at any time of the year. Sometimes the moon appears orange even when it's directly overhead. This occurs when there's a lot of dust, smoke, or pollution in the atmosphere. The size of those particles will determine the type of color you will see.\\n\\nHope that helps! ^^\n\nAnswer:",

Being considered independent, in turn, means that\\n\\n(a) you are no longer required to include your parents' income/asset information on your FAFSA\\n(b) you must include your spouse's income/asset information on your FAFSA\\n\\nThis can be a good or bad thing, depending on how much money your spouse makes.  Most undergraduate students would benefit from this status simply because their spouse would probably make less than their parents did.  However, it is worth noting that there are instances in which a student would become *less* needy by marrying (and therfore, potentially eligible for less financial aid)...\\n\\n(1) If you are a graduate student, you would already be considered independent and therefore would *already* not be including your parents' information on your FAFSA.  Were you to marry someone with any kind of income or assets, you would have to report those amounts, so it is likely that your EFC would increase with this newfound \"wealth.\"\\n\\n(2) Independent students are subject to a different EFC formula than dependent students.  The calculation is far too long to display here, but if you're curious as to what it takes into consideration, check here: http://www.ifap.ed.gov/efcinformation/attachments/0607EFCFormulaGuideDecFinal.pdf\\n\\nMost notable of everything in this link is that the income and asset \"conversion rates\" are higher for independent students than they are for dependent students.  What does this mean?  Say, for example, that your new spouse had exactly the same income/assets as your parents.  Even if everything else was the same (age, number in household, state of residence), your EFC as the married student would be higher because your spouse's income/assets would be \"converted\" (i.e. counted against you) at a higher rate than if they belonged to your parents.\\n \\nAs far as actual awards...\\n\\nIf is worth noting, that if you are an independent *undergraduate* student, you will be entitled to an additional $4,000 in Unsubsidized Stafford Loan funding (this number increases to $5,000 for your Junior and Senior years).  Note: Graduate students are eligible for much more Stafford loan funding than undergrads.\n\nAnswer:",

Proclomation of 1763 which prohibited the colonist from living west of the Appalachian Mts.-made the colonist mad and many disregarded the proclomation.\\n2. Britain raising taxes on the colonist to help defray the costs of the French and Indian War-the colonist protested and refused to pay the taxes.\\n3. Boston Massacre in 1770 which was used as American propoganda against the British when in fact it was a large crowd threatening a small group of British soldiers who either fired accidently or out of fear for their lives\\n4. Quartering of British soldiers in colonists homes-caused great resentment against the British.\\n5. Boston Tea Party in which colonist threw tea into Boston Harbor to protest the monopoly given the British East India Trading Company causing the British to pass the Coercive Acts which severly punished Boston.\\n6.  To show support for the Mass. colony all of the colonies except one met at the first Continental Congress and authorized colonies to raise militias, and to boycott British tea.\\n7. Lexington and Concord April 1775-British troops attempted to capture Sam Adams and a store of arms and powder at Concord, Mass.  The British were met at Lexington, Mass. on April 19th by a small group of \"minute men\", resulting in the death of several colonist.\\n8.

The patient will be asked to undress from the waist down (pants and panties), and be given a gown.  She will be asked to empty her bladder in the bathroom.  Usually, a preliminary x-ray image will be taken.  The only way to see the bladder and uterers (the tubes that connect the bladder to the kidney) with x-ray is to introduce a contrast or dye.  In order to do that, the patient must be catheterized.  The radiologic technologist or possibly a nurse will do this part of the study.  Your daughter will be laying on her back, with her knees bent and spread apart.  The tech/nurse will clean the outside of the genitilia with a betadine soap and insert a small tube through the urethra to the bladder.  This can be very uncomfortable as the tube is passed through the urethra, but once the tube is in place, your daughter will not know it is there.  It is important that she try to relax her muscles as the tube is introduced.  Tight muscles will make the insertion harder and it will take longer, meaning it will prolong the uncomfortable feeling.  Once the tube is in place, the legs are straightened and her gown or even a blanket will be put over her, so that she is not exposed.  At that point, the radiologist will enter the room.  While watching in real time on a TV screen, the radiologist will start allowing the contrast to fill the bladder, via the catheter.  Your daughter will probably be able to see this as well.  Eventually, her bladder will start telling her brain that she needs to urinate.  We want the bladder to get fairly full.  They are looking to make sure the valves at the UPJ (ureteropelvic junction-where the ureters enter the bladder) are competent.  They should not open and allow fluid from the bladder to enter the ureters.  Once your daughter feels full, she will be asked to pee on the x-ray table.  They will put towels between her legs, and she will be covered.  Peeing on the table is important, because sometimes with the pressure, the urine will leave the bladder and enter the ureter.  IF a patient cannot pee on the table (and some cannot for modesty issues), we will take out the catheter tube and have her pee in the toilet in private.  After emptying the bladder, she will be asked to hustle back to the x-ray table for a picture to make sure there is no contrast in the ureters.    There really is no side effects post procedure.  She will not leak contrast or have pain.  So whatever she wants to wear is fine.  The worst part of this study is the embarassment of the catheterization.  And as long as you are not pregnant, you should be allowed to wear a leaded apron and stay in the room with her, if she wishes.\\n\\nAnother good idea:  When they catheterize your daughter, you can get a \"clean catch\" of urine.  Make sure they give you some of this clean catch for testing.  When you urinate into a cup, it is possible for contamination from the labia etc.  A clean catch is just urine, and nothing else.  Our pediatric group in town always wants the parent to bring a clean catch to them so they can test it for bacteria.  Find out if this is something they want you to do before the procedure begins.  It may save your daughter from having to be catheterized for a clean catch later on.\n\nAnswer:",

These vary form radioisotope to another.  For example Carbon-14 has a half life of 5700 years.  This means that if I have 1 gram of carbon-14, 5,700 years from now I will end up with 0.5grams (the rest would have become Nitrogen with beta decay).  If another 5,700 years pass I end up with 0.25g (!) and not 0g as common sense would indicate.  Each time a half life passes HALF the nuclei decay!In fact 'activity' decreases as time passes.\\nAs said this time interval varies a lot.  The half life of Uranium-238 is 4,470,000,000 years, while that of thorium-230 is only 75,380 years.  Other half lives are quite short.  E.g. Iodine-131 has a half life of just 8 days and Sodium-24 has a half life of just 15 hours!\n\nAnswer:",

Eventually the decline becomes severe enough to interfere with daily activities and social relationships. \\nMany of the early symptoms of Alzheimer's disease are similar to the memory loss that occurs with normal aging, such as forgetting something you said earlier in the day. \\n\\nMore troubling symptoms may include: \\n\\nforgetting information you've just learned \\ndifficulty remembering the names of familiar objects \\nworsening confusion \\nchanges in behavior and personality \\na gradual inability to perform basic tasks \\nOf course, even symptoms characteristic of Alzheimer's disease may have other causes, such as a prescription medication. As you get older, your ability to metabolize medication changes. The dosage of a medication that was prescribed even a year ago may no longer be appropriate, resulting in symptoms such as confusion. \\n\\n\\nReaching a diagnosis\\nIf memory lapses or related symptoms begin to interfere with your daily life, consult your doctor. Often, input from loved ones and other close contacts can help the doctor determine the severity of your memory loss and other symptoms. \\nDiagnosing Alzheimer's disease can be stressful and time-consuming for both patients and their families. Proper diagnosis is the key to treatment and planning, however. And the sooner the better. Treatment is most effective when it begins in the early stages of the disease.\n\nAnswer:",

It occurs mainly, but not exclusively, in children. It is a common type of allergy, and is usually treated with an exclusion diet.\\n\\nSigns and symptoms\\n\\nPatients present with skin symptoms, throat tightness, shortness of breath, lightheadedness and/or stomach symptoms. The symptoms usually develop within half an hour of ingesting the allergen.\\n\\nRarely, food allergy can lead to anaphylactic shock: hypotension (low blood pressure) and loss of consciousness. This is a medical emergency. Allergens commonly associated with this type of reaction are peanuts, nuts, milk, egg and seafoods. Latex products can induce similar reactions.\\n\\nFood allergy is thought to develop more easily in patients with the atopic syndrome, a very common combination of diseases: allergic rhinitis and conjunctivitis, eczema and asthma. The syndrome has a strong inherited component; a family history of these diseases can be indicative of the atopic syndrome.\n\nAnswer:",

This knowledge is important for IRRIGATION, FERTILIZATION, and CULTIVATION. The amount and location of roots may be influenced by soil characteristics.\\n\\n2)Stems are generally upright and above ground, easy to locate and identify. However, many stems grow below ground or are ground-hugging. A modified stem is recognizable because it includes buds and sometimes leaves.  \\nBuds and shoots generally develop on stems.\\nThey carry nutrients and water from the roots to the other parts of the plant.\\nIn some cases, stems also store food. \\n\\n3)Nodes are places on the stem where leaves are attached and buds form.\\nRoots often form at nodes of creeping plants and when cuttings are taken for propagation.\\nInternodes are the segments of the stem between nodes.\\n \\nThe quality and amount of available light and temperature affect the length of the internode. The distance between nodes can be long or short. This distance reflects growing conditions. Plants grown under poor light conditions may be spindly, with very long, thin, and weak internodes. \\n\\n\\n4)Leaves are lateral outgrowths from the stem, most commonly flat, broad, and green. This maximizes their function of absorbing sunlight and transforming it into food. Leaves have evolved into many shapes and sizes, reflecting adaptations to the environment. Leaves generally consist of a stalk or PETIOLE and a blade or LAMINA. In simple leaves the lamina is in one piece. In compound leaves several pieces of lamina are joined to one petiole. \\n\\n\\n5)Buds are undeveloped shoots and flowers. Buds are classified terminal or lateral. Another term for terminal is apical. Terminal buds can be identified by their location at the tip of a stem. Lateral buds are located at the sides of the stem.\\n\\nFlower buds are normally larger than VEGETATIVE buds. Cabbage and head lettuce are examples of very large terminal buds. Brussels sprouts are edible lateral buds. Broccoli is an example of edible flower buds.  \\n\\n\\n6)The function of flowers is sexual reproduction through the production of seeds. A flower that has both male and female parts is called a perfect flower. Flowers that have only male or only female parts are called imperfect. A complete flower has four kinds of structure. Sometimes petals or stamens may be converted to nectaries so that it appears that there are other structures present. If a flower lacks one kind of structure it is said to be incomplete. The structures are arranged from the outermost inwards: The calyx is often green (but may be colored) and made up of two or more sepals  \\n    The corolla is often colored (but may be green) and made up of petals  \\n    The stamens are the male portion of the flower. Each consists of an anther, containing pollen supported by a stalk or filament  \\n    Pistils (there may only be one) are the female part. Each includes one or more ovaries where seeds will form, a stigma that captures and holds pollen, and a style that supports the stigma on the ovary. \\n\\n\\n7)A fruit is a ripened ovary or group of ovaries containing the seeds. It may include adjacent tissue that fuses with the ovary. Once the ovary is fertilized, the seeds develop and the ovary enlarges forming the mature fruit.  simple fruit forms from the ripening of the ovary of a single pistil. Examples include peanuts, sunflower seeds, grain (corn, barley, rice), acorns, walnuts, tomatoes, grapes, eggplants, citrus fruits, and apples.  \\n    Aggregate fruit form from flowers with several simple pistils, such as raspberries and strawberries.  \\n    Multiple fruit forms from a cluster of several flowers. A fruit is produced by each flower and these fruits merge into a multiple\n\nAnswer:",

Behind two doors is a goat or some other useless proze. Behind the third door is a valuable prize.\\n\\nYou are allowed to choose any one door (not knowing ahead of time which has the big prize). After choosing your door, and before any of them are opened, the game show host has one of the losing doors removed, and asks if you want to stay with the door you have already chosen or switch for the one remaining door.\\n\\nThe problem? Is it better to switch doors after one has been removed?\\nMany have answered \"yes\" and others \"no\". \\nI am interested in your thoughts and comments on this problem.\\nBest answer gets 10 points.\nAnswer: Using probability, you can show that it is better to switch.  It does raise your chance of winning a good prize.\\n\\nLet's think of this in terms of having two doors with a goat and one door with a car.  Thus, the probability that you originally picked the car is 1/3 and probability that you origianally picked a goat is 2/3.\\n\\nIf you picked the car (1/3 probability), then one of the two doors with a goat would be openned.  If you switch, then you get a goat automatically.  If you picked one of the goats (2/3 probability), then the other goat would be shown.  If you switch, you would win the car.  Thus, if you switch, you have a 1/3 probability of winning a goat and a 2/3 probability of winning the car.\\n\\nThink about if you kept your door.  The original probabilties would still hold.  1/3 probability of getting a car; 2/3 probabilty of getting a goat.\\n\\nWikipedia has a good discussion of this problem.  I especially like the tree diagram that is shown there.\n\nAnswer:",

Another form of synesthesia joins objects such as letters, shapes, numbers or people's names with a sensory perception such as smell, color or flavor.

As long as you remember that your client is right, think fast on your feet, and DO NOT under ANY circumstances loose your cool, you should be fine.

If not actually known at this time, is the actual size of the entire universe considered to be knowable (i.e. that there is some possibility of measuring or estimating its size but the techniques are not currently available).\\n\\nI've read that the universe is thought to be \"saddle shaped\"\\nand expanding at an accelerating rate.  If I correctly understand some research that I've done in Wickipedia, the rate of expansion of the universe is 70 (km/s)/Mps or 70 kilometers per second per megaparsec [i.e. million parsecs].\\n\\nI don't understand parsecs, except that they are a measurement of distance similar to light years.  Also, I don't understand the megaparsec part of the expansion rate. What does it mean for example, to say that the universe is expanding at a rate of 70 kilometers per second per (x number of light years)?\\n\\nOne more thing, I was not able to find a rate of acceleration of expansion. Would the form be increase of distance of expansion/s/s?\nAnswer: \"...What are the dimensions (length, width, and height or thickness) of the physical universe (in light years)?...\"\\nThe universe can't be measured in terms of length, width, and height. Such parameters require some reference point from which measurements can be made, along with some distant boundary where the measurement would end. You simply can't do that with the universe because the universe is isotropic, meaning it's the same in all directions from any observing point. From Earth we can look outward in any direction and 'see' about 13.7-billion light years. From Earth that represents a boundary. Here comes the tricky part: if some alien in a galaxy 13.7-billion light years away from Earth looked outward in all directions (including back towards Earth) they'd 'see' a universe that appeared to be 13.7-billion light years in scope. In other words, the universe has no boundary. To have one it would have to be inside some \"thing\" else, and there's absolutely no evidence that such is the case.\\n\\nTo confuse the issue even more, if we had the ultimate telescope with limitless viewing power we still will never be able to see into the universe beyond a certain range. That's because at almost the same instant of the Big Bang the universe briefly expanded faster than light (this doesn't violate relativity because it was the space of the universe that did the expanding). In our 'normal' universe the speed of light is the speed limit which prevents us from ever seeing any of that inflation because it's moving away faster than the speed of light.\\n-----------------------------------------------------------\\n\"...I've read that the universe is thought to be \"saddle shaped...\"\\nMore recent observations point more towards the universe being geometrically \"flat.\" This simply means that the universe appears to be infinite, that its space will expand forever while cooling more and more over the eons.\\n------------------------------------------------------------\\n\"...What does it mean for example, to say that the universe is expanding at a rate of 70 kilometers per second per (x number of light years)?...\"\\nYou've described the so-called Hubble Constant. (70 km/sec/Mpc) It means if galaxy 'A' is 1 Mpc (1-million ly) away from us it's recessional velocity will be 70 km/sec. If galaxy 'B' is 2 Mpc away then it's velocity will be 140 km/sec It's important to keep in mind though that it's space that's expanding like that, not the galaxies moving THROUGH space; they just get carried along.\\n------------------------------------------------------------\\n\"...I was not able to find a rate of acceleration of expansion...\"\\nI've been looking for a figure too. So far the only thing I've come up with is -3.15^36 /sec/sec  Darned if I know what the units of measurement are though. Maybe someone else on Yahoo can help us out with that.\n\nAnswer:",

Its population is 1,065,070,600 (2004 estimate). The overall population density is about 358 people per sq km (928 per sq mi). Many births and deaths are unregistered, but official data suggest that the birth rate in 2004 was about 23 per 1,000. Life expectancy averaged 64 years. Approximately 72 per cent of India\u2019s population lives in rural areas. Though living conditions in many areas have improved\u2014for example through the provision of clean water\u2014most people are still poor. About one third of the population lives on or below the UN poverty line; less than 3 per cent of Indian households have an income of more than US$2,500 a year.\n\nAnswer:",

Vick is a solid QB\nAnswer: Not a good week for either of them. That makes for a tough trade. I say trade for Vick though. He's a multidimensional player. If your league gives you points for rushing yards, scoop him up. \\n\\nMichael Vick has struggled in his last two games, and that should continue here. The Ravens have the kind of defense that makes things tough on quarterbacks; they have an aggressive secondary, and they bring a lot of pressure. For the season, they're allowing opponents to complete only 53 percent of their passes (3rd-lowest in the league), with twice as many interceptions (18) as touchdowns (9). They also rank among the leaders with 25 sacks. And with a lot of speed at linebacker, they're one of the few defenses that Vick might not run very successfully against. When Atlanta played Baltimore four years ago, Vick completed only 12 of 24 passes and finished with minus-5 rushing yards on his seven rushing attempts. In his three preseason appearances against them since that time, Vick has completed only 2 of 7 passes and run for only 8 yards on 2 carries, with 1 interception, 1 lost fumble and one broken leg. So this definitely looks like a game where he might put up some of his worst numbers of the season.\\n\\nManning is struggling. He's thrown only 2 TDs and completed just 52 percent of his passes in his last three games, and all of those were in the friendly confines of Giants Stadium. He hasn't thrown for even 180 yards in any of those games. Tough to see him rebounding on the road against one of the league's better defenses. The Jaguars have been especially tough at home, allowing only 4 TDs -- and a total of 37 points -- in five games. They also shut down a good Eagles offense in Philadelphia back in week 8. Manning is also dealing with the loss of Amani Toomer, out for the season with a knee injury, and will now be without left tackle Luke Petitgout, who broke his fibula last week and should miss the remainder of the season. One thing that can be said for Manning is that being on the road might help his game somewhat. The winds at the Meadowlands can wreak havoc with passing games; poor weather has been a factor in Manning's lesser numbers of late. Manning has posted far better numbers on the road thus far: 5 TDs and 4 interceptions in five home games, versus 10 TDs and 7 interceptions in four road games. With that said, though, only one of those four opponents, Dallas in week 7, had a defense the caliber of Jacksonville's. Don't expect big numbers from Manning in this one.\n\nAnswer:",

The first lecture was delivered in 975 AD. \\nLike many centers of learning, Al-Azhar University was originally intended as a place of worship and religious instruction. The mosque at Al-Azhar is one of the most famous in the Muslim world, and is still considered the seat of Sunni Islamic study. \\n\\nThe university pioneered systems of advanced academic instruction with its hierarchy of regular instructors and visiting professors. Its history follows the turbulent rise of the Islamic Empire, replete with political revolutions and competing religious philosophies. While Al-Azhar University has a storied history of religious instruction, it also boasts a robust secular curriculum, offering advanced degrees in engineering and medicine. \\n\\nAs with all matters medieval, historical facts and figures are up to academic interpretation. Qarawiyyin Mosque in Fez, Morroco, has also laid claim to the title of oldest university in the world. \\n\\nEurope's oldest university was founded in 1088 in the northern Italian city of Bologna. The United States's oldest university, Harvard, opened in Cambridge, Massachusetts, in 1636, not long after the first English colonists arrived in the Massachusetts Bay Colony. \\n\\n\\n\\n*Nalanda University and Takshashila University, both ancient schools located in India, predate Al-Azhar University.\n\nAnswer:",

And Who Invented It?\nQuestion: Id really like to know because I am a big time baseball fan.\nAnswer: The origins and evolution of the various bat-and-ball games are murky, and many believe that baseball is primarily an American invention. However, many believe that it originated as an adaptation of the game of rounders, and was also influenced by the rules of cricket. As far back as the 1870s, American newspapers were referring to baseball as \"The National Pastime\" or \"The National Game.\" An award-winning account of the origins of the game is David Block's Baseball Before We Knew It: A Search for the Roots of the Game (University of Nebraska Press, 2005). The publisher's description of the book notes that \"David Block looks into the early history of the game and of the 150-year-old debate about its beginnings. He tackles one stubborn misconception after another, debunking the enduring belief that baseball descended from the English game of rounders and revealing a surprising new explanation for the most notorious myth of all\u2014the Abner Doubleday\u2013Cooperstown story.\" In short, the debate on the game's origins may never be settled to everyone's satisfaction.\n\nAnswer:",

The White Sox are too tough for the Tigers, but the Tigers will get in with the Wild Card because they are beating nearly everybody else that they play.  \\n\\nThe Red Sox will come out of the East, but it's not going to be easy.  I just don't think that the Yankees can hold on with a shaky pitching staff; however, if the Unit comes around, and they make a move for another good starter, they could come out of the East.\\n\\nThe West is the hardest to tell.  Right now, the A's look like they will come out of it.  The Rangers have a good team, but you can't outscore everybody, and their pitching is not good enough to hold on through the whole season.  The Angels have looked bad this year, but can make a run once they get clicking, but it will be too little, too late.\\n\\nAnd seriously, does the person above realize he/she picked three teams out of the East?\n\nAnswer:",

Women inherit two X chromosomes -- one from each parent, written 46,XX.  Men inherit an X chromosome from their mothers and a Y chromosome from their fathers, written 46,XY.  Some individuals, however, have an additional X chromosome in their chromosomal arrangement, referred to as 47,XXY, or more commonly, just XXY.  The cause is unknown, yet XXY occurs in approximately 1 in every 500 to 1000 live male births, making it one of the most common chromosome variations.   The XXY variation is identified in an individual through a karyotype, a buccal smear, or FISH.\n\nAnswer:",

According to the Federation for American Immigration Reform (FAIR), an estimated 1.1 million immigrants, both legal and illegal, enter the United States every year. 700,000 of these are legal immigrants; 120,000 are refugees, and between 250,000 to 300,000 are undocumented or illegal \u201caliens\u201d ( Baldwin, 1995). The United States population at the moment is roughly 288 million people. If this trend of aliens is not decreased, the population will reach 400 million by 2050. How many people can America hold? \\n\\nProblem #2: Benefits Illegal Aliens Recieve \\n\\nCurrently, under federal law, undocumented foreign citizens are eligible for emergency healthcare, free schooling from kindergarten through high school, and W.I.C. or Woman, Infants, and Children nutritional program ( Baldwin, 1995). This is important to note because there are currently between eight and ten million aliens currently living illegally in the United States. An estimated 2.5 million of these illegal aliens currently reside in the state of California alone, due to the agricultural jobs that are readily available for cheap labor (Kadetsky, 102). It should not be surprising then that the residents of California were outraged over the amount of money that they were being forced to spend, and the amount of resources that were being used to support aliens that are not \u201callowed\u201d to be in the United States in the first place. \\n\\n\\n\\nProblem #3: Homeland Security\\n\\nIn the Fiscal year of 2002, which runs October 1 through September 30, the United States Coast Guard, which is the country\u2019s primary maritime, or sea going, law enforcement agency, intercepted 4104 immigrants from various South American countries (USCG, Para 2). Since then, the numbers of immigrants intercepted by the Coast Guard, has continued to climb at an alarming rate; jumping to almost 11,000 in 2004, 9,500 in 2005, and currently with less than two months into the 2006 physical year, there have already been 1,000 migrants accounted for and processed through the Coast Guard (USCG, Para 1). Illegal immigration can potentially cost American tax payers billions of dollars a year. The United States Coast Guard, whose primary obligation is to prevent the loss of life at sea, can not stop this problem by its self, it is mearly the first line of defense. It is up to the rest of America to join the fight and help put an end to this awful practice.\\ni couldnt agree more they should learn our language\n\nAnswer:",

Etna's eruptions, while obscuring visibility in the area surrounding the volcano, were captured by cameras on board the Terra and SeaWiFs satellites in recent days.\\n\\nThe eruption opened six vents in the mountain, releasing a cloud of ash stretching southeastward over the Mediterranean Sea, though the volatile mountain's lava flows have appeared to slowed.\\n\\nA new fissure cracked open at a height of 2,700 yards (2,470 meters) on the eastern side of the volcano, officials told Reuters on Tuesday, weakening the main lava flow that threatened the village of Nicolosi, a community of 5,000 people. \\n\\nThe magma pouring out of the new fissure, one of a half-dozen that have burst open on the almost 11,000-foot (3,350-meter) mountain, was heading toward the uninhabited Valle del Bove valley. \\n\\n\"There are very slight signals that the eruption activity is diminishing. I am cautiously optimistic,'' said Alberto Di Pace, prefect of Catania, a city at the base of the volcano. \\n\\nBut experts say the volcano is highly unpredictable, making it extremely difficult to tell whether the eruptions will stop soon. In the past 20 days there have been more than 2,500 tremors under the mountain, with no signs of any let-up. \\n\\nCatania's international airport, which was shut for a second time on Monday as thick layers of volcanic ash covered the runway, was re-opened at 6:00 a.m. on Tuesday. \\n\\nFor a week, Europe's most active volcano has been billowing huge clouds of smoke and black ash, and spitting rivers of lava, leading the government to declare a state of emergency. \\n\\nThe lava flow approaching Nicolosi has almost stopped as it pools in a shallow basin some 2.5 miles above the village. \\n\\nOn Sunday, the community organized a religious procession to pray that the flow be diverted or stopped. \\n\\nLegend has it that in 1886 the local archbishop managed to divert a wave of boiling magma descending on the village by brandishing before it a statue of Saint Anthony. \\n\\nThe magma has already damaged ski lifts dotting the volcano's slopes and civil protection teams were trying to save the ones left intact. \\n\\nMount Etna is a popular winter resort, but tourism officials say snow is unlikely to settle this winter because of the extreme heat of the lava. \\n\\nThe last time Etna posed a threat was in 1992 when lava streams headed toward Zafferana, a town of 7,000 people on Etna's lower slopes. The Italian military had to use controlled explosions to divert the flow.\n\nAnswer:",

Persons engaging in insurgency are called insurgents, and typically engage in regular or guerrilla combat against the armed forces of the established regime, or conduct sabotage and harassment in the land. The term \"insurgent\" is a pejorative from the point of view of the dominant or controlling authority\u2014one which presumes the political legitimacy of the dominant authority. From the point of view of the uprising, the term \"rebellion\" is preferred, and hence \"rebel\" is the common term.\\n\\nIn current usage, the term \"insurgent\" is commonly used in reference to the Iraqi insurgency\u2014armed rebels fighting against the newly-established civilian authority government in Iraq, and U.S.-led military occupation. In this context, the usage of the term \"insurgent\" has been criticized as biased, and tacitly accepting of any claimed legitimacy by the U.S. occupation and later coalition governments.\\n\\ninsurgent\\n\\nFunction: noun\\nEtymology: Latin insurgent-, insurgens, present participle of insurgere to rise up, from in- + surgere to rise -- more at SURGE\\n1 : a person who revolts against civil authority or an established government; especially : a rebel not recognized as a belligerent\\n2 : one who acts contrary to the policies and decisions of one's own political party\n\nAnswer:",

When I ask them what is the difference, they said \" Catholic believes in Virgin Mary and Christian does not\".  Can you list out what's the difference and who they worship?  I checked online and didn't give me such \\nexplanation.  Thank you very much.\nAnswer: We believe in the apostolic authority of the pope and the pope's infalibility in matters of faith and morals. People mess this up and say we worship the pope or believe he can't sin.\\n\\nWe believe that the Blessed Virgin Mary is to be honored above all other humans (except Jesus), and that she is the Mother of God incarnate. We ask her to intercede for us, just like you'd ask your best friend to pray for you. People misinterpret this and say we worship her. We worship God alone in the Blessed Trinity.\\n\\nWe believe that Jesus Christ instituted seven sacraments, or visible signs through which He gives us grace. All seven are biblical. (See http://biblechristiansociety.com and http://catholic.com for more information.)\\n\\nProbably one of the most central doctrines of our faith (Protestants reconize this as well) is the Real Presence of Christ in the Eucharist. Catholics take the Last Supper and John 6 literally. We believe the bread and wine becomes Jesus' Body and Blood under the appearances of Bread and wine.\\n\\nWe believe in salvation by God's grace alone. Not by faith alone, and not by works alone. We need faith and works, or faith working through love, as St. Paul puts it.\\n\\nWe also do not believe in sola scriptura, or scripture alone. We believe that Jesus left a Church to guide us (Mt. 16: 18-19) and that we need Sacred Traditon as well.\\n\\nThese are only parts of our beautiful faith. To learn more, see the websites mentioned above, as well as \\n\\nhttp://www.usccb.org/catechism/text/\\n\\nwhich is an online Catechism and holds everything Catholics believe.\\n\\nTo sum it up though,\\n\\nhttp://www.creeds.net/ancient/nicene.htm\\n\\nThis is the Nicene Creed which we say at each Mass as a congregation.\\n\\nGod Bless, hope this helps...\\n\\nA devoted Catholic Christian.\n\nAnswer:",

These conditions include those caused by: 1) a shift in body position from lying or sitting to a more vertical position (postural hypotension); 2) dehydration; 3) blood pressure medications; 4) diseases of the nerves to the legs of the elderly; 5) diabetes; or 6) Parkinson's disease. A decreased total blood volume and/or poor tone of the nerves of the legs from these conditions causes a disproportionate distribution of the blood in the legs, instead of up to the brain, when standing.\\n\\nOther common non-heart causes of temporary loss of consciousness include fainting after blood is drawn or after certain situational events (situational syncope), such as after urination, defecating, or coughing. This occurs because of a reflex of the involuntary nervous system (vasovagal reaction) that leads to slowing of the heart rate and dilation of the blood vessels in the legs, thus lowering the blood pressure. The result is that less blood (therefore less oxygen) reaches the brain as it is directed to the legs. With situational syncope, patients often note nausea, sweating, or weakness just before the loss of consciousness occurs.\\n\\nThe vasovagal reaction is also called a vasovagal attack. And situational syncope is also called vasovagal syncope, vasodepressor syncope, and Gower syndrome after Sir William Richard Gower (1845- 1915), a famous English neurologist.\\n\\nBrain stroke or \"near-stroke\" (transient ischemic attack) and migraines can also lead to temporary loss of consciousness.\\n\\nHeart conditions that can cause temporary loss of consciousness include abnormal heart rhythms (heart beating too fast or too slow), abnormalities of the heart valves (aortic or pulmonic valve stenosis), elevated blood pressure in the arteries supplying blood to the lungs (pulmonary artery hypertension), tears in the aorta (aortic dissection), and widespread disease of the heart muscle (cardiomyopathy).\n\nAnswer:",

The decomposition products have been identified by means of a mass spectrometer. The results of these two experiments suggest strong interaction between AP and PVP in the solid state. \\n\\n\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nDigital Object Identifier (DOI) \\n\\n10.1002/prep.19780030502  About DOI\\n\\n  \\n\\n\\nRelated Articles\\nFind other articles like this in Wiley InterScience \\nFind articles in Wiley InterScience written by any of the authors \\nWiley InterScience is a member of CrossRef.\n\nAnswer:",

Human hair from a grave in Africa proved to have only 51% of the carbon 14 living tissue. When was the body buried?\nAnswer: The its age is really close to 5730 years since almost 1/2 of the Carbon 14 remains.  The percentage left P = (1/2)^(T/H) where T is the time that has passed, and H is the half-life in years.  We know H is 5730 years, the current percentage left is 51% (0.51), and we want to find T.\\n0.51 = 0.5^(T/5730)\\nlogbase0.5 0.51 = T/5730\\nT = 5730 logbase0.5(0.51)\\nlog base 0.5 of 0.51 = ln(0.51) / ln(0.5) or 0.971431\\nSo T = 0.971431 x 5730 or 5,566 years ago\n\nAnswer:",

We have been divorced over 25 years but he came to my sister and I when he needed help of any sort. I had no objection to helping him out when I could since he was the father of my children but I am not financially able to handle his funeral expenses. I believe that his brothers and sisters expect me to. I really need advice on this one.\nAnswer: It really depends on the laws of your state, but usually what happens when a person dies intestate is that the court appoints an executor who is responsible for liquidating all the assets of the decedent's estate.  Before any friend or family member gets any money or property out of the estate, the executor has to pay for any claims made against the estate.  As a result, whoever pays for the funeral and burial expenses can make a claim against the estate for reimbursement.  In this case, I would strongly advise you against getting involved if you're worried about how you'll be able to pay for it and whether your ex has enough assets to cover the burial/funeral expenses.  Doesn't matter if his brothers and sisters expect you to handle this or not -- you are under NO LEGAL OBLIGATION WHATSOEVER to stump up the cash for anything involving your ex.\n\nAnswer:",

Kidney failure is a spectrum of disease - there are acute causes (that may be reversible) and chronic causes (with slow decrease in kidney function).  In the worse case senario with complete lack of function, death would occur in a week. \\n2) Dialysis can act as a bridge - to a kidney transplant if the damage is permanent, or until the body can heal itself and resume normal kidney function if the damage is not permanent.  \\n3) Dialysis also allows a means to take off extra body water.  Urination is the main way the body gets rid of excess water - if the kidneys are not working properly, you may or may not be able to produce any urine.  Extra water causes diffuse swelling in the body tissues, including the lungs (which may cause trouble breathing). \\n\\nThe cons:\\n1) Time.  Dialysis is done three times a week, usually for 3 hours.  For some people this may be done more frequently, especially if the nephrologist is trying to take off fluids.\\n2) Risk of infection.  In order to do dialysis, a very large catheter is needed to allow sufficient blood flow.  If known in advance, a fistula is placed into the arm, and a needle is inserted into it each time (A fistula is surgically created by connecting a large artery in the arm to a large vein - this gives a high flow system).  Otherwise, a catheter is placed into the jugular vein or the femoral vein.   These are prone to become infected - either in the skin around it, or by allowing introduction of bacteria into the blood stream.\\n3).  Medication changes.  Most medications have a known time that they are active in the body.  With renal failure, this is usually slowed down, but still occurs at a constant rate over time.  When dialysis starts, there is no longer a predictable amount of medication in your system.  Physicians have gotten pretty good at working around this, but it still can be an issue.\\n4).  Hypotension (low blood pressure).  With kidney disease, it is very important to keep the blood pressure low - this prevents further damage to the kidney (most people on dialysis have some residual kidney function - just not enough to be sufficient).  However, while dialysis is being done, there are large changes in the amount of blood/fluid in circulation in the body.  This can cause abrupt lowering of blood pressure.   \\n\\nIf the kidney damage is reversible - and the patient could eventually come off of dialysis, the pros definately outweigh the cons.   If the kidney damage is permanent, and the patient is not a candidate for transplant, this has to be a very individualized answer - depending on their values and quality of life, the scale could tip in either direction........\n\nAnswer:",

The particular bacteria might be resistant to whatever antibiotics they gave you.  You would need a culture of your snot to determine this.\\n\\nUltimately though, the problem probably started with poor sinus drainage.  Even with appropriate antibiotics, the problem will recur if the sinus drainage issue isn't resolved.  In the short term, Sudafed would probably help.  I don't like the idea of using Sudafed for more than a couple of weeks though.  If you have allergies exacerbating the situation (do you have a history of seasonal allergies, or any new pets?), then Benadryl or non-sedating Claritin would help.  For really bad cases, I know of a doctor that swears by the Neti pot (he uses it himself).  It's like a little watering pot for plants.  You fill it up with water or saline and pour it into your nose.  Basically you're physically cleaning out your sinus openings.\\n\\nIf there is a possibility you're allergic to something, I would try Claritin and the Neti pot first for 3 days and see if the symptoms improve.  If you don't think it's an allergy, try Sudafed + Neti pot.  If that doesn't do it, I would go back to the doctor and try another antibiotic together with the Sudafed + Neti pot.  VERY IMPORTANT: IF THE INFECTION SPREADS--YOUR CHEEK BECOMES RED AND PAINFUL OR IT HURTS TO MOVE AN EYE--GO STRAIGHT TO THE ER.  Sinusitis is normally just an inconvenience, not a serious health problem.  It can sometimes spread, however, and cause cellulitis in your cheek or an orbital abscess in your eye socket--both very serious conditions.\n\nAnswer:",

Early symptoms of type 1 diabetes are often polyuria (frequent urination) and polydipsia (increased thirst, and consequent increased fluid intake). There may also be weight loss (despite normal or increased eating), increased appetite, and irreducible fatigue. These symptoms may also manifest in Type 2 diabetes in patients who present with frank poorly controlled diabetes.\\n\\nThirst develops because of osmotic effects \u2014 sufficiently high glucose (above the 'renal threshold') in the blood is excreted by the kidneys but this requires water to carry it and causes increased fluid loss, which must be replaced. The lost blood volume will be replaced from water held inside body cells, causing dehydration.\\n\\nAnother common presenting symptom is altered vision. Prolonged high blood glucose causes changes in the shape of the lens in the eye, leading to blurred vision and, perhaps, a visit to an optometrist. All unexplained quick changes in eyesight should force a fasting blood glucose test. These are now quick (less than 5 minutes total), inexpensive (materials less than USD $1), and can be safely performed by almost anyone with trivial training.\\n\\nEspecially dangerous symptoms in diabetics include the smell of acetone on the patient's breath (a sign of ketoacidosis), Kussmaul breathing (a rapid, deep breathing), and any altered state of consciousness or arousal (hostility and mania are both possible, as is confusion and lethargy). The most dangerous form of altered consciousness is the so-called \"diabetic coma\" which produces unconsciousness. Early symptoms of impending diabetic coma include polyuria, nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain, with lethargy and somnolence a later development, progressing to unconsciousness and death if untreated.\n\nAnswer:",

Place a variety of feeders in your yard, including \"thistle\" feeders and suet feeders.\\n\\n2. Put a cage or screen around your seed feeders so only smaller birds can get to the food. Build your own using chicken wire or buy one of the commercial bird feeders made especially to solve this problem.\\n\\n3. Use a Hopper type feeder with a weighted perch that closes when a heavy bird (or squirrel) lands on it.\\n\\n4. Keep bird seed off the ground and stop filling your platform feeder for a week. Blackbirds and Starlings may get discouraged and move on.\\n\\n5. Shorten the perches on your tube feeders. The smaller birds (Goldfinches, Chickadees and Titmice) will be able to eat but larger birds will not be able to land.\\n\\n6. If Starlings are eating all your suet, try a feeder that required the birds to hang upside down. Woodpeckers can eat like that, but Starlings hate it.\\n\\n7. Never buy seed mixes containing milo. Blackbirds are the only birds that seem to like milo! Blackbirds also like millet and cracked corn, but few of the colorful songbirds eat these seeds. You might try offering safflower seeds instead of sunflower seeds in your tube feeders.\n\nAnswer:",

As long as your ear isnt turning red in that spot and staying red and that it isnt oozing good you should be fine. Wash your ears gentle with non scented anti bacterial soap and you should be on your way to healing fast :)\\n\\nHere is what you should do for taking care of your piercing:\\n\\nAlways wash your hands with soap and water before touching the pierced area or jewelry to keep bacteria from your hands away from the piercing site. Keeping the pierced area clean is the most important way to prevent infection. \\n\\nCleanse the piercing site with appropriate solution as frequently as recommended for that particular site, and for the full length of time recommended for healing. (See third paragraph.)\\n\\nKeep pierced area free of chemicals such as perfume, hair spray or hair gel. After showering, rinse the pierced area with clear water to remove soap or shampoo residue. \\n\\nDo not hold a public telephone against a newly pierced ear. Clean your telephone frequently with a disinfectant. \\n\\nFollowing ear or facial piercing, be sure your pillowcase is clean and changed frequently. \\n\\nA gauze pad or cotton swab can be used to clean crusts from around the jewelry. Use a new swab for each piercing site. Jewelry should be rotated once or twice while applying solution during each cleaning. \\n\\nEarrings should not be removed or changed for at least a month, and should be worn continually for the first 4 to 6 months. Other piercing sites may require more specific care. \\n\\nIf you do get an infection here is what you can do:\\n\\nIf signs of infection (increased redness, tenderness, heat, swelling) occur in a piercing that is through cartilage, seek medical treatment with antibiotics immediately.

For a pumpkin, it depends on where you are - some cuisines use pumpkin in the sweet course (like pumpkin pie), while others use it as a savory side dish.\\n\\nBotanically speaking, it is a fruit. However, \"vegetable\" is not a term that is used at all in botany. It doesn't refer to a specific plant structure and all botanical terms specify what part of the plant the items comes from. \\n\\nSo if you are going to insist that a tomato is a fruit, you should also point out that zuchinni and okra are also fruit; spinach is a leaf; rhubarb and celery are stems; carrots, radishes, and turnips are roots; broccoli and cauliflower are both flowers and stems; nuts, grains and legumes are seeds; and potatoes are specialized stems called tubers.\n\nAnswer:",

It weighs about 2.5 kilograms, with the female weighing in slightly less (by an average of 100 grams) than males. Other than weight and sex organs, aye-ayes exhibit no sexual dimorphism of any kind. They all grow to 30-37 cm from head to body, with a 44-53 cm tail.\\n\\n\"The adult Aye-aye has black or dark brown fur covered by white guard hairs at the neck. The tail is bushy and shaped like that of a squirrel. The Aye-aye's face is also rodent-like, the shape of a raccoon's, and houses bright, beady, luminous eyes. Its incisors are very large, and grow continuously throughout its lifespan. These features contrast its monkey-like body, and are the likely cause of why scientists originally deemed it to be a rodent.\\n\\n\"The Aye-aye's hands are arguably its most unique feature. Much like other primates, it possesses opposable thumbs, but both the hallux and the fingers are long and thin, and appear to be in a curved position somewhat similar to that of a fairy-tale witch when the muscles are relaxed. The middle finger can be up to three times longer than the others.\\n\\n\"Gestation for the Aye-aye lasts from 5 to 5 1/3 months. Births can occur at any time during the year, and females often wait 2-3 years between births. The infant takes about 7 months to be weaned, and stays with its mother for two years. The Aye-aye matures quickly; males rarely take more than 1 1/2 years to mature, and females take about an extra year. Lifespan is not known, but the world record is 23 years in captivity.\\n\\n\"The Aye-aye is classically considered 'solitary', but recent research suggests that they are more social than once thought. It usually sticks to foraging in its own personal home range, or territory. The home ranges of males often overlap and the males can be very social with each other. Female home ranges never overlap, though a male's home range often overlaps that of several females. Like many other prosimians, the female Aye-aye is dominant to the male. The Aye-aye is not monogamous by any means, and often competes with each other for mates. Males are very aggressive in this regard, and sometimes even pull other males off a female during sex. Outside of mating, males and females interact only occasionally, usually while foraging.\\n\\n\"After impregnating a female, the male usually stays in close proximity until the infant is born and has matured a bit. The father will sometimes share food with the infant, but otherwise infants' primary source of social interaction is with their mothers. Mothers and infants often wrestle, chase, and play \"peek-a-boo\" for entertainment. After 13 weeks, infants are usually ready to interact with other young Aye-ayes, usually by play-fighting.\"\n\nAnswer:",

The formula for adding the probabilities is valid only if the events are independent, like in this case. Otherwise you have to calculate the case when 2 events are simultaneously true and substract this from the sum: p(a OR b) = p(a) + p(b) - p(a AND b). Here you cant have 2 red beds and 2 green ones after 2 extractions, 2 red and two black, etc. So p(a AND b) in the above formula is 0.\n\nAnswer:",

Autism is classified as a Pervasive Developmental Disorder (PDD), which is part of a broad spectrum of developmental disorders affecting young children and adults--the Autistic Spectrum Disorders (ASD). The range of these disorders varies from severely impaired individuals with autism to other individuals who have abnormalities of social interaction but normal intelligence--Asperger's syndrome. The ways in which autism is exhibited can differ greatly. Additionally, autism can be found in association with other disorders such as mental retardation and certain medical conditions. The degree of autism can range from mild to severe. Mildly affected individuals may appear very close to normal. Severely afflicted individuals may be extremely retarded and unable to function in almost any setting.\\n\\nIn the past, autism has been confused with childhood schizophrenia or childhood psychosis. As additional research information about autism becomes available, the scope and definition of the condition continues to become more refined. Much of the past confusion about the disorder has been resolved.\n\nAnswer:",

In the duplicated state? fast help is appreciated.?\nQuestion: I need this for some homework and I can't find it anywhere, if you could let me know the answer I would be very greatful.\nAnswer: Chromosome Terms before and after DNA Duplication (Replication)\\nNote: Duplication and replication mean exactly the same thing.\\n\u2022 An unduplicated chromosome is one chromosome. A chromosome more or\\nless consists of two arms that extend from a narrow \"centralized\" region called\\nthe centromere. The centromere region is often visible when chromosomes\\nduplicate.\\n\u2022 When a chromosome duplicates, it becomes one duplicated chromosome,\\nand the two copies remain attached to each other. Note it is still one\\nchromosome.\\n\u2022 The two exact copies of the duplicated chromosome, which remain attached by\\nthe protein cohesin, are called \"sister\" chromatids. They are identical to\\neach other. It is essential that you remember this!\\n\u2022 At the centromere region of the duplicated chromosome, structures (made of\\nprotein and DNA) called kinetochores form during division. The three-layered\\nkinetochores attach to microtubules of the spindle during mitosis. The\\nkinetochores of the two sister chromatids face in opposite directions.\\nKinetochore \u2013 TEM\\n\u2022 After the identical sister chromatids are separated during mitosis, each (called\\na \"daughter\" chromosome now) becomes a single unduplicated chromosome\\nagain.\\nRemember: A chromatid must be attached to its identical chromatid and the two sister\\nchromatids comprise one duplicated chromosome. \"Sister\" chromatids are not two\\nchromosomes. They are one duplicated chromosome that consists of two identical\\nchromatids. Once sister chromatids are separated they are no longer chromatids!\n\nAnswer:",

Do Muslims believe in the virgin birth of Jesus?\\nFrom Huda,\\nYour Guide to Islam.\\nA.\\nMuslims believe that Jesus (called 'Isa in Arabic) was the son of Mary, and was conceived without the intervention of a human father. The Qur'an describes that an angel appeared to Mary, to announce to her the \"gift of a holy son\" (19:19). She was astonished at the news, and asked: \"How shall I have a son, seeing that no man has touched me, and I am not unchaste?\" (19:20). When the angel explained to her that she had been chosen for the service of God, and that God had ordained the matter, she devoutly submitted herself to His will.\\n\\nIn the Qur'an and other Islamic sources, there is no mention of Joseph the carpenter, nor any recollection of the inn and manger legend. On the contrary, the Qur'an describes that Mary retreated from her people (outside the city), and gave birth to Jesus underneath a remote date palm tree.\\n\\n?If Jesus was born conceived by God, how could he not be the Son of God?\nAnswer: We Muslims believe the following things about Jesus:\\n\\n1. We love Jesus & respect him as a major prophet of Islam.\\n2. We also love the mother of Jesus, the Virgin Mary. We believe she was a pious and noble woman chosen over all of the women of the world. \\n3. Muslims believe that Jesus was born miraculously of a virgin mother and no father. His birth is miraculous like the birth of Adam, the first human being, who was created with neither mother nor father. \\n4. Muslims do not believe that Jesus was the son of God. God is so powerful and self-sufficient that He does not need a son or any kind of partner. \\n5. In Arabic Bible the name for God is Allah. Therefore all Arab Christian call God Allah as Muslim do as well. \\n6. Jesus did not die on the cross. Rather, God saved him as his enemies were confused about him. Jesus was taken up by God to Heaven. \\n7. Jesus is called Isa (pronounced Eesa) in Arabic. \\n8. Jesus performed miracles by the Will of God, like healing the blind and those with leprosy. \\n9. Jesus prayed to the same God as all Prophets and we Muslims pray to. \\n10. Jesus will return before the end of the world. \\n\\nIf Jesus is a son of God, then the following things come up:\\n\\n1. Why Adam & Eve are not sons & daughters of God when God created them without parents?\\n2. What about all living beings which God created without both father & mother for the first time?\\n3. If Jesus was son of God, then why only 120 people accepted his prophethood at that time, rest of all spit on him, insulted him, terrorized him and eventually killed him (Christian belief) but God didn't save him?\\n4. If we take Jesus born without 'father' then how come God is his father?\\n5. As God is all powerful & compared to no one then how come he beget a son like humans?\\n6. God doesn't need any food nor any shelter. But why Jesus felt hungry and sought rest & comfort?\\n7. No one can do any harm to God, but how come people murdered Jesus?\\n8. God has no beginning & no end, how come Jesus was born & eventually died?\\n\\nYou do not have to answer these. There is no direct statement by Jesus himself that he came to fulfill this mission. He was very clear to tell people that God is my God and yours. He used to pray to God and ask Him for support and comfort. He never said, \u201cI am God\u201d or \u201cI am the Son of God.\u201d Rather, he was called several times in the Gospels \u201ca prophet\u201d and \u201ca mighty prophet\u201d. He was also called \u201cthe servant of God\u201d like Prophet Muhammad after him. People used to shout, \u201cHere a prophet has risen among us\u201d and repeated this phrase whenever Jesus performed a miracle in front of people. \\n\\nAll the things above I said from Islamic logic, it's not necessary for me to convince people to Islam. I just answered your question to inform \"What Why & How\" about islamic faith in Jesus. \\n\\nThank You. God bless everybody.\n\nAnswer:",

Without sufficient atmospheric pressure, body fluids will start to heat up and boil. Without oxygen, we would be unable to breathe. \\nThe parts of a spacesuit\\n\\nSpacesuits serve many functions. Today's spacesuits are pressurized, have an oxygen supply, protect the astronaut from micrometeoroid bombardment while spacewalking, and insulate the astronaut from the severe temperature changes experienced in space. The Space Shuttle astronauts have more than one \"outfit\" for space travel. What they wear while on a mission is determined by the job they are doing. During the launch and re-entry, the astronauts wear a partially pressurized suit and a parachute pack. The suit has a helmet, gloves, and boots which all serve as protection for the astronaut. Within the suit are bladders that automatically fill with air at reduced cabin pressures. At low pressure, the blood will pool in the lower body causing the astronaut to black out. The bladders maintain the pressure on the lower body to prevent this from happening. While working in the Shuttle during orbit, astronauts work in comfortable clothes such as knit shirts, pants, or flight suits. In addition, prior to each mission, flight crews are outfitted with lined jackets, sleep shorts, slippers, and underwear. \\nWhile working outside of the Shuttle during a mission, astronauts wear an extravehicular mobility unit (EMU). This suit has interchangeable parts so it can be assembled to fit different astronauts. This makes the suit more cost effective since it can be reused. The EMU has a liquid cooling garment, which is a one piece suit made of spandex, and keeps the astronaut cool while in the suit. The unit also contains headphones and microphones, a drink bag which carries water, a life support system containing oxygen, and a urine collection device. Gloves are included with the unit along with a helmet and a visor. All of this is necessary to protect the astronaut from micrometeoroids, solar radiation, infrared radiation, temperature changes, pressure changes, and oxygen deprivation.\n\nAnswer:",

If there are 4 grams of the isotope remaining?\nQuestion: a certain radioactive isotope has a half-life of 24,000 years. If there are 4 grams of the isotope remaining after 21,500 years, how many grams were there originally????\nAnswer: \"Give a student an answer, and their grade on that assignment will go up a point, teach them how to find their answer and their score on the final exam will improve!\"\\n\\nRadioactive decay is an exponential thing; for every 24000 years that elapses in this problem, half the remaining material vanishes.  If you express this as an algebraic equation you can figure this stuff out easily.  The hard part is figuring out the equation.\\n\\nLets say you start out with X_0 grams of material.  The amount of material remaining is X: \\n\\nX= X_0*(1/2)^(t/24000)\\n\\nWhere t is given in years.  See how this works?  if t = 0, then X=X_0*1/2^0 power.  Anything raised to the 0 is always 1, so X=X_0.  At t=24000 years, X=X_0*1/2^(1), so X=X_0*1/2; half as much is left.\\n\\nIn this problem you are given t, and X and are asked to find X_0 so  you use a calculator to turn 1/2^(21500/24000) into just a number and then you have\\n\\n4 grams=X_0*number\\n\\nPretty easy to solve that for X_0.  The point is, once you write down the equation that describes the system, you can manipulate it to solve for any of the terms in it, as long as you know the other two terms.\\n\\nIncidentally, I get a different answer than those other two folks who agree with one another.  They are wrong, but not by a lot.  Work it out for yourself.\\n\\n[Edit:  In fact I get the same result IMI does, so my method does work.

In return Zeus gave Amalthea the goat's horn. It had the power to give to the person in possession of it whatever he or she wished for. This gave rise to the legend of the cornucopia. The original depictions were of the goat's horn filled with fruits and flowers: deities, especially Fortuna, would be depicted with the horn of plenty.\\nIn modern depiction, the cornucopia is a hollow, horn-shaped wicker basket typically filled with various kinds of festive fruit and vegetables. The cornucopia has come to be associated with Thanksgiving.\n\nAnswer:",

The product could include anything from traditional goods and services, to celebrities, or works of entertainment.\\n\\nFrom a marketing perspective, publicity is one of the variables that comprise the promotional mix. The other components of promotions are advertising, sales promotion, and personal selling. Promotion is one of the variables that comprise the marketing mix.\\n\\nPublicity is closely related to public relations. Whereas public relations is the management of all communications between the firm and the general public, publicity is the management of product or brand related communications between the firm and the general public. It is primarily an informative activity (as opposed to a persuasive one), but its ultimate goal is to promote the companies products, services, or brands. A publicity plan is a planned program aimed at obtaining favorable press coverage for a companies products.\n\nAnswer:",

This might seem like a pipe dream, but these are the answers thrown up by a Times-CNN poll conducted in four metros. \\n\\nThe optimism however is tempered by a feeling that the country\u2019s infrastructure poses a challenge to its growth. The road ahead, many feel, is not so smooth, as structural and social issues could impede development. \\n\\nNearly 63 per cent respondents feel India\u2019s infrastructure will ultimately prevent it from becoming a global economic power. The feeling is more strong among respondents in Mumbai (77 per cent) and Kolkata (67 per cent), two cities that are coping with the hard realities of poor infrastructure. \\n\\nAsked whether the current government was adequately addressing the rich-poor divide, 58 per cent respondents felt otherwise. Gautam Nath, executive VP, TNS India explains, \"Respondents feel the government has not addressed the rich/poor gap problem adequately. \\n\\nIn Mumbai, the feeling has grown after the recent floods, which explains why 77 per cent Mumbaikars felt so strongly about infrastructure being an impediment to growth. Concerns such as the hike in petroleum prices, power problems, water crisis and rising costs of basic utilities make them feel the government has not been active where it should be.\" \\n\\nOf the four metros, the level of disillusionment with the government is higher in the National Capital (62 per cent) and the financial capital of the country (61 per cent) as compared to Chennai and Kolkata. In Kolkata, only 52 per cent feel strongly against the government. Perhaps, the socialist government there which actively promotes socio-economic parity has something to do with this mindset. \\n\\nOn HIV/AIDS, 52 per cent of all respondents felt the government had not done enough. Natural, considering that officially there are over 5.1 million HIV positive cases in India; unofficial estimates put the figure at around 8.5 million. And the numbers are growing. \\n\\nOn whether Bollywood would surpass Hollywood as the entertainment capital of the world, there was a marked divide between two cities with the highest stake in the Hindi-centric industry. Delhi (54 per cent) and Mumbai (49 per cent) had more Bollywood supporters than Chennai and Kolkata with their own established Tamil and Bengali film industries. \\n\\nNath says, \"The results show that the government, usually known for its lack of proactiveness and slow start, needs to prioritise its processes and public image.\" \\n\\n\\n\\nThe poll, conducted by market research firm TNS, was done in Delhi, Mumbai, Kolkata and Chennai. Seventy-five per cent of the respondents feel India could be the next superpower. What\u2019s more, 41 per cent felt Bollywood could one day surpass Hollywood. \\n\\nAlso, with India\u2019s GDP rivalling that of China, its firm commitment to democracy and a rapidly-growing rich and middle class, India\u2019s future superpower status is assured, they feel. Mumbaikars (84 per cent) are more optimistic about the future. Delhi (75 per cent), Chennai (70 per cent) and Kolkata (68 per cent) are not so gung-ho.\n\nAnswer:",

We've been together for 2 yrs.?\nQuestion: My boyfriend and I have been living together for 15 months and we have been together for 2 years. I mentioned marriage to him and he told me he wasn't ready. He said he wasn't even ready to be engaged. He told me he wanted to work on a couple of things first like getting better job and buying a house before getting married. He said he didn't know how much time it would take before he was ready for marriage. He then assured me he wanted to get married it's just not the right time. Should I wait for him? How much longer should I wait?\nAnswer: Marriage is a huge commitment. It is very good that he cares about you enough to wait until he has everything together. 2 years isn't really that long, especially if you are young. It sounds like you have a good man on your hands. I wouldn't worry, he will ask you when the time is right. Don't pressure him, it will push him away. My only caution is, there may never be a 'perfect' time to get married. He may not have his dream job.. and as far as the house, i would wait until after marriage and buy one together. \\n\\nIf you don't feel that he's worth waiting for then get out now\n\nAnswer:",

What worked/didn't work for you?\nQuestion: I have a friend who has been smoking for 12 years. She really wants to quit but struggles so badly with the psychological addiction. She has tried patches, gum and the tablet from the docs(cant remember the name). \\n\\nAny advice from people who have \"been there, done that\" would be appreciated.\nAnswer: I smoked for 11 years at it wasn't easy to quit.  What I found worked best was to make a list of all the time throughout the day when you usually have a smoke.  Take a good look at the list and decide which one you don't 'need'.  Cut that one out and do it for a week.  Then take another look at the list and cut another one.  Keep going as long as you have to to get down to none.  By the time you get to one, you usually have enough confidence in yourself to look at it and think \"I don't need this - it's not worth it.\"  It took me 11 weeks to quit that way because my average intake was 11 cigarettes (just over half a pack) a day.  By doing it this way, I didn't feel deprived because I knew my next smoke was just a few hours away.  I hadn't quit cold turkey and I made the decision as to which one to cut out and when.  It gave me a great feeling of empowerment.  I know it sounds like it would take forever this way, but slow and steady really does win the race.\\n\\nBest of luck!\n\nAnswer:",

The Kwans and their founders were the Chung Do Kwan (LEE, Won Kuk), Jidokwan (CHUN, Sang Sup), Chang Moo Kwan (YOON, Byung In), Moo Duk Kwan (Hwang Ki), and Song Moo Kwan (ROH, Byung Jick).\\n\\nAround 1953, shortly after the Korean War, four more Kwans formed. These 2nd generation Kwans and their principle founders were; Oh Do Kwan (CHOI, Hong Hi & NAM, Tae Hi), Han Moo Kwan (LEE, Kyo Yun), Kang Duk Kwan (PARK, Chul Hee & Hong Jong Pyo) and Jung Do Kwan (LEE, Young Woo).\\n\\nIn 1955, these arts, at that time called various names by the different schools, were ordered to unify by South Korea's President Syngman Rhee. A governmental body selected a naming committee's submission of \"Taekwondo\" as the name. Both Sun Duk Song and Choi Hong Hi both claim to have submitted the name. The name sounds like the ancient Korean martial arts of Taekkyon, as Taekwondo has direct relation to Taekkyon in the techniques.\\n\\nPlease read the below link for more information\n\nAnswer:",

But as Catherine had previously been married to Henry's eldest brother, Arthur, who had died in 1502, the king needed special permission from the pope for the marriage. In 1516 they had a daughter, Mary, who would later become queen of England herself.\\n\\nBy 1529, however, the king and Catherine had not yet managed to have a son. The birth of a male heir to continue the dynastic line was important for monarchs, especially a new house such as the Tudors. Henry needed a healthy son, and some advised him that Catherine's inability to provide one may be God's punishment against Henry for marrying his brother's wife. \\n\\n \\nSo the king asked Wolsey to go to the pope and ask for a divorce. The pope refused. Catherine was the niece of the new king of Spain, and Spanish troops threatened the Rome and the papacy. The pope therefore would not let the English king out of his marriage vows. \\n\\nHenry was angry at this. Wolsey was removed from office for his failure and the king moved to break away from Rome. He appointed himself as the Supreme Head of the Church of England and removed all powers from the pope over Englishmen.\n\nAnswer:",

It tastes a lot like white rice, but it has more nutrients.\\nhttp://www.foodsubs.com/Rice.html#converted\\nConverted rice: Converted rice has been soaked and steamed under pressure before milling, which forces some of the nutrients into the remaining portion of the grain so that they are not completely lost in the processing. Enriched parboiled rice is similar to regular enriched rice in terms of thiamin, niacin, and iron, but it has more potassium, folate (folic acid), riboflavin, and phosphorous, though not as much as brown rice. Converted rice takes a little longer to cook than regular rice, but the grains will be very fluffy and separate after they have been cooked. \\nhttp://www.wholehealthmd.com/refshelf/foods_view/1,1523,75,00.html\n\nAnswer:",

However, there is a vaccination for it.  With vaccinations, your own body's immune system fights the smallpox virus and prevents the disease.  On the other hand, medicine is a chemical substance that is introduced into your body and that substance actively treat the problem.  (The reason that I mention this is to point out the fundamental difference between vaccines and medicines.)\\n\\nHistorically, the first written account in the attempt to treat smallpox were Buddhist nun around 1022 to 1063 AD.  These nuns practice the process called \"variolation - a process of exposing a healthy person to infected material from a person with smallpox in the hopes of producing a mild disease that provided immunity from further infection.\" They \" would grind up scabs taken from a person infected with smallpox into a powder, and then blow it into the nostrils of a non-immune person. By the 1700's, this method of variolation was common practice in China, India, and Turkey. In the late 1700's European physicians used this and other methods of variolation, but reported \"devastating\" results in some cases. Overall, 2% to 3% of people who were variolated died of smallpox, but this practice decreased the total number of smallpox fatalities by 10-fold.\"\\n\\nEdward Jenner, an English physician, realized that milk maidens (females who milk cows) who developed cowpox, a less serious disease, were immune to smallpox.  He innoculated the pustules from the milkmaids to a small boy and later exposured the boy to smallpox.  The small boy did not develop small pox.  (As a footnote, this is medically and morally unethical to do today.)  Subsequently this became widely accepted and done.  (Another footnote, the word vaccine has its orgins here.  Vaca- is latin for cow).\\n\\nIn terms of using a weaker strain of small pox for a vaccine, Wyeth, the pharmaceutical company, was the first to market a smallpox vaccine.\\n\\nhttp://dermatology.about.com/cs/smallpox/a/smallpoxhx.htm\n\nAnswer:",

As formed in the liver, bile is a thin, watery fluid to which the gallbladder adds a mucous secretion, forming a complex thickened and stringy substance consisting of salts and bile salts, proteins, cholesterol, hormones, and enzymes. The gallbladder returns water containing salts and other materials to the circulation and concentrates the complex further by a tenfold reduction of the bile salts, which the liver synthesizes from cholesterol. Such foods as fats, egg yolk, and foods rich in cholesterol cause concentrated bile, together with secretions from the pancreas, to be discharged into the duodenum to promote digestion, to stimulate peristalsis and absorption, and to carry off excess cholesterol and the disintegration products of overage red blood cells. The hemoglobin of such disintegrating cells degrades rapidly into reddish-yellow bilirubin, predominant in the bile of carnivorous and omnivorous animals, and biliverdin, a green pigment that appears in the bile of herbivores. Under normal conditions, the liver efficiently clears these pigments.\\n\\nCertain conditions create an inability to excrete bile, and this may create serious disabilities, such as jaundice. In obese and immobilized persons, in pregnant women, and in cases of obstruction of flow of bile, gallstones may be formed by precipitation of bilirubin in combination with calcium and cholesterol. Stasis frequently coexists with inflammation and infection of the gallbladder; this may alter the concentration of bile constituents and create debris around which bile and its components may precipitate to form gallstones, which may then block the common bile duct to reduce or stop the flow of bile. Inflammation and infection, together with the consequent regurgitation of bile into the liver, may damage that organ, sometimes causing cirrhosis.\\n\\n\u00a9 1993-2003 Microsoft Corporation.

The Twilight Zone. Hoodoo Sea. The Devil's Triangle. The vast three-sided segment of the Atlantic Ocean bordered by Bermuda, Puerto Rico and Fort Lauderdale, Florida, did not receive its most famous nickname until 1964, but reports of bizarre happenings there, or nearby, have been recorded for centuries. In fact, many claim that Christopher Columbus bore witness to the Bermuda Triangle's weirdness.\\n\\nAs the Nina, the Pinta and the Santa Maria sailed through the area in 1492, it is reported that Columbus's compass went haywire and that he and his crew saw weird lights in the sky, but these events have mundane explanations. From the account in Columbus's journal, it is thought that his compass's slight inaccuracy stemmed from nothing more than the discrepancy between true north and magnetic north. As for the lights, Columbus wrote of seeing \"a great flame of fire\" that crashed into the ocean -- probably a meteor. He saw lights in the sky again on October 11, which, of course, was the day before his famous landing. The lights, brief flashes near the horizon, were spotted in the area where dry land turned out to be.\\n\\nAnother historical event retroactively attributed to the Bermuda Triangle is the discovery of the Mary Celeste. The vessel was found abandoned on the high seas in 1892, about 400 miles off its intended course from New York to Genoa. There was no sign of its crew of ten or what had happened to them. Since the lifeboat was also missing, it is quite possible that they abandoned the Mary Celeste during a storm that they wrongly guessed the ship could not weather. But what makes it even harder to call this a Bermuda Triangle mystery is that it the ship was nowhere near the Triangle -- it was found off the coast of Portugal.\\n\\nThe Bermuda Triangle legend really began in earnest on December 5, 1945, with the famed disappearance of Flight 19. Five Navy Avenger bombers mysteriously vanished while on a routine training mission, as did a rescue plane sent to search for them -- six aircraft and 27 men, gone without a trace. Or so the story goes.\\n\\nWhen all the facts are laid out, the tale of Flight 19 becomes far less puzzling. All of the crewmen of the five Avengers were inexperienced trainees, with the exception of their patrol leader, Lt. Charles Taylor. Taylor was perhaps not at the height of his abilities that day, as some reports indicate that he had a hangover and failed in his attempts to pass off this flight duty to someone else.\\n\\nWith the four rookie pilots entirely dependent on his guidance, Taylor found that his compass malfunctioned soon into the flight. Taylor chose to continue the run on dead reckoning, navigating by sighting landmarks below. Being familiar with the islands of the Florida Keys where he lived, Taylor had reason to feel confident in flying by sight. But visibility became poor due to a brewing storm, and he quickly became disoriented.\\n\\nFlight 19 was still in radio contact with the Fort Lauderdale air base, although the weather and a bad receiver in one of the Avengers made communication very spotty. They may have been guided safely home if Taylor had switched to an emergency frequency with less radio traffic, but he refused for fear they would be unable to reestablish contact under these conditions.\\n\\nTaylor ended up thinking they were over the Gulf of Mexico, and ordered the patrol east in search of land. But in reality, they had been heading up the Atlantic coastline, and Taylor was mistakenly leading his hapless trainees much further out to sea. Radio recordings indicate that some of them suggested to Taylor that Florida was actually to the west.\\n\\nA search party was dispatched, which included the Martin Mariner that many claim disappeared into the Bermuda Triangle along with Flight 19. While it is true that it never returned, the Mariner did not vanish; it blew up 23 secon\n\nAnswer:",

Does anyone know more about it, and know where I can find more information about it?\nAnswer: The Spooklight, also called the Hornet Spooklight or Devil's Promenade, is a mysterious visual phenomenon allegedly experienced by witnesses in a small area known locally as the \"Devil's Promenade\" on the border between southwestern Missouri and northeastern Oklahoma west of the small town of Hornet, Missouri. Despite the fact that it is named after a small, unincorporated community in Missouri from which it is most commonly accessed, the light is most commonly described as being visible from inside the Oklahoma border looking to the west. The Spooklight is commonly described as a single ball of light or a tight grouping of lights that is said to appear in the area regularly, usually at night. Although the description of the light is similar to that of other visual phenomena witnessed throughout the world, the term \"Spooklight\" when standing alone generally refers to this specific case. Numerous legends exist that attempt to desribe the origin of the Spooklight, one of which involves the ghosts of two young Native American lovers looking for each other.\\n\\nAccording to most accounts, it has appeared continually since the late 19th Century, although it was generally not well-known to anyone but locals until after World War II. Some date the first encounters with the light back to the Trail of Tears in the 1830s. However, the first documented sighting is generally accepted to have occurred in 1881, although some report sightings as far back as 1866. The earliest published report dates back to 1936 in the Kansas City Star. In 1946 the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers supposedly studied the \"Hornet Light\", but could not find a cause for it. In their words, it was a \"mysterious light of unknown origin\". Early residents of the area reported seeing lights in the forest, over their land, or even in their yards. During the 1960s, there was a general store in Hornet that gave out information about the light to sightseers. It included a \"Spooklight museum\". There have also been various establishments along the Missouri-Oklahoma state line that served a similar function, but they have since closed. During the 1960s and 1970s the roads where the Spooklight usually appears were often packed with parked vehicles and people hoping to get a glimpse of the mysterious light.-\n\nAnswer:",

Bird flu is just one of them. I copied some facts from the website listed below, there is a lot of useful info there. \\n\\nIt's hard to say where the various strains of flu come from. The best way to try to prevent it is by washing frequently or using hand sanitizer. \\n\\nBefore I start work everyday, I sanitize my keyboard, and my telephone in case someone before me was using it and  you know, knock on wood, I have not been sick this year. Maybe a slight cold, but not the flu. \\n\\nMind you, you may not be fortunate enough to escape it, but keeping your hands and property clean are great precautious measures. Check this info out and go to the website as well ;)\\n\\nWhat Is the Flu?\\nFlu is the common name for influenza (pronounced: in-floo-en-za), a virus that attacks the respiratory system.\\n\\nThere are three different types of the flu virus. Types A and B can cause widespread flu outbreaks (although type B usually causes less severe symptoms than type A). Type C is fairly rare and causes only mild symptoms.\\n\\nUsually when you're sick with a virus, your body builds up a defense system by making antibodies against it, so you don't get that particular virus strain again. Unfortunately, flu viruses mutate (change) each year, so you aren't protected from the disease forever. Some years the change in the flu virus is slight, so even if you get the flu it's a mild case because the antibodies give you partial protection. But every 10 years or so the flu virus undergoes a major change, and many people get severe cases. These large-scale outbreaks are called epidemics. If they spread worldwide, they're called pandemics.\n\nAnswer:",

This also works for other things, like a solution of water and alcohol.  Since alcohol has a lower boiling point (meaning that it has a higher vapor pressure at a given temperature than water), it will evaporate quicker than water when you heat the solution.\\n\\nWhen you lower the pressure above a liquid, the liquid boils at a lower temperature.  A liquid will boil when its vapor pressure eqauls the pressure above the liquid, so if you lower pressure, you lower its boiling point.\\nWhen you lower the pressure substancially (like with a vacuum) liquids will boil much easier (some even at room temperature), meaning that you do not have to heat them up quite as much in order to boil them.\n\nAnswer:",

Many of them are listed by some of these replies. Yes they are real.\\n\\nThey were set up by FHA and heavily lobbied by AARP in order to help Senior citizens because they know that social security and pensions do not cut it for a lot of people.\\n\\nI recommend going to aarp to find some really helpful information.\\n\\nhttp://www.aarp.org/money/revmort/...\\n\\nor here for the most frequently asked questions..\\n\\nhttp://www.griffinloans.com/faqs.html...\\n\\nThere really is only one downside to taking out a reverse mortgage. The children are not left with 100% of the value of the home for an inheritance. From my experience and my own personal view, most children would want their parents to live their life to the fullest and don't care if part of their inheritance is reduced. It is YOUR home and you worked hard to pay for it. You should enjoy the benefits of it.\\n\\nThe house is still in your name it just shows that there is a mortgage on the home like any other conventional mortgage. You can take the full amount in a lump sum, split it up in monthly payments or leave it in a line of credit which right now has a growth rate of about 7%. With the line of credit you are only charged interest on what you pull out of the line of credit and that interest rate right now is right around 6.5%. The rest of the money sits there untouched until you need it. These loans are set up so that there should always be equity in the home to pass along to your heirs. Also, you can repay the loan at anytime with no prepayment penalty.\\n\\nAll of this money is tax free and there are no monthly payments to make. You CAN make a payment if you want and are concerned about keeping the balance down. You even get a tax break if you pay back the interest you are being charged.\\n\\nThis is a much better option than a home equity loan which you have to make high monthly payments and if something happens and they get behind could lose their home. With an FHA reverse mortgage there is NO way to ever lose your home or be foreclosed on.\\n\\nSo really the only downside to reverse mortgages is that the heirs wouldn't get 100% of the home value for your inheritance.\\n\\nI'd be happy to send you some more information if you would like. This is what I specialize in and our company can do reverses almost anywhere in the country. If you would like some more information please email me at bburns@griffinloans.com\n\nAnswer:",

Problem is, I get really nervous when standing in front of a class to present. My English teacher gave us some helpful hints as to not getting shy and nervous in front of the class, but can anyone else explain a bit more thoroughly? Thanks in advance.\nAnswer: I am a teacher who also gets very nervous when doing a presentation or workshop in front of my peers, so try these tricks:\\n\\n1) Practice, practice, practice.  Rehearse in front of your family, friends, a mirror, whatever.  The more you know the material, the easier it will come.  Alot of the times you may get nervous because you are afraid you are going to screw up or look silly.  If you have what you are going to say down, that should help.  \\n\\n2) Before you go up, use the restroom.  On the way there, take big strides and swing your arms steadily.  Your goal here is to burn off the extra adrenaline and rthe exercise will help you relax.\\n\\n3) I cannot remember the proper name for this technique, but it DOES work.  Breathe in, tighten your stomach muscles, working from the top ones down to the bottom ones.  What you are doing is burning off excess adrenaline and at the same time breathing slower and deeper.  I use this one every time and it works great.  Once you have finished with the bottom muscles, exhale and repeat.\\n\\n4)  Relax...Breathe in slowly, hold your breath for 4 to 5 seconds, then slowly exhale.\\n\\n5)  Remember... that nobody sitting there is judging you.  They all understand how nerve racking it can be to speak in public.  They want you to succeed.\\n\\n6)  Pick one friendly, smiling face in the crowd and focus on that one person.  This doesn't mean that you don't scan the room and present to the class, but always return your focus to that one person and you will be ok.\\n\\nHope this helps!\\n\\n\"There are two types of speakers: those that are nervous and those that are liars\". - Mark Twain\n\nAnswer:",

Can these equipment work without computer?  Can these equipment work on its own i.e. independent of computers?  I need to prove that networking  equipment are computer related and cannot work without connecting to computer(s) or without the help of computers.  Networking equipment transfers data between two or more computers or related equipment.\nAnswer: That's a fairly broad question, and it may help to know why you need to prove that these are one or the other.\\n\\nRouters, hubs, and switches would normally be considered computer-related.  Although some may argue that some of these, especially routers and some switches that have their own operating system and do some 'computational' work could technically be called computers.  Most in the industry, given the choice, would still call these computer-related.\\n\\nA modem is computer-related.  Not likely to get much of an argument there.\\n\\nFirewalls would normally be considered computer-related.  Although they can also run their own operating systems and be considered 'computer' devices.\\n\\n\"Storage\" .. not sure what you intend for this one.  Network attached storage? Some kind of SAN?\\n\\nServers are definitely computers, no question.\\n\\nNow for the more interesting part of your question, \"I need to prove that networking equipment are computer related and cannot work without connecting to computer(s)...\"\\n\\nIt really depends on what you mean by 'cannot work.'  A router can 'work' without being connected to a computer.  You can boot it up, start the operating system, connect it to a network of other routers, etc and it can 'do' a lot of things, but it would not being doing what it was intended to do.  \\n\\nI think you are on the right track of answering your own question.  \"Networking equipment transfers data between two or more computers or related equipment.\"  Except for including servers and storage in your original list, I think you've answered yourself.\n\nAnswer:",

If glass cost 1.88 times as much as the brick wall per linear foot, what should be the dimensions of the building so that the cost of material for the walls is a minimum?\nAnswer: Thinking about this intuitively, if the cost for all 4 walls was the same, what design would give you the smallest perimeter of a rectangle where the product of the sides is 14,400?  That would be a square.  Now, you can see that because that one wall has a greater cost, you want to make that wall's length less (which means making the corresponding back wall less, and the sides grow longer).  But at some point we lose so much efficiency (because the side walls get SO much longer that the total price goes up, that we start paying more. We need to figure out at what point the cost of the front + back walls equals the cost of the side walls. \\n\\nLet's develop a couple of formulas.\\n\\nlet c = the cost/linear foot, x = length of one wall (we will arbitrarily assume that x and it's partner x' will contain the glass), y = length of an adjacent wall.\\n\\nThen total cost = c*x + 1.88*c*x +2*c*y or simply 2.88*c*x + 2*c*y\\n\\nThe total square footage of 14400 is equal to x * y:  x * y = 14400\\n\\nSince we already observed that the greatest economy is found when the cost of the front and back walls (2.88*c*x) is equal to the cost of the side walls (2*c*y) we can solve this equation:\\n\\n2.88*c*x = 2*c*y; or 1.44*x = y\\n\\nsubstitute for y in: x * y = 14400 yields:\\n\\nx * 1.44*x = 14400, which simplifies as:\\n\\n1.44*(x^2) = 14400, which when solved yields:\\n\\nx = 100 feet\\n\\nThis implies that y = 144 feet.\n\nAnswer:",

It is caused by an allergic reaction to gluten/gliadin proteins in wheat, rye and barley.  \\n\\nThe only treatment is nutritional - avoidance of the foods that contain the proteins.  Medical doctors may miss this common condition (often misdiagnosed as IBS) because it is a nutritional problem and there is no drug treatment.  It is well documented that medical doctors have almost no training in nutrition and receive most of their continuing education knowledge from the drug companies.\n\nAnswer:",

Chiefly from two components of food, in fact. Carbohydrates are made of carbon and hydrogen (sugars, starches, etc), and fats (oils) which are more complex shemically (butter, olive oil, etc).\\n\\nTo produce the energy cells need in the form they need it, to do their function, these are burned (in a clever and flameless way) indside the cell. The end products of complete oxidation are carbon dioxide and water. The oxygen necessary comes from air, through the lungs. \\n\\nThe more energy your muscles need (because of exercise) the more fuel is burned and the more carbon dioxide and water is produced. The carbon dioxide is exhaled (through the lungs) and the water is excreted by the kidneys. Both are carried by the blood from the muscles to the lungs or kidneys as needed. \\n\\nSo the more your exercise, the faster you breath and the more oxygen you take in and the more carbon dioxide you exhale. If you run for one hour, you'll produce a certain amount of carbon dioxide and if you run for 2 hours you'll produce just about twice as much. but, even if you're sleeping, you'll still produce carbon dioxide for many parts of your body still have to do some work even if you're not running around. Your heart still beats, your brain still works (dreams, maybe) and you still stay about the same temperature. All that takes energy, just not so much as you need when you're running. \\n\\nAnother source of carbon dioxide, a much bigger source than humans running around on a soccer field, or a baseball diamond, is burning fossil fuels. Gasoline, diesel fuel, coal, heating oil, ... all produce carbon dioxide and water (and heat) as exhaust products. All that carbon dioxide being put into the air is one of the causes, most people think the major cause, of the rise in average temperature on the Earth. This is the global warming that's been in the news.\n\nAnswer:",

A chaplin from a nursing home would come to visit with him, when my uncle got to sick to take care of he was placed in a nursing home. After his death the chaplin from the nursing home told me that during one of his home visits my uncle confessed to inappropriatly \"touching\" my 8 year old son when my son was 6. The chaplin said he did not tell me until after my uncles death beacause my uncle asked him not to until he passed away.Can I take any legal action against this chaplin since he knew about this and did not tell me until after his death even though the chaplin knew that I was taking care of my uncle in his home with my son there??\nAnswer: The chaplin is bound by privilege.  He cannot reveal any information that your uncle told him in confidence.  Even if he were a mandated reporter (I'm not so certain that he is) that mandate would only extend to those things he witnessed.  If the only information he had was from your uncle, then he is bound by privilege and could not legally disclose the information until after your uncle died (the privilege dies with the person.)\\n\\nI know that you must be very upset but the Chaplin is more than likely a dead end from a civil lawsuit standpoint.  However, did your uncle die with money?  If he has an estate, then you might be able to sue the estate.  The estate remains liable for any claims of injury against the decedent.  Talk to a lawyer as soon as possible.  If your Uncle's estate has already gone through probate, or is currently in probate, there is going to be a fairly short window of time within which to bring this claim.  Technically, the statute of limitations for claims owned by minors does not run until they reach the age of majority.  However, in this case, you have a quickly diminishing pile of money.  You need to jump on this as soon as possible.\\n\\nGo to www.martindale.com for a listing of lawyers in your area.  Talk to a personal injury lawyer.  That's probably your best bet.  Make sure it's one that is familiar with the claims reporting procedures against a decedent.\\n\\nFeel free to contact me through this service for any advice.  Understand, though, that I'm a California lawyer.  The laws in your state may be different but probably not dramatically so.\n\nAnswer:",

So far, bird flu has only been passed from birds either to other birds or, in isolated cases, to humans. However, if the flu mutates into a strain that can pass from human to human, people will have no immunity and the flu will probably pass rapidly from person to person, creating a pandemic. Flu vaccines can only be made to protect against a particular virus, and, since the virus has yet to be passed from human to human, no vaccine can be developed.\\n\\nIn Asia, many people live with ducks and chickens in their homes and in their yards. Health and veterinary officials worldwide recently announced that a key way to stop the spread of the disease is to improve farming practices, segregating poultry from humans, and culling birds that have been infected with the deadly virus.\\n\\nWhat's next? When asked for predictions as to the seriousness of the pandemic, should one occur, experts have based their projections on a similar pandemic that occurred in 1918-1919. Up to a billion people fell ill, and nearly 100 million died worldwide. Translating to today's figures, they project that some 30-60 percent of the world's population could be infected by the virus, and over 300 million people worldwide could die. In the meantime, good hygiene remains the best prevention: keep hands well-washed, and avoid contact with people who have been infected with the virus.\n\nAnswer:",

I heard he gave his bail bondsman his sisters address, but I recieved paperwork from a law firm addressed to him.  I opened it up (he and our son have the same name).  It was his plea agreement paperwork.  He has never lived at my address.  Now my question is if he does not show up for court are the police going to come to my house and serve the warrant?  I could care less if they come when our children are gone I'll be happy to give them his whereabouts.  I just don't want the police to show up at my house and scare the hell out of my kids.  Thank you.\nAnswer: Well, the police aren't going to show up and serve the warrant because he's not there to serve the warrant on, right?  \\n\\nThey might very well come looking for him there, though, because evidently he has used his address with his lawyer (though the police almost certainly don't have access to that information).  \\n\\nWhether they might come or not, why not head this thing off at the pass?  You've said you're okay with them showing up if the kids aren't home and you'll give them your ex's current whereabouts, so why not just cough it up right now and hopefully keep them from even showing up at your door?\\n\\nSome ways to do that which would likely be the most effective:\\n\\nWrite a letter to the court he's being prosecuted in and give them his current address.  \\n\\nWrite another letter to the prosecutor's office (just a photocopy of the court's will do), and tell them the same thing.\\n\\nWrite a letter (again, photocopies are probably fine for all of these) to the police department or sheriff's office that would likely serve the warrant, if there was one issued.\\n\\nYou might even want to consider returning the paperwork to the attorney's office with a note that if he fails to show up, you'll gladly give his correct address to anyone who asks for it.  \\n\\nAll this letter-writing should also take into account your risk for doing so.  If you think he'd take violent exception to your actions, you might not want to do it in a way that he'd know it was you.  If you'd like, enable the Yahoo!Answers user-to-user email, and I can send you a suggestion for how to do that.\\n\\nYou might also check with the court to find out what his next appearance date is - that is probably public information, no matter what state you're in.  Explain why you want to know, and ask if they will tell you (if you call after that date) if he showed up or not.  If he showed up, then this is all moot.  If he didn't, then you might want to consider writing those letters.\\n\\nBest of luck!\n\nAnswer:",

Please read for details! Could they be cancerous?\nQuestion: They seem to have appeared overnight, are evenly raised, slightly bumpy, and are unevenly colored (ranging from deep brown to lighter freckle-colored). \\nThey are 4.5 cm apart, and the first of the two is larger in size (approximately  4 cm in height and 2 cm in width) and the comparatively smaller of the two is approximately 1.25 cm in height and 1.5 cm in width.  \\nThey are located approximately 4 cm below the bottom of his left shoulder blade.\\nA history of cancer runs on both his maternal and paternal sides of his family, esp. skin cancer (his father, amoung others). He is very fair, but has limited sun exposure. (If only I could convince him to wear sunscreen everyday, and not only when he goes outdoors.... : ) ).\\nI am sorry to be so long winded, but I am sick with concern.\nAnswer: It's really hard to 'diagnose' from a computer - so try this - and also skin cancer isn't always caused by sun expsoure.  :)  Have him see a dr or a dermatologist to rule it out and put your minds at ease though.  :)  I know very fair skinned folks have to be checked at least once a year (personal experience), so it'll be good for him to go.  But here are some good guidelines.\\n\\nThe ABCs of melanoma\\n\\nA is for \"asymmetry\" - When you're looking at moles, you want to tell your doctor or dermatologist about moles that are asymmetric, or unevenly shaped and not the same size on all sides. \\n\\nB is for \"border irregularity\" - suspicious moles have an irregular shape or fade into the background. \\n\\nC is for \"color\" - check for moles that are more than one color. An even dark brown is considered normal. But moles that have multiple colors in them or black, red, white or pink moles are more worrisome. \\n\\nD is for \"diameter\" - Moles greater than six millimeters, which is about the size of a pencil eraser, should be examined. \\n\\nE is for \"evolving\" - Some experts are now adding a letter to the ABCs, which is an E for \"evolving.\" Any changes you notice over time in a mole or a skin lesion with respect to size, color and shape should be evaluated promptly by your dermatologist. If a mole is changing color or shape or it's smaller than a pencil eraser diameter and getting bigger, it should be examined by a dermatologist. Other changes in moles like inflammation, pain, crusting or bleeding should also be examined, but not all changes in moles mean it's malignant melanoma.\n\nAnswer:",

I just have questions of those who worship other cources of god such as, Allah, Buddah, etc. Are they going to hell? Who's to say? I  mean, for those people with good hearts, philantropy and altruism, humanity, meditation and respect for this earth at the fore front everyting they do. Will they go to hell if they don't accept Jesus? I want to cry this hurts so bad.. The not knowing ya know?  I am really trying to find ansers.

If others who follow different faiths continue, will they go to hell?Then others talk of reincarnation, and past lives, does Jesus promote that way of thinking?? The guilt of not knowing.. thanks..\nAnswer: Jesus is God. Christians who say otherwise either do not know the fundamentals of the faith, are apostate, or are heretics. The Apostle's and Nicene Creeds both affirm this doctrine, and the biblical evidence is overwhelming.\\n\\nJesus said of Himself that He was God. He applied the name of God, \"I AM,\" to Himself in several passages. Here's a few examples: Matthew 14:27, Mark 6:50, Mark 13:6, Luke 21:8, John 4:26, John 6:20, John 8:24, 28, 58, and John 13:19. (Some English translations have mistranslated the words \"I am\" to \"It is I,\" or \"I am He.\")\\n\\nJesus received worship, which is reserved only for God:\\n\\n\"Then the men in the boat began to worship Jesus, saying, \"You certainly are the Son of God!\" (Matthew 14:33)\\n\\n\"Suddenly Jesus met them and said, \"Greetings!\" They went up to him, took hold of his feet, and worshiped him.\" (Matthew 28:9)\\n\\n\"They worshiped him and returned to Jerusalem with great joy.\" (Luke 24:52)\\n\\n\"He said, \"Lord, I do believe,\" and worshiped him.\" (John 9:38)\\n\\nFurther, the god of Muhammad is not the Father of Jesus. The Qur'an states rather clearly, \"Proclaim: Allah is One. Allah is Eternal. He neither begets nor was begotten.\" (Surah 112:1-4)\\n\\nIn Christianity, we believe that Jesus was begotten. (John 1:14) And we believe Jesus to be God.\\n\\nNow, we have a conundrum. Either Islam is right, and Jesus is not God, nor begotten; or Christianity is right, and Jesus is God, and is begotten. We can't have it both ways. Islam will never hold to a belief that Jesus is God. And Christians will not accept that Jesus is not God, and is not begotten. Therefore, they do not worship the same God.\\n\\nOther \"gods\" fall short as well.  There is no other true god than the One of the Holy Bible found in the Old and New Testaments.\n\nAnswer:",

The lesions may go away by themselves in a few months. Some may take years.\\n\\nHowever, if there are many areas, or ones that are cosmetically undesirable, there are several options. Your dermatologist may prescribe a steroid cream to apply, or inject steroids directly into the spot to help it disappear faster. Steroids can thin the skin and should be used according to your dermatologist\u2019s directions.\\n\\nPUVA is a special kind of ultraviolet light therapy. It is sometimes used for people with widespread disease under the close supervision of a dermatologist. The major side effect of PUVA is sunburn-type reactions.

But say you have a planet in a circular orbit.  Give it a little extra speed in the direction it's going.  Now it has too much centrifugal force, and it begins to gain distance from the star -- but that means it's gaining potential energy and so must be losing kinetic energy.  So it slows down.  The detailed math shows that by the time it's gone 180 degrees around it has lost so much speed that, even though it is farther from the star, now it doesn't have enough centrifugal force to counteract gravity, so it begins to speed up.  Again, if you do the math, you see that it will return to the exact position it was at when you gave it the extra push, and with the exact same velocity it had just after that push.  So it will just keep repeating that orbit, which is highest (and slowest) at one point and lowest (and fastest) 180 degrees around; in other words, an elliptical orbit.\n\nAnswer:",

Do you know of any that have good journalism programs? If you could actually support your answers with reasons, that would be great, although obviously not necessary.\nAnswer: Well, I don't profess to know a lot about universities, but I'd say that Washington State University is a pretty good college for journalism, if not the best.  I guess it depends on where you live and how much you are willing to pay for college.  Edward R. Murrow got his degree at WSU, and they named the School of Communication after him.  On the website it says their school of communication (which includes journalism) is ranked 12th in the nation.  Which isn't the best, but it's pretty good.

But i was wondering if there are other side effects also, i know that alot of the time (all through the month) i go through alot of emotional ups and downs and i get tired and fatigued easily.  Im in the process of changing doctors because i feel like my doc. is ignoring me since he did the surgery.  But i know that sometimes my cramps are still really bad and nothing helps (otc wise).  But it's like he don't care or something and just gives me the same meds as someone without endo.  Is that o.k.?  I don't want to sound like i \"need\" something stronger, but sometimes i really do.\nAnswer: Find a new doctor.  Endometriosis is something that a lot of doctors just are not able to treat effectively.  \\n\\nI used to have periods that were so bad that I would basically pass out.  If you have pain then your doctor should work with you to manage it.  Telling you to take Midol is not acceptable.\\n\\nI'm not sure if there is a proven connection between endo and fatigue but I'll bet there is.  I've had this pretty much since I started my periods at 11 but it got really bad at 16.  I was diagnosed at 26 and I'm 30 now.  For most of my adult life I feel like I'm 80 and not 30!  I was always tired and slept a lot while my friends were going out and staying up all night.  Can't tell you for sure but that's my experience.\\n\\nRight after my surgery I was put on Lupron.  I only made it 3 months instead of the usual 6 because of the bad side effects.  This is something that I wouldn't recommend as a first choice.  After that I went on BCP.  After experimenting with a few I got on Yasmin which worked for me.  I still have pain every day but it is nothing like it was.  I used to be in constant pain and now I notice it a couple of times a day.  If it gets bad ibuprofen usually helps to keep it down.  \\n\\nEndo is weird because the amount of scarring and implants isn't necessarily related to the amount of pain.  My left ovary is completely covered (can't really see the ovary) and my right only has a couple of little implants.  I feel most of my pain on the right side.  My doctor said that he has seen women with a gut full of scarring who had no symptoms at all.  Also, what one doctor describes as bad another describes as moderate.  Just be aware of this when dealing with doctors.\\n\\nPain is felt differently by different people so it is hard to say what you need.  Find a doctor that is willing to work with you and who isn't quick to say it's in your head.  Don't be afraid to interview doctors and ask lots of questions.  If you aren't comfortable with the answers move on.  Remember that you are hiring them for a service.  Be in control - this is your body.\n\nAnswer:",

This is one of the most common forms of anxiety disorders (more common than Agoraphobia). Over 7% of the population suffers from social anxiety disorder.\\n\\nIf you have social phobia you usually worry that others will notice your anxiety because of your blushing, sweating, shaking, or difficulty getting your words out, (for example).\\n\\nOther fears triggered by social situations include:\\n\\n    * I'll look uncomfortable or awkward\\n    * I'll seem weird or strange\\n    * I'll appear stupid or incompetent\\n    * I'll look embarrassed\\n    * I'll be boring\\n\\nThese fears tend to be triggered when just anticipating the social situation. You may also have noticed that, after the event, you often feel bad or worse when thinking about how you \"performed\". How you actually felt in the situation can play a big role in this \"post-mortem\". \\n\\nThe Social Phobia/Social Anxiety Association, a non-profit organization, seeks to educate about social phobia:\\nhttp://www.socialphobia.org/\\n\\nThey list some good self help books here:\\nhttp://www.socialanxietyinstitute.org/bookstore.html\\n\\nYou should talk with your doctor and ask for a referral to a psychologist who specailizes in Anxiety Disorders.\n\nAnswer:",

COULD YOU EXPLAIN THIS PROCESS FULLY?\nAnswer: The warm front is moving into colder air. The moisture at the leading edge of the front freezes when it hits the cold air causing snow. As the front moves through, the warm air is increasingly higher in altitude which causes the falling moisture to warm up in the form of sleet then freezing rain then rain.\\n\\nHope this helps!\n\nAnswer:",

That is, you can add the gradient of any scalar field to the answer below and get an equally valid expression for the vector potential.\\n\\nIf B is the constant (vector) value of the magnetic field then the vector potential is:\\n\\nA(r) = -r x (B/2)\\n\\nwhere r is the the position vector and x means cross product. In Cartesian coordinates in which the magnetic field is pointing in the direction of the z axis, the three components of A are:\\n\\nA_x = -(B/2)y\\nA_y = (B/2)x\\nA_z = 0\\n\\nwhere B here is a constant number.\n\nAnswer:",

The basic equation for entropy that arose out of the study of thermodynamics is\\n\\nDEL S = DEL Qr /T\\n\\nwhere DEL S is the change in entropy of the system, and DEL Qr is the heat transferred to or from the system in a reversible process.  This actually is one definition of entropy.\\n\\nAnother definition of entropy, which is actually equivalent to the above, is that which arose out of statistical mechanics.  \\n\\nS = Kb ln(W)\\n\\nwhere Kb is Boltzman's constant, ln is the natural logarithm, and W is the probability that the system has a particular configuration.\n\nAnswer:",

This is an estimate, of course, as there is no way to track polygamists for sure.  The marriage ceremonies aren't legal so they are done in privacy and the families usually live separately from one another, so there's no way to know for sure who's a polygamist and who isn't.  A majority of polygamists live in Utah, but they can also be found throughout the country.  There are also \"polygamist cities\" such as Colorado City in Arizona and Bonners Ferry in Idaho where the majority of the population pracitices polygamy.\n\nAnswer:",

In fact, when CO2 levels were over ten times higher than they are now, about 450 million years ago, the planet was in the depths of the absolute coldest period in the last half billion years.\" Patterson asked the committee, \"On the basis of this evidence, how could anyone still believe that the recent relatively small increase in CO2 levels would be the major cause of the past century's modest warming?\" \\n\\n\"The man is an embarrassment to US science and its many fine practitioners, a lot of whom know (but feel unable to state publicly) that his propaganda crusade is mostly based on junk science.\"\nAnswer: He's not, Professor Patterson is the exception to most of the scientific community with regard to global warming.

(Of course, add on fringe benefits like insurance, and your retirement plan, which will let you retire nicely with 25 or 30 years, or at age 62 or 65.)  \\n\\nTeacher salary can vary greatly, depending on location, degree earned, and years of experience.  School districts that pay the most often have the highest costs of living (housing cost, etc.)  In Florida, beginning teacher salary (bachelor's degree, no experience) is $27,000 - 30,000.  Some districts pay more; others less.  Fortunately now, salary schedules are usually available at school district web-sites.  Decide where you want to live, and do a Yahoo search for the local school district web-site.  You will probably be able to find a salary schedule online.  If not, just call the school district personnel office, and they will be happy to tell you.\n\nAnswer:",

My best time now is 5;19?\nAnswer: Well as you may know, you have to train probly 5-6 times a week. Cutting 19 seconds off your time is going to take some time and patience. You should do a few runs of 4-5 miles, a long run of about 6-7 miles, and a few track workouts each week. Examples of track workouts could be 8-10 400m runs, 15 200m runs, or possibly 6 or 7 800m runs. If you do 400m, try to do them at about 75 seconds each, 2-3 minute rest. 200m should probly be around 30-33 seconds and 800m around 2:20-2:25. Change your track workout each week, like do 400's one week and maybe 800's the next. Hope that helped!!\n\nAnswer:",

Ok I'll try to explain a little on both.\\n\\nDIFFERENCE:\\n\\nThe Richter scale defines an earthquake's \"magnitude\". It is a measure of how strong an earthquake is - depending on the energy released at its source, called the focus, where the initial break or slippage in the rocks occurs. Hence this is a scientific and objective measure, calculated from amplitudes of seismic waves.\\n\\nThe Mercalli scale describes the \"intensity\". It is based on an earthquake's effect on people, structures, etc. It measures the damage on society - in other words, how intense it was for a particular area. This means it is not concerned about the earthquake source, simply on the area that is being described, and is therefore a subjective measure.\\n\\nDISADVANTAGES:\\n\\nWell, there aren't REAL disadvantages in using either scale, in fact, both should be used in order to evaluate a certain earthquake. The disadvantages lie in using only one of these, or not knowing which is which! But if you're reading the news, they're easy to distinguish: Richter is in Hindu-Arabic numerals (normal numbers) so you get 7 or 8.5, etc. Mercalli is denoted in Roman numerals, like VII, and no decimals of course.\\n\\nJust bear in mind that the Richter Magnitude is about the earthquake source itself, and the Mercalli Intensity depending on the area being considered. For example, a very strong earthquake in the middle of an uninhabited wasteland would register high on the Richter but low on the Mercalli, simply because there were no people or structures to affect. If a weak earthquake occured right in an area with many people having unstable houses, then this would cause a lot of damage or death and therefore register high on the Mercalli, although low on the Richter.\\n\\nHope this helps :)\n\nAnswer:",

I don't want to get stuck in a 6-month rental contract over this crap.\nAnswer: The VA does not normally make direct loans.  The loan is made by a bank or mortgage company.  They use their standard underwriting rules when qualifying you for the loan.  The VA only guarantees part of the loan.  This guarantee is usually sufficient to avoid having to provide a down payment.\\n\\nWhen I retired from the AF, I had a job offer in a different area 2 months before my last duty day.  It just takes work to do that, but it's entirely do-able.  I was able to get a mortgage based on my employment history and the new job committment.\\n\\nMost lenders like to see a stable employment history, typically 2 or more years in the same industry and 6 months in your current job.  You alread meet that test.  Many lenders specialize in working with military personnel.  Ideally, look for a credit union with military ties in your new location.  If they are satisfied that you are likely to find a position that provides sufficient income to pay the mortgage they may will take a chance on you.  At the very least, they will probably give you a conditional approval based on finding a job with adequate income.  You'll probably need to actually get the job before they'll fund a mortgage but at least the scut work will be done.\\n\\nIf you can't fnd a lender in advance and don't have a job prior to your ETS you'll have to rent at least temporarily.  Ask for a month-to-month contract as you're trying to buy a home.  Or ask for a clause in your lease that allows you to break the lease to move into a purchased home.  That's not unusual.  Not all landlords will do it but it doesn't hurt to ask.  I did that twice in my military career and one time the landlord agreed to add the clause AFTER I'd signed the lease.\\n\\nUnless you ask for what you want, the answer will automatically be \"No!\"  And if the first lender or landlord says, \"No!\" then look for another one.  Someone out there IS willing to work with you on this, you just need to ask around.\n\nAnswer:",

I am a little apprehensive about asking him too many questions about his religion because I don't want to get wrapped up in a religious discussion with him without knowing a little more about his beliefs.  Also, I'm interested in knowing more about their beliefs and customs so that I don't accidentally do or say anything offensive when I am in his home.  Can anyone give me a quick rundown on what I might need to know about the Mormons in order better understand the background of my girlfriend's family?  By the way....although she was raised in this family, my girlfriend is not a practicing Mormon.  I know very little about Mormons and simply wish to gain a little knowledge in order to practice good \"etiquett\" when interacting with her father.  Thanks for any info you guys can help me with.\nAnswer: Overall, they are nice people, and more respectful and respectable than the evangelical christians I know.  I would not recommend getting into a dating relationship with one of them, though.  They have been told that they need to be with a mormon.  Some of them say that they do not mind being with a nonmormon, but as the relationship gets more serious, they tend to freak out.  Eventually it comes down to the talk where the mormon says \"it doesn't feel right\".  This means they were just playin' and now they are afraid they are going to have to reap the consequences (give up the possibility of getting married in the temple).  I live in Utah, and I shiver in dread everytime one of my non-LDS friends says they are dating a member of the church.  And it always ends the exact same way.  It's like there is a script on how to date non-mormons, and people who are not mormons are not as valuable in Heavenly Father's eyes or something.\\n\\nBest of luck to you.  I sincerely hope for your sake that she really does not believe in her church.  Even if she is inactive but still believes, you are headed for heartbreak.\\n\\nOh, and if you want to learn about the religion from someone that believes, look at www.lds.org  This is a website that is put out by the LDS church.  It is pretty informative.\n\nAnswer:",

Are some methods more efficient or faster in producing visible results than others?\nAnswer: The more expensive the product, the better it is going to be.  So, starting with the cheapest, is brushing twice a day and flossing.  The cleaner your teeth are, the whiter they are going to be.  Stay away from coffee, tea, and red wine.  Then there's whitening toothpastes, floss, and rinses.  These will give results, but not as much as whitening stips or gels.  I know a lot of people who have been satisfied with Crest Whitening Strips.  Just be careful using whitening products, because they can cause sensitivity.  So, if you already have sensitive teeth, be aware.  Many electric toothbrushes claim to make teeth whiter.  I use the Sonicare brush, and I can tell a difference.  But it's not a dramatic difference.  I notice it, but I don't know if others do.  I know the Crest Spin Brush has one with brusheads that claim to whiten teeth.  If you're looking for a real big difference in shades, then you may want to try the strips.  It seems to be the biggest improvement for the cheapest.\n\nAnswer:",

But the scar is worse because the edges of the wound are ragged, and these cuts tend to get infected more easily.\\n\\nIf I cut with a sharp blade, it doesn't hurt as much, so I cut deeper, but the scars are better because the wound edges are \"clean\" and not ragged.\\n\\nIs it better to keep the cuts shallow but get bad scars, or to cut deeper but minimise the scarring?\\n\\nAnd please, don't just tell me not to do it. I know it's a bad coping mechanism, and I AM getting help with it already. I just wondered what people thought would be best, shallow wounds with bad scars or deep wounds with minimal scars.\nAnswer: I can't relate to this one,as I don't understand it,but I will say that it is a psychological coping mechanism that is a 'learned response'. \\n\\nSince it is a learned response it can also be reversed with the help of your psychiatrist. Call her as soon as you are able to. It sounds to me like things are getting worse for you instead of better.\\n\\nPlease take care and hang in there until you see her ok?\n\nAnswer:",

In swimming I had trouble with Butterfly for a long time because my arms are so much weaker than my legs.  There is a special kind of weight lifting you can do that will REALLY help your butterfly (as well as stroke power in general) and it's called a VASA bench. Butterfly was never my stroke and it was killing my IM (im a backstroker...fyi) They work miracles...the season I started doing it (Junior year of high school) I went from a 1:04 to a 57 in my 100 fly.  YOu can probably find a VASA bench at a high school with a swim team, or maybe a fitness center.  you can also buy them too, they cost around 1000 dollars.\n\nAnswer:",

I am doing research on this and have read that it could cause splenic infarction. I do not understand what this is. Does anyone know?\nAnswer: Splenic infarction is blockage of the spleen by the damaged blood cells.  The sickle cells, which are still produced with sickle cell trait, are sequestered and degraded by the spleen.  Unfortunately around half of the red blood cells in your son's body prodcued are sickle cells so the spleen is being over worked trying to take all of these cells out of the bloodstream, which will possibly cause and infarction.  Infarction is the fancy medical term for blockage of a vessel.  You have probably heard of a heart attack, which is just a myocardial infartion(a blockage of a heart vessel).  So splenic infarction would be a blockage of a splenic vessel, the problem is that it can cause necrosis(tissue death) in the spleen, lead to splenomegaly(enlarging of the spleen) and may have to be treated by removing the spleen.  I hope this helps a little.\n\nAnswer:",

What should I do? please help me :(\nQuestion: I've been dating this guy for more than 2 years. I really love him so much. Anyway, we did broke up couple months ago for about 1 month but then we decided to get back together. The last couple of days I feel that he doesn't care about me. I have to call him or email him first to know how is he doing. (note: at this time he lives in a different city from me) I waited for a while but he did not call me so I called him at night and asked him why he never call me. I told him that I've been waiting for his news. After I said that to him, he said that I dont deserve this. He said he doesn't want to continue this relationship. Also he said that he loves me but he's not in love with me. What should I do? I really don't want to break up with him. I love him so much. I tried last time but it just hurt me so bad and I am lost. Please give me some advice. What should I do?\nAnswer: Baby girl, there is nothing for you to do but heal and move on with your life. I know that it is easy to say and so hard to do. But it sounds to me that he is exploring other options or that he wants to and he does not want to keep you holding on. I hurt for you, I have been there before. At least you two can part on good terms if you allow for that to happen, don't push and don't be so available. Maybe this is the best thing for you, this may be a blessing in disguise. I know that it hurts and you are going to cry, you are going to miss him and at times you are going to feel that you cant go on without him. But you will, you can and you have to.  Being in love is a tricky thing, you can love just about anyone but it takes someone extremely special to fall in love with and it is extremely hard to stay in love. Just know that you WILL be OK with or without him.\n\nAnswer:",

While part of that is true, the other part of it is that no other system works.\\n\\nCommunism: the idea is great.  Everybody is equal, everybody has a job, everybody has the same income, etc.  Great idea, bad policy.  It doesn't work.  It's worked in a few countries, but over long periods of time, it always fails. Why?  Because there's no incentive to do well.  There's no incentive to get a better education, or to try to move up.  While the rich may seem to control a lot, and there may seem to be so much poverty, that's the best way for the world to run.  Seriously.  The poor have to work harder to move up.  The harder they work, the more they get paid, the more they can afford, etc.\\n\\nThat's the idea, anyway.  It doesn't always work, but it's a good start.  And where do the poor get their money from?  The rich.  And where do the rich get their products form?  The poor.  And where do we get hard workers who are dedicated?  From the incentive to advance through the ranks so that the poor can become the rich.\\n\\nPersonally, I tend to blame the poor more than anything for their situation.  See, I come from a low-income family.  I'm 20, and have found a way to get into college.  I've got  a 4.0 gpa, I hold a job, I spend time in the summer volunteering with children, and I coach baseball.  I do all of that while writing bad checks to pay the electric and phone bill.  So, what do I do to get by?  I work harder, I treat others right, and I've gained respect in the community.  What has that done for my family?  Well, you'd be surprised.  Now, I get treated well by people in the community, nobody looks down on me, and people offer to help me out.  Why?  Because I've spent my time helping others.  \\n\\nBasically, if the poor spent more time helping others, doing good deeds, working hard, helping the community, instead of committing crimes (the highest crime rate is among poor people), the community would have a better view of them, and might offer more help to them.  I'm not saying they would always, but in general, I think the situation for the poor would be better.\\n\\nThere's one other explanation that I'd like to share on why the poor seem to get poorer and the rich get richer.  The reason is minimum wage.  Let me expand a bit, so you can understand:\\n\\n\\n\\n1.When you raise minimum wage, there are two things that can happen.  When the minimum wage is raised, businesses are not going to profit as much, and smaller businesses especially will have to compensate.  To compensate, they either have to raise their prices or eliminate some employees.\\n\\nA.If you raise your prices, then the minimum wage increase is wiped out for those that got a pay raise.  Since only those making less than the new minimum wage would get an increase in pay, anyone making more than that would have to pay more for the same amount.  This means that the cost of living goes up, along with inflation.  This means that there will be more people living in poverty, the rich won\u2019t be affected, and the middle-class will be even more strapped for cash.  Also note that the price increase will be felt throughout the factories making the product, the shipping companies, the storage companies, and the marketplace. The old adage \u201cthe rich get richer...\u201d comes true again.\\n\\nB.If you eliminate employees, there are fewer jobs, which means that fewer people will have an income.  This will be felt in all areas of the workforce, as previously described, again meaning that the rich get richer. . . .  Inflation is still abound and the cost of living increases.  Now, since companies have a smaller workforce that is making more money, companies can do several things.\\n\\ni.Companies can now increase the costs of products since those at the bottom end are making more mo\n\nAnswer:",

Greenish discharge is often associated with infection by Trichomonas [a microscopic, parasitic protozoan], Gonorrhea [a round bacteria \"Neisseria ghonorrheae\"], or Chlamydia [also a bacterium, \"Chlamydia trachomatis\"]. Infection with any of these organism should be promptly treated [all are readily curable by means of oral and/or injectable antibiotics]. Delay in diagnosis and treatment may result in chronic infection, Pelvic Inflammatory Disease, and scarring of your internal pelvic organs leading to infertility. Go to your gynecologist or a clinic ASAP to be examined, diagnosed and properly treated. Remember, your current partner[s] must also be treated at the same time as you to prevent reinfection.\n\nAnswer:",

Free music, free movies, free software, free games.  Limewire, Emule, Bit Torrent, Kazaa, the original Napster.  Why do so many people feel it is their right to steal the work of others?\\n\\nWhy does stealing music on-line seem ok, but stealing a CD or DVD from a store still seem bad?\\n\\nAre we all to cheap to buy something, or are we all just closet thieves, and the internet lets some of us do it in a more safe manner?\nAnswer: The real answer is that copying software and music or movies is not stealing. It is copyright infringement, which is not a criminal offense. Stealing a CD or DVD from a store is actually stealing. It is a criminal offense. Stealing a CD deprives the artist, store owner, and label of the profit that they would have gotten by selling the CD. Copying music and downloading the file only deprives them of money if the person downloading would have purchased the music otherwise, which is almost never the case.\\n\\nSo don't equate copyright infringement with stealing, because it is a much lesser offense. The music industry likes to use the terms \"stealing,\" \"piracy,\" and \"theft,\" because it uses language to subconsciously alter how people are thinking about the problem. Don't fall into that trap.\\n\\nThat said, copyright infringement *is* a civil offense that is illegal. I don't think people are closet thieves, I just think that the actual value of the products that these people are producing is far less than the cost, and people feel justified in downloading it because they feel somewhat overcharged for the music they do purchase.\n\nAnswer:",

I DON'T CARE ABOUT IT AND GOT THE CD ANYWAYS BUT, IS THIS NOW A NEW THING TO STOP PEOPLE FORM MAKING COPIES? AND IS THERE A WAY AROUND THIS SO I CAN COPY IT OR EVEN PLAY IT ON MY COMPUTER?\nAnswer: Yes there is a way around this. A wonderful program called AnyDVD. It decrypts dvd's, but it also does the same for cd's. I would recommend the whole suite of their prodcuts (anydvd, clone cd, clone dvd).

I did not get any other tickets.  I was obeying all traffic laws when I was pulled over.  I don't know why the police officer pulled me over.\nAnswer: Wow.  I continue to be amazed by some of the answers folks have here.\\n\\nI'm going to assume you're in California, since you made reference to not having a California license:\\n\\nThylawyer has a good answer - just because you don't know why you were pulled over does not mean there wasn't a perfectly legal reason to do so.  Your assertion that the police didn't have probable cause (which isn't the standard used in California) because you think you were obeying all traffic laws is bizarre...you said yourself that you don't know why they pulled you over, so how can you assume they didn't have a reason?\\n\\nAnd despite what people are saying here, police in California cannot pull you over solely to find out if you have a license.\\n\\nSo the answer your question is yes, you can get the charges dimissed if the police did not have a legal reason to stop you - but you have no business assuming they had no reason to stop you just because *you* think you were obeying all the laws (and again, police in this state do not need probable cause to stop you, they only need reasonable suspicion).\n\nAnswer:",

It is a democracy, in the fact that there is direct election of representatives.  However, these representatives are the ones that actually make the decisions, the ones that make the laws (hence the Republic).  \\n\\nA republic is a form of government that has a special \"class\" or elect that make the governmental decisions (laws, etc) that govern the nation.  In our case, the elect are the representatives and senators at the federal level, as well as your local representatives (state, local) that make the decisions.  \\n\\nBecause these members are elected, then we have a democracy as well.  However, a true democracy would require the votes of everyone on every issue (direct democracy).  It would be a little bit tough with a population of 300 million.\n\nAnswer:",

Is it necceary to wear a tie?  Or in general, what is proper cocktail attire, and how does it differ from formal?\nAnswer: Cocktail attire does not necessary mean that you should wear a tie. Nowadays, cocktail attire has become less formal than in antiquity. I would go with what I like to call modern chic.\\n\\nIf you are having cocktails at night:\\nWear a dark-colored suit (I personally will always like black) with a crisp white button down shirt, leaving the first top two buttons undone. If you have a lot of chest hair that peeks up from over your shirt collar, you may want to make sure you wear a lightweight tee shirt underneath. Do not wear a tie or a belt (unless you absolutely must). Keep it simple and elegant and effortlessly sophisticated.\\n\\nIf you are having cocktails during the day:\\nFollow the guidelines above, but switch the dark colored suit for something a little lighter like a nice tan-colored suit.\\n\\nNo matter what you wear, you will always looking dashing if you (1) make sure you hair is groomed and neat, (2) keep your eyebrows groomed and brushed, (3) have clean teeth, and (4) have clean nails.\n\nAnswer:",

I am looking for methods to reduce the swelling in order for her to get activated.\nAnswer: There are a couple ways to do this, but they won't be cure-alls; just helps.  \\n\\nIbuprofen (Advil) is an NSAID, or a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug.  As the description says, it has anti-inflammatory (anti-swelling) properties, and it will help with pain.  More than likely, any other meds you are giving her do not contain ibuprofen or aspirin, but if they do, I wouldn't use this.\\n\\nBenadryl (Diphenhydramine) has properties which stop the body from reacting to irritants; that's why they use it for rashes, poison ivy, etc.  This would help as well, although it'll probably make her tired.  Diphenhydramine is the exact same drug used in the sleep aid Sominex.  (Yeah, Benadryl and Sominex are the same drug - rip off, eh?  Buy whichever is cheaper...actually, buy the cheap-o generics if they're available -- there really is no difference whatsoever.)\\n\\nThat's about all I can think of over the counter.  Other people may have good ideas as well, and I'd trust the advice of your doctor over anything you read on here.\\n\\nI'd use coldpacks, but I'd stay away from using heat; it dilates the blood vessels and may make the pain worse.  Heat is best for muscular pain.\\n\\nP.S. - Her age matters, too.  If we're talking about an infant here, I would go ONLY by the advice of your doctor.\n\nAnswer:",

Eventually this was changed to 1 January (a date associated with the Circumcision of Christ). Some of the month names indicate their position relative to the March year beginning - September, October, November, and December are formed from root words meaning \"seven\", \"eight\", \"nine\", and \"ten\", respectively. When the first of the year was changed to January, they became the 9th, 10th, 11th, and 12th months, but kept their original names.\n\nAnswer:",

The CDC recommends the use of sexual prophylactics by anyone infected with hepatitis C or any other sexually transmissible disease, but common contact is not dangerous. While it should be kept in mind that there is no known mode of transmission for approximately 10% of cases, this should not be taken as a statement that it can be easily casually acquired. Routine precautions around blood, and avoiding the sharing of toothbrushes, razors, and other personal items should provide adequate protection.\\n\\n\\n\\nA number of agents can cause hepatitis, including infectious diseases, chemical poisons, drugs and alcohol. Hepatitis C is a contagious viral disease that leads to serious, permanent liver damage, and in many cases, death.\\n IV drug users represent the largest single risk group.  Sexual contact has been clearly identified as a means of transmitting hepatitis C.  Household contact with another household member that has hepatitis C has also been strongly implicated, and this, in combination with heterosexual exposure, is believed to be responsible for approximately 13% of all infections.  Around 2% of all cases of hepatitis C are thought to be contracted through the occupational risk (needle-stick injuries, blood spills, etc) involved with the health care profession.\\n\\nPrisoners have enormous incidence of infection - rates reported in some California prisons exceed 80%, with certain institutions reporting nearly 100% of their prisoners infected.\\n\\nSome skin piercing practices, notably tattooing, body piercing, and acupuncture, have contributed significantly to the spread of HCV, particularly in less industrialized nations. Tattooing in particular poses a serious risk. Even in the presence of good sterilization, studies have suggested that the ink used in tattooing can become contaminated and transmit the virus.\\n\\nCocaine users have an abnormally high risk of infection due to the fact that they frequently share snorting straws, which may have small amounts of blood-carrying mucous on them. \\n\\nLess obvious, specialized risk factors have been identified resulting from indirect exposures to blood - including manicures, shared toothbrushes and razors, and straight razors in barber shops.\\n\\nIn many surveys, about a third of people who are alcoholics are also infected with the HCV virus.\n\nAnswer:",

How do I get rid of it?\nQuestion: I tried to remove by going to add and remove programs,restarted computer as it instructed and it is still listed in add and remove programs. Could this be why Chrysler Golf Challenge graphics are messed up?\nAnswer: Advertismen is a type of spyware that most anti-spyware programs don't pick up. I can give you directions on how to remove it, but they involve modifying your system registry. Please be very careful when altering your registry and don't modify anything except the file included in the instructions.\\n   1. Close ALL Internet Explorer, Firefox, etc. windows.\\n   2. Click on start, then click on \"Run...\" and type:   regedit and click \"ok\"\\n   3. On the left side click \"HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\" then SOFTWARE> Microsoft> Windows NT> CurrentVersion> Windows\\n   4. On the right-hand side you should see a String called \u201cAppInit_DLLs\u201d with a value of \u201cpushow*.dll\u201d where * is a random number.\\n   5. Right-click on this String and click Delete and then exit regedit.\\n   6. Go to \"My Computer\" and open \"C:&#92;windows&#92;system32&#92;\"\\n   7. In that folder there is a file called \"pushow*.dll,\" where * is the random number you saw above. Delete all pushow*.dll files.\\n\\nThat's all you need to do to remove the program. In the future, be careful about downloading things when you're not sure what they are. If you don't already have an anti-spyware program, I suggest you download adaware: http://www.lavasoft.de/software/adaware/\n\nAnswer:",

I was my face every morning and ever night and I wear lancome and clinique makeup that is makeup fee I don't know what to do all around my chin is breaking out. Any sugjestions?\nAnswer: Hi BabyDoll\\n\\nHere are some real answers on skin conditions. Remedies at the bottom. \\n\\nCleansing the body of toxins is the key. Especially a colon cleanse! Educate yourself on detoxifying the blood.\\n\\nJudyth Reichenberg-Ullman N.D. - \"What is your skin trying to tell you? Often the skin is a metaphor for deeper issues and a way for your body to send up a red flag to warn you that all is not well underneath. When our skin is unhealthy it is usually a reflection of the internal state of our bodies, and is often a sign of poor elimination of toxins and waste products. Most of us are embarrassed by skin problems such as rashes, boils or acne, especially in places where others can see our imperfections. The skin is the body's first line of defense against the environment. It has to deal with the effects of weather, sun , cold, heat, dryness, humidity, scrapes, bumps, soaps, detergents, chemicals, perspiration and dirt of all kinds. It is a wonder that our skin stays healthy most of the time! We can help our skin deal with this onslaught by optimizing our general health and by protecting our skin from harsh environmental exposure. Western medicine generally treats skin eruptions with either antibiotics, cortisone, or antifungal preparations. These medicines may alleviate the skin problem temporarily, or occasionally for good, but do not address the source of the problem. Putting a lid on skin symptoms without getting to the root of the imbalance may even result in suppression, that means the imbalance may be driven deeper causing more serious health problems later without ever strengthening the underlying vital force of the person. Fortunately, naturopathic medicine offers a wide vareity of effective treatments for skin problems.\"\\n\\nJudyth Reichenberg-Ullman N.D. - \"Your skin is a reflection of how well your body is eliminating the toxins that build up on a daily basis. Chronic skin conditions such as acne, eczema and psoriasis stem from a combination of genetic factors, immune stress, dietary deficiencies or sensitivities, and the accumulation of toxins in the body. For our skin to be radiant and clear, it is very important that the other organs of elimination (kidneys, liver, lungs, and colon) are cleansing the body effectively. If not, the skin will be overtaxed, pores will become clogged, and eruptions of one sort or another will result. Here are a number of steps you can take to improve your body's overall elimination wtih specific emphasis on your skin.\" \\n\\nDetoxification is a normal body process of eliminating or neutralizing toxins through the colon, liver, kidneys, lungs, lymph and skin. Fasting is the world's most ancient and natural healing mechanism. Fasting triggers a truly wondrous cleansing process that reaches right down to each and every cell and tissue in the body. \\n\\nLearn more about Therapeutic Fasting and Detoxification - Internal Cleansing \\n\\nNatural Cures\\n\\n1. Fruits and Vegetables for Acne: Carrot & spinach, celery & watercress, grapefruit juices are all useful to combat acne. \\n\\n2. Unwholesome Foods: Acne, a prevalent problem among teen-aged boys would not be possible in our society if our foods were wholesome. A most sad and disgusting sight is the pus-filled pimples due to inner toxicity --- wastes trying desperately to escape through the face. This condition often turns a gentle face in the blossom of youth into a waste dump of pimples, pus and subsequent pock marks which can be prevented. The tons of acne medications and prescriptions sold annually act only on the effect of the harmful food, and not the cause of the disease, malnutrition. The traditional teenage meal, a grease burger, french fries and a milk shake or cola simply does not provide enough nourishment for anyone, let alone a boy going through puberty to adulthood. Our highly processed foods are devoid of hormones found in fresh fruits, vegetables, grains, nuts and seeds. **Must do a colon cleanse to \n\nAnswer:",

I am not trying to be rude or anything, my best friend is mormon and I love and care about her and her family.  I was just wondering about this.  What do you think?  Thanks!\nAnswer: Honestly, thats the funniest thing i've ever heard of in my life.  I've been a mormon my entire life, and we have no \"secret passwords\" or \"handshakes\". I would know, i've been to the temple many times.  Granted, if i wasn't mormon, and I heard about some of the things we do, i would be confused.  The main things that go on in the temple are;\\n\\n1- Marriages and sealings. we believe that when a man and woman go through the temple to get married, they are sealed together for time and all eternity.  This is a big deal for us.  Thats why it's done in the sacred temple.  They do hold hands over an alter, but it's just like a couple holding hands while they are saying their vows.\\n\\n2- Baptisms for the dead.  This is actually really fun.  Me and my friends go about once a week. and it's not satanic, they did it in the bible.  we just are baptized in someone elses name, someone who didn't have the chance to recieve the gospel while they were on earth. This is also a big deal to us. it allows us to be together with out entire family forever.  \\n\\nI hope this helped, honestly we're not that weird, and our temples are absolutelly gorgeous. Maybe you should talk to your best friend, and see what she was to say.\n\nAnswer:",

But it is not because the sound waves are being affected by gravity.  It is because the medium that the sound travels through is affected by gravity.  The air is thicker at the 1st floor and thinner at the 10th floor.  To make an extreme example it would be like passing sound through water at the 1st floor and air at the 10th.  So yes it will be different sounds but because of the effect of gravity on the medium not the waves.\n\nAnswer:",

I've been looking for others that I can substitute for American (other than Cheddar). What I really need is a complete listing of what is lactose free.\nAnswer: Hard aged cheeses are generally much lower in lactose, but they aren't lactose free. They might just have a low enough amount that it won't upset your body. Aged sharp cheddar, aged swiss (gruyere, emmentaler), or dry jack might be good options. Another thing you might want to try are raw cheeses (available at many health food stores). A majority of people who are lactose intolerant are not bothered by raw dairy products. It has something to do with the pasteurization process changing the structure of the lactose. They're generally a little more expensive, but it might be worth a try if it means you'd be able to eat cheese.\n\nAnswer:",

These are how the current crop of Web superstars are running their businesses such as MySpace, Craigslist, etc. You may be able to get ideas from it and adopt it to what you want to do on the Web.\\n\\nThe Web offers tremendous opportunities for those who know how to harness it. You hear of stories of people who earn thousands if not millions of dollars from doing business on Web. While there are many scams (same way in the traditional business world), there are various ways you can legitimately make money on the Web.\\n\\nHere are the main business models you can adopt:\\n\\n1. Sell products on the Web - Big boys like Amazon or Lillian Vernon online catalog or smaller businesses like BigKidsVideo.com or Candle4Less.com all sell products on the Web. \\n\\nYou can either sell: (a) through your own storefront through your own website or applications such as Yahoo Stores; or (b) sell through online auctions like eBay\\n\\n2. Information Delivery. Others such as About.com or EuropeforVisitors.com create content and monetize their content in a number of ways:\\n\\na. Advertising - From the article \"How to Generate Advertising Revenues for Your Web Site\" http://www.powerhomebiz.com/vol28/adrevenues.htm , there are several ways you can earn money from advertising:\\n\\n1. Join an advertising network. Advertising networks are organizations that aggregate Web sites that offer advertising space, and sell banner ads (and other advertising options) across them. Traffic requirement is often a minimum of 5,000 monthly impressions, although many do not accept sites hosted by free page services. \\n\\nBurst Media http://www.burstmedia.com\\nFastclick (ValueClick). http://www.fastclick.com\\nAdvertising.com. http://www.advertising.com\\nTribal Fusion http://www.tribalfusion.com \\n\\n2. Participate in contextual advertising networks. Contextual advertising are text ads delivered based on the content of the web page using an automated system. \\n\\nGoogle Adsense https://www.google.com/adsense/\\nYahoo! Publishing Network (currently in beta and available to US publishers only) http://publisher.yahoo.com/ \\nIntellixt http://vibrantmedia.com/site/web_01a5.htm \\nQuigo Adsonar http://www.quigo.com/adsonarexchange.htm \\nIndustryBrains http://www.industrybrains.com \\nCommission Junction Evolution http://www.cj.com\\n\\n3.

Preferably, that means about 7 a.m. or earlier. You might not feel like it but Get Up. Such regularity helps your body function more normally so you're more likely to feel normal. \\n\\nLIGHTS: \\n\\nLight helps your body function better. So turn on a lot of lights as soon as you arise. Open curtains to get more sunlight. Better yet, go outdoors into the sunshine as soon as you can. Remove any eyewear so light will enter more readily (glass cuts out some of the sun's rays). But don't stare at the sun, of course. \\n\\nMOVE: \\n\\nBe active right away -- oxygenate! That means getting up and walking around your dwelling for five or 10 minutes, or perhaps riding an exercycle. Mild exercise gets the blood flowing and transports more oxygen throughout your body (especially to your brain), helping you feel mentally alert and alive. \\n\\nMUSIC: \\n\\nSelect and play some energetic, happy music as you dress and have your breakfast. The audiovisual department of most libraries has albums and tapes you can check out. \\n  \\n\\nBREAKFAST: \\n\\nBegin your breakfast with protein (i.e., meat, eggs, peanut butter, nuts, cheese). When you get up, your body chemistry is ready to convert food, especially protein,into longlasting energy. To balance your most important meal of the day, add an orange or other fresh fruit and whole grain cereal or whole grain bread. \\n\\nTALK WITH SOMEONE: \\n\\nOne of the quickest ways to beat the blues is to interact with others. You might not feel like doing that - you'd rather avoid people when blue. So make lt easier on yourself. Talk with someone you enjoy about a subject you enjoy so there is definite give and take. \\n\\nAnd, force yourself to say \"hello\" to the persons next to you in class, those where you live, anyone around. \\n\\nLIMIT CAFFEINE: \\n\\nThe long-term (four hours or so) effects of caffeine are depression. Try to limit coffee to no more than one cup in the morning. Coffee can make you more alert for an hour or so, but later you get an opposite reaction. Caffeine tends to increase the release of insulin in the blood, and insulin lowers the blood sugar level. When you have low blood sugar levels, you begin to feel less sure of yourself, and have low energy levels, which can lead to the blues or depression. \\n\\nLIMIT SUGAR: \\n\\nSugar might give you an initial rush of energy, but within an hour or so the blood sugar level can become low, and when it's low you may feel low, too. \\n\\nThe caffeine/sugar cycle. It's easy to get caught in the caffeine and sugar cycle -- having coffee, caffeinated soft drinks, or something with sugar every two hours or so to \"stay up.\" For example, cola contains about 10 teaspoons of sugar plus caffeine equal to about half a cup of coffee. In addition to bringing on the blues, this cycle can result in dependence, poor nutrition. and obesity -- reasons to get down on yourself even more and feel blue. \\n\\nMAINTAIN FIBER: \\n\\nFiber helps food go through your digestive system at a proper rate, giving a more constant energy supply. Highly processed foods merely provide a quick surge of energy which can be followed by depression. You can maintain fiber in your diet by eating an orange or grapefruit rather than just drinking the juice. Eat fresh vegetables, fresh fruits, and whole grain breads and cereals. \\n\\nSTRESS B COMPLEX: \\n\\nSome persons report receiving help by taking a concentrated vitamin B complex. You'll find these called something like \"Stress B\" or \"B 50.\" This is controversial. \\nSome nutritionists say, \"Yes, this really should be considered,\" and others say, \"No, this is not a good Idea.\" You can try some and decide whether or not it helps you. If it does help, then perhaps you should consult a nutritionist to see if there are other ways you can augment your die\n\nAnswer:",

A more holistic approach has been favored by institutions such as the United Nations Development Program, which annually measures the Human Development Index (HDI) for a wide number of nations; the HDI is composed of three variables:\\n\\n1. GDP per capita, adjusted by PPP\\n2. Life expectancy at birth\\n3. Literacy proportion\\n\\nFor more info on GDP calculations and PPP, look them up in a macroeconomics textbook: Dornbusch, Fisher and Startz or Mankiw are good options.\n\nAnswer:",

The Racial Justice Act (\"RJA\") was signed into law by Kentucky Governor Patton on May 1, 1998.  This allows a capital defendant to use statistical evidence to show that race influenced the decision to seek the death penalty in her or his case. \\nThe statistical evidence that the capital defendant may use consists of evidence that a death sentence was sought significantly more frequently against persons of one race or sought more frequently against defendants whose victims were of one race. The decision will be made in each defendant's trial court at a pretrial hearing and the defendant has the burden of proof by clear and convincing evidence.\\n\\nFYI:  This Kentucky bill was initiated after an investigation found that all of the state's death row inmates were there for killing whites and none for killing blacks. While the U.S. House of Representatives twice has passed bills similar to the RJA, they were defeated in the Senate. The passage of the RJA in Kentucky, however, is a hopeful sign that Congress and other states may follow Kentucky's example.\n\nAnswer:",

I want to get a job when I turn 14 (thats the legal working age here). My mom doesn't think I am responsible and she keeps saying stuff infront of my dad  like the only reason I want to get a job is to meat guys. Wich is not true, I am not even interested in guys right now believe it or not. I have  never had a boy friend or been crazy about a guy or anything. Why is she trying to make me look so immature infront of my dad? He is already saying that he doesn't like the idea. I really need some tips!\nAnswer: The way to solve any problem is to look at it carefully, then come up with a plan...\\n\\nSo why does Mom think you're irresponsible? Do you do things like homework, and chores, without fuss or complaint? Does she have to ask you several times to do something? \\n\\nHave you been up to anything recently that she told you not to do?\\n\\nIf your track record here isn't great, it's time to lay a better foundation -- plan on a few months of being  a model citizen to prove yourself before approaching the topic again.\\n\\nOkay, so if you've got that part - you do your homework, do your cchores promptly without whining, haven't been up to anything that got (or would get) you in trouble, then it's time to lay it out professionally.\\n\\nYou ask to meet with your parents. Before that, you write out:\\n\\n> the reasons why you want to work (\"I'd like to earn money for movies\"  \"It will look good on college applications and resumes late\" whatever your reasons are)\\n\\n> your plan for making sure the job doesn't interfere with school (\"I'd only work during school breaks\"  \"I'll only work one day a week\" whatever your plan is)\\n\\n> anything that argues that you're responsible enough to handle it \\n\\n> what you could gain from working (\"money for clothes\"  \"I'll put half of what I earn into savings for college\" \"experience working with other people\" etc.)\\n\\nThen you meet with them and give them a copy of all of this.\\n\\nUnderstand that they still might say \"no.\"  If so, ask them, calmly, why they're saying \"no.\" Discuss it with them, calmly, but don't throw a tantrum - that will just prove that you're not mature enough.\\n\\nIf they do say \"no,\" ask them to help you figure out another way to earn money.

I just need to know the basics, like... what does it eat, where is it found, etc.\\n\\nyannow... the basics\nAnswer: Coelacanths are lobe-finned fish with the pectoral and anal fins on fleshy stalks supported by bones, and the tail fin divided into three lobes, the middle one of which also includes a continuation of the notochord. Coelacanths have modified cosmoid scales, which are thinner than true cosmoid scales, which can only be found on extinct fish. Coelacanths also have a special electroreceptive device called a rosteral organ in the front of the skull, which probably helps in prey detection.\\n\\nCoelacanths first appear in the fossil record in the Middle Devonian, about 390 million years ago. Prehistoric species of coelacanth lived in many bodies of water in Late Paleozoic and Mesozoic times.\\n\\nThe average weight of the coelacanth is 176 pounds (80 kg) and they can reach up to 6.5 feet (2 m) in length. Scientists believe individual coelacanths may live as long as 60 years.\\n\\nThey are the only living species known to have a functional intracranial joint, which almost completely separates the front and back halves of the skull internally. Flexure at this joint may aid in the consumption of large prey. Coelacanths are also mucilaginous; their scales release mucus and their bodies continually exude oil. This oil is a laxative, and makes the fish almost inedible unless dried and salted. Their scales are very rough, and are used by the villagers of the Comoros as sandpaper.\\n\\nCoelacanth eyes are very sensitive, and have a tapetum lucidum. Coelacanths are almost never caught in the daytime or on nights with full moons, due to the sensitivity of their eyes.\\n\\nCoelacanths are opportunistic feeders, hunting cuttlefish, squid, snipe eels, small sharks, and other fish found in their deep reef and volcanic slope habitats. Coelacanths are also known to swim head down, backwards and belly up to locate their prey presumably utilizing its rosteral gland. Scientists suspect that one reason this fish has been so successful is that they can slow down their metabolisms at any time, sinking into the less-inhabited depths and minimizing their nutritional requirements in a sort of hibernation mode.\n\nAnswer:",

Any ideas?\nQuestion: I have tryed debt consolidation places but I need to loan to be able to do it all because they dont cover some of my debt.\nAnswer: It is possible to get a debt consolidation loan with bad credit, but not all of your debts may be eligible. \\n\\nHowever, consolidating what you can could be a good start. Combine your credit cards, etc into one manageable debt. There are companies that will provide this, even if you have bad credit. This should free more of your income to tackle your other debts.\\n\\nAnd you must do this. Don't use debt consolidation simply as an excuse to rack up even more debt: if you do, you'll end up going bankrupt.\\n\\nForce yourself to budget your expenditure within your income. This must include whatever it takes to repay your other debts. Cut up all but one of your credit cards. Leave the one remaining card at home, to be used only in emergencies. Pay for everything by cash. When you pay cash it forces you to understand the real value of money!\\n\\nThis is hard, but if you stick to it, you'll not only repay your debts, you'll repair your credit as well. \\n\\nGood luck.\n\nAnswer:",

Can you go back to using an antenna instead of cable or satellite.\\n\\nDo you and your spouse, if you have one, both need cell phones.  Do you both really talk enough (like over 200 minutes a month) to justify your monthly cell phone plan?  Prepaid plans are available for 10 cents a minute.  Check out T-Mobile.  If you pay $100 in advance, those 1000 minutes are good for 1-year, vs. $35 or so monthly bill that most people don't even use half the minutes available.\\n\\nDo you need call waiting and caller ID on your phone?  Dump'em.  If you are paying more than 3.9 cents per minute for domestic long distance, you are getting hosed.  Americom offers that with no monthly charges and no monthly minimum usage requirements.\\n\\nShop your auto insurance.  Especially check out Costco if you are a member.  Last year I shopped around for auto insurance.  Everyone gave me higher prices than what I was already paying, except Costco.  They offered me the same coverage for $500 less per year.\\n\\nDo this with every bill that comes in.  Ask yourself if you really need that service, at that level.  Is there a cheaper alternative?  Can I pare back on the service plan?\\n\\nAs for your car or truck.  Buy them lightly used with low miles, and save a ton.  Then drive it 8 to 10 years and save even more.

HCG helps to ensure that the corpus luteum of the ovary continues to produce progesterone and estrogen. At about 8 weeks of pregnancy in humans , the outer layer of cells developing placenta begins to produce progesterone. at this point the corpus luteum is no longer needed so the production of HCG, which sustained it, begins to decrease\\n\\nEstrogen: this hormone is production increases. this results in the development of the mothers mammary gland to promote lactation and stimulate uterine growth. \\n\\nProgesterone: the levels of this hormone increases during the pregnancy. this hormone is needed to maintain the endometrial lining of the uterus during the pregnancy and reduce the contractility of uterine muscle. \\n\\nHuman Placental Lactogen (HPL): produced at about 6 weeks during pregnancy and peaks at term. it helps in the promotion of growth and lactogenic property.\\n\\nsome Changes in body during pregnancy:\\nIncreased blood volume, Amenorrhea (absence of menstruation), softening of the cervix, changes in the breast, has feeling of fullness, tingling or tenderness to breast, change in physical appearance, appearance of striae and Linea nigra.\\n\\nhope this is helpful...\n\nAnswer:",

Normally these enzymes are not present in the blood, but they are released into the blood stream as cardiac (heart) cells die as a result of the heart attack.  The cell bursts when it dies and spills the enzymes into the blood stream.  So when these enzymes are present, it means there has been cardiac cell death, and therefore a heart attack.\n\nAnswer:",

The solvent keeps the glue from sticking inside the bottle.\\n\\nWhen you squirt the glue out of the bottle onto a piece of paper or a broken china cup, the solvent gradually evaporates, allowing the glue to get sticky.\\n\\nThe solvent molecules bounce and jiggle at the surface of the glue-solvent mixture and some get enough energy (when neighbors slam into them) to escape. That's evaporation. Outside of the bottle, few solvent molecules remain near the spread glue to hit it and renter the mixture. So, gradually enough solvent molecules leave the mixture that the glue gets sticky.\\n\\nIt's different in the capped bottle. The solvent molecules evaporate inside the bottle-just as they do outside the bottle when you spread the glue. However, once airborne they don't have far to go. They're trapped in the bottle. Some of the solvent molecules near the surface of the glue bop into and reenter the glue. That's condensation. Gradually--as more and more solvent molecules crowd into the airspace above the glue-solvent mixture--more and more solvent molecules reenter the mixture. Until, eventually, as many solvent molecules leave as reenter and the mixture reaches equilibrium.\\n\\nGlue manufacturers make sure the glue mixture stays runny by choosing a sufficiently small air space when they fill the bottle. You may have noticed that old glue in an almost empty bottle gets viscous or even solid. It's a good idea to buy only enough glue for use in the near future.\\n\\nAs far as sticking to the bottle is concerned, here's the poop from Elmer's glue: \"If it were to dry out or harden, it would form a very weak bond with the special nonporous plastic used to make the bottle and could be de-bonded or removed easily,\" says Robert Thompson.\n\nAnswer:",

Choose one from the option.\nOption: Society & Culture, Science & Mathematics, Health, Education & Reference, Computers & Internet, Sports, Business & Finance, Entertainment & Music, Family & Relationships, Politics & Government \nQuestion: Do you know who was the only woman emperor in ancient China?\nAnswer: Empress Wu Zetian  \\n\\nEven though according to the Confucian beliefs having a woman rule would be as unnatural as having a \"hen crow like a rooster at daybreak,\" during the most glorious years of the Tang dynasty a woman did rule, and ruled successfully. She was Wu Zetian, the only female in Chinese history to rule as emperor. To some she was an autocrat, ruthless in her desire to gain and keep power. To others she, as a woman doing a \"man's job,\" merely did what she had to do, and acted no differently than most male emperors of her day. They also note that she managed to effectively rule China during one of its more peaceful and culturally diverse periods.\\n\\nThe Tang dynasty (618-906 AD) was a time of relative freedom for women. They did not bind their feet nor lead submissive lives. It was a time in which a number of exceptional women contributed in the areas of culture and politics. So it is no surprise that Wu, born into a rich and noble family, was taught to play music, write, and read the Chinese classics. By thirteen years of age she was known for her wit, intelligence, and beauty, and was recruited to the court of Emperor Tai Tsung. She soon became his favorite concubine. But she also had eyes for his son, Kao Tsung.\\n\\nWhen the emperor died and Kao Tsung took over, Wu was now twenty seven years old. In time she became a favorite concubine of the new emperor, giving birth to the sons he wanted. As mother of the future emperor of China, she grew in power. She managed to eliminate Kao Tsung's wife, Empress Wang, by accusing her of killing Wu's newborn daughter. Kao Tsung believed Wu, and replaced Empress Wang to marry the up and coming Wu Zetian. Within five years of their marriage, Emperor Kao Tsung suffered a crippling stroke. The Empress Wu took over the administrative duties of the court, a position equal to the emperor. She created a secret police force to spy on her opposition, and cruelly jailed or killed anyone who stood in her way, including the unfortunate Empress Wang. With the death of Emperor Kao Tsung, Wu managed to outflank her eldest sons and moved her youngest, and much weaker son, into power. She in effect ruled, telling him what to do.\\n\\nIn order to challenge Confucian beliefs against rule by women, Wu began a campaign to elevate the position of women. She had scholars write biographies of famous women, and raised the position of her mother's clan by giving her relatives high political posts. She moved her court away from the seat of traditional male power and tried to establish a new dynasty. She said that the ideal ruler was one who ruled like a mother does over her children.\\n\\nIn 690, Wu's youngest son removed himself from office, and Wu Zetian was declared emperor of China. In spite of her ruthless climb to power, her rule proved to be benign. She found the best people she could to run the government, and treated those she trusted fairly. She reduced the army's size and stopped the influence of aristocratic military men on government by replacing them with scholars. Everyone had to compete for government positions by taking exams, thus setting the practice of government run by scholars. Wu also was fair to peasants, lowering oppressive taxes, raising agricultural production, and strengthening public works.\\n\\nDuring her reign, Empress Wu placed Buddhism over Daoism as the favored state religion. She invited the most gifted scholars to China and built Buddhist temples and cave sculptures. Chinese Buddhism achieved its highest development under the reign of Wu Zetian.\\n\\nAs she grew older, Empress Wu lessened the power of her secret police. But she become increasingly superstitious and fearful. Sorcerers and corrupt court favorites flattered her. Finally, in 705, she was pressured to give up the throne in favor of her third son, who was waiting all these years in the wings. Wu Zetian died peacefully at age eighty the same year.\n\nAnswer:",

If you're attracting a girl that things its \"cool\" or \"sexy\" that you're a \"bad boy\" then you're probably just attracting the wrong type of girl. Long term, wouldn't you rather have someone that really cares about you and enjoys you for just being you?  Wouldn't you rather be with someone who you don't have to entertain to keep them around?  Trust me, you'll be much happier with a gal who wants to laugh at your silly jokes and smiles at you when you're being really genuine.  Be yourself, and don't risk a criminal record just to get a girl to like you.  She probably won't stick around in the long run anyway, and look at what you might have lost if you had spent all that time trying to impress some girl.  \\n\\nOn the other hand, if she's a quality girl and you really do like her, then take your chances by confessing to her that you've got a crush, and you keep trying to impress her with your trouble-making, but that your real hope is that she's crushing on you too.  You might just find that she's attracted to you and NOT the trouble your causing.  Maybe she's trying to show you, \"hey, I like you. Even if you're causing trouble.\"  Talk to her, ask her, and don't be scared.  Girls like guys that are honest, and if you are able to communicate your interest in her, she'll most likely be really impressed!  Good luck and keep us updated!  Oh, and stay out of trouble.

They also share all the other characteristics of birds, being warm-blooded (around 40 deg C) and having a reduced reproductive system (one functional ovary or testis).\\nLike all other birds, penguins have feathers. Penguin feathers are short, overlapping and densely packed. The outer part of the feather is waterproof while the inner down section traps an insulating layer of air, keeping the penguin warm in the sometimes freezing water. Unlike those of flying birds, the feathers on a penguin wing are very short.\n\nAnswer:",

I downloaded the free software from the MBA.com website.  They have two full practice tests and I found these helpful.\\n\\n2.  I also bought a Kaplan book and a Princeton Review book.  I thought that the Kaplan book was much more helpful.  One *big* helpful hint that I found was to **NOT** write in the book - you can't write on the computer screen on the test, so don't get into bad habits.\\n\\n3.  ETS also offers \"The Official Guide for GMAT Review.\"  I didn't use it, but I heard that it is very helpful - the questions in the book come from old tests.\\n\\n4.  In general, spend a little time each day working on the test.  If English is your native language, I wouldn't spend that much time worrying about the essays.  I don't think those scores are really looked at unless English is a second language for you.\\n\\n5.  Try not to stress to much and keep one eye on the clock.  Good luck!\n\nAnswer:",

If it doesn't state anything about him being about to raise your rent during the lease/contract period then he shouldn't be able too.  However, at the end of the lease/contract he could raise the rent as he saw fit and it would be up to you to accept or decline.  If you are not under a lease/contract, then he may be able to raise the rent to any amount at any time.\n\nAnswer:",

If you ask them how they liked their assignment they'll tell you it was terrible because \"There's nothing to do.\" But if you put in nothing, you get nothing -- it's that simple. Now, if you're willing to get out -- there's tons of things to do.\\n\\nSpangdahlem is almost right on the border with Belgium. There are all sorts of places you can go for a day trip. You can go to Brussels, Amsterdam, Paris. All of these are a few hours away.\\nThe city of Trier, nearby Spang, is the oldest city in Germany, and has old Roman ruins, and great shopping. \\n\\nEvery base offers language courses to help you integrate. If you're willing to extend the effort, you can learn the language, and do even more. Also, Both Ramstein and Spang offer university courses with the University of Maryland where you can get your education through a Master's Degree.\\n\\nYou can go skiing in the Alps, and visit King Ludwig's castles (AWESOME). You can take tours offered by the base and visit anyplace in europe you want to go: Italy? England? Spain? You name it, there are tours.\\n\\nAlso, there's a company called \"Ryanair\" that flies out of a nearby commercial airport that offers super-cheap airfares (say -- twenty dollars -- round trip) to London, and to many other locales in Europe. Take advantage of it.\\n\\nBoth Ramstein and Spang have very active Officers' and Enlisted Spouce's organizations. If you want to be involved with base activities and meet new friends, you'll have all the opportunities you want.\\n\\nYou can travel, you can sightsee, you can shop, you can take classes, you can be involved with the community. You can be as involved and active as you wish. That's what I mean when I say, that what you get out of the experience is exactly what you put into it.\\n\\nAny questions??\\n\\n==============================================\\n\\nSpangdahlem is in the Eifel Region of Germany. It's a very little town and a very big base. The closest towns nearby are Bitburg and Trier (the oldest city in Germany). Spang has a fairly high ops tempo, and it's a busy place to be. If you can make your question more specific, I'd be happy to give more details.\n\nAnswer:",

And it has become really hard to get my teeth clean. Why is this?\nAnswer: Most likely, you are developing gingivitis. It often can be reversed by adopting good dental hygiene habits, which include regular brushing and flossing, as well as twice-yearly dental visits for thorough teeth examinations and cleaning. Once you begin treatment, you will need to continue to see your dentist regularly in order to reverse gum disease. Also, incorporate an anti-gingivitis mouth wash, if you haven't already.\n\nAnswer:",

Because we are on a tight budget, we are planning to go out to dinner after our wedding and small \"cake and punch\" reception.  We want everyone to know that they are welcome to join us - but on seperate tabs.  How can we go about making it known to everyone that we'd love the company, but dinner is \"Dutch Treat?\"  It seems most people don't know what \"going Dutch\" means anymore, and we want to be clear, but not tacky or rude.  I can't find anything about it on any of the \"Etiquette\" websites.\nAnswer: Etiquette wise, your wedding requires no treat.  If your wedding is at 3 in the afternoon, that would make your reception start at about 3:30 or 4:00.  This is not a time that people usually eat dinner, so a cake and punch reception would suffice.  No one should be expecting a full meal at 4:00.  If you guys party and mingle until about 6:00, then that's just in time for everyone to get home before dinner time.\n\nAnswer:",

And isn't two women lying together the same supposed \"sin\" as two men lying togeher? I think the church is wrong! This passage has been misunderstood! What do you all think?

I am and how I am raising my son wrong...\\n\\nI just would liek to understand.\nAnswer: I am not liberal or a conservative, but I do think that it is wrong to teach children that there is a difference in peoples sexual preferences.  Children at that age should not know anything about what adults do.  I know it is hard to keep them from hearing everything, but there is no reason to put it right in front of them.  The schools should teach acceptance of all people despite race, gender, etc.  I think that in this day and age it is hard for us to protect our children from all the harsh realities of life.  Your son will be exposed to this at some point in the future but it is up to you to teach him what you want him to know.  And, you have to be ready for your child to make his own decision on how he feels when he is older.  His best friend may end up being gay or something you don't like.  I think that you have every right to raise your son how you want to, but you need to be ready for him to rebel in some way, or to just not have the same convictions as you.  I know that my parents are proud of me even though I don't have the same beliefs as they do.  My parents never tried to force their beliefs on me, but they did try to influence my decision by telling me what they thought was right.  \\n \\nDon't try to understand the agends of the political world.  The basic thing is to make the other guy look bad so you will always look good.  It is all a bunch of crap anyway.  Go with your feelings and forget the rest of the junk.\\n\\n\\nI would also like to ask a question:  Why does being gay have to be an issue?  Is a gay person not still a person just because he is gay?  Why do we have to fight over gay rights?  I thought that as a person we already had all the rights we needed to be allowed to live.  \" the right to life, liberty, and the persute of happiness\"  How does being gay change those rights?  If being gay is what makes a person happy then they have the right to be gay without being treated differently.\n\nAnswer:",

Even Wikipedia, but always take wikipedia with a grain of salt, since it's nonprofessional and many professors don't accept citations from it.\\n\\nThe gas laws should be pretty well covered in an elementary chemistry textbook.  I really can't recall if such a book would cover Fickian diffusion, but Dalton's law and Henry's law should be in there as well.  If you have a chapter in your course textbook about blood chemistry, that might be a place to look, as Dalton's law deals with the partial pressure of gases, and Henry's law with the solubility of gases in liquids.  Fick's law would certainly be covered in any references about the lungs.\n\nAnswer:",

These are the factors you need to play around with to make sure you get top ranking in all the search engines: \\n\\nAge = the older the website, the better. There is this thing called \"sandbox\" where new websites are not shown until several months later\\n\\nContent = you need to have content related to a similar theme. The better your content and the more original your content, the more likely other websites will want to link to you and audiences will come back to your site\\n\\nKeyword density = the overall percentage of your page content that is made up of the targeted keywords. An additional factor in keyword density is the percentage of your keyword content that uses special formatting such as bold, italic, anchor text, etc.\\n\\nHow it fares in the results = the search engine knows when you have clicked on a result. They also know when you have returned to the results to try another site.\\n\\nSite structure = The way your site is structured determines how easily a search engine spider can get through it, the priority is gives specific content, and how much code the spider has to weed through to get to your content.\\n\\nBacklinks = With backlinks, as with websites in general, it's quality that counts. \\n\\nGeneral timeline of getting your site ranked well \\n\\n2 - 3 months: MSN rankings secured \\n4 - 6 months: Yahoo! rankings improving \\n6 - 8 months: Yahoo! rankings secured and Google improving.

The new security system is so sophisticated that it can photograph people\u2019s faces, intercept phone calls and deduce cell phone numbers almost anywhere in the city. \\n\\nTelevision rights, corporate sponsorships and ticket sales help the hosting country bear the burden of the costs, but $12 billion is a lot to come up with. NBC is paying about $800 million for broadcast rights to the Olympics in the U.S. NBC expects to net a record $1 billion in ad sales for its Olympic coverage. Indonesia's major networks decided a $1.35 million price tag was too much, though they are willing to dish out $10 million to air the 2006 FIFA World Cup. \\n\\nTicket sales for the 2004 Olympics have been disappointing, partly due to late construction and partly due to a lack of interest in attending the games among the Greek citizens. Just two weeks before the start of the Olympics, about 3.1 million of 5.3 million tickets remain unsold. \\n\\nWhat remains to be seen is if hosting the 2004 Olympics was worth it. Greek politicians are adamant that late ticket sales and long-term tourist dollars will pay for the costs over time, but many are skeptical. Since the Los Angeles Olympics in 1984, every hosting country has either broken even or made a profit on running the two-week event, but the costs are getting out of control. Breaking even on the Olympics this time around would be a tremendous accomplishment. \\n\\nWhat about the value of the new stadiums? Four years after the Sydney Olympics, under-used venues are costing taxpayers $32 million (in U.S. dollars) a year to keep afloat, and the government expects that some venues will need at least another decade to break even. \\n\\nIf you think the Greeks overcommitted, the Chinese have budgeted $23 billion for the 2008 Olympic games \u2013 seven times more than the Sydney games, and 32 times what Los Angeles spent for the 1984 Games!\n\nAnswer:",

I read the book and really enjoyed it. We don't get to go to the movies much due to our 2 year old. Is this one worth seeing in the theatre or should we wait for the DVD?\\n\\nThanks!\nAnswer: If you enjoyed the book, you'll like the movie.  they are very similar.  I would recommend seeing it in the theater if possible.  I think all good movies are better in the theater.  But do NOT take your baby!  \\n\\nIf you can't get out anytime soon though, you may as well save some money and wait for the DVD. \\n\\nI don't think you'll be disappointed w/the movie though.  Ian McKellan is excellent as Teabing!\\n\\nAnd just to comment on the person above me...I think it totally depends on where you live and how many showings your theater has.  For me, some showings were sold out, but I just walked up 10 min. before the movie started and was able to get tickets for my showing.  I haven't NOT been able to get tickets for a movie I wanted to see in like 2 years...since less people go to the movies these days.\n\nAnswer:",

This happens a lot to people who have an excess of Candida Albicans in the system (caused by eating too much refined sugar and white flour and not enough whole foods, fruits and vegetables), and can also happen from a buildup of bacteria locally. If you wear the same underwear for too long, or wear a wet bathing suit for longer than half a day, it can happen quite easily. Some women get minor Yeast infections every month right before their period, and the period usually resolves the infection. They're normal, you just have to make sure you see a doctor if you get them TOO regularly, because this could mean you have an auntoimmune disorder you're unaware of. Also, you want to go to a doctor the first time you think you have one so he or she can make sure it's not something else; a lot of Sexually Transmited Infections can mimic Yeast Infections, as can Vaginitis and Bacterial Infections. It's best to check with your doctor, but if you already have and are looking for a good anti-itch remedy, put some plain yogurt on the itchy areas and the 'good' pro-biotic bacteria in the yogurt will fight the 'bad' bacteria, helping to soothe the itch and reinforce the good bacteria.\n\nAnswer:",

Why is this?\nAnswer: The monarch butterflies (Danaus plexippus) are native to the Americas, where they migrate extensively. However, their migratory powers make it also possible for this species to be found in many parts of the world. \\nThe monarch larvae (caterpillars) feed on milkweeds (genus Asclepias in the Americas, Gomphocarpus in Africa), and they establish populations wherever they find these plants. Monarch butterflies have appeared in places where milkweeds were introduced (e.g. Hawaii). They occur also in Australia, Europe and Africa.\n\nAnswer:",

The company pays taxes on profits and subsequently distributes a dividend out of their after-tax profits. Shareholders must then pay tax on the dividend received.\\n\\nThe tax imputations indicate to the government that the company issuing the dividend has already paid a portion of the tax due.

I'm sure there are loads of good Muslim, Jewish, Hindu, Buddhist, and atheist kids all over the world. Why isn't Santa handing out presents to them? He's racist, that's why! We need to band together and sue his fat red ass off! Who's with me?\\n\\n(take this as a joke, people.^_^)\nAnswer: That's sooooooo been done.  Don't even bother.  Fortunately, Santa Claus, Inc., its trademarks, titles, and everything having to do with \"Santa Claus\" is covered under the \"religious\" protection under the Constitution.  If you believe in Santa Claus, then you can sue him---or his corporation.  If you do not believe in Santa Claus, then you have no grounds for a lawsuit because you are of a different \"faith/belief.\"\\n\\nAs you know, though-----there is no Santa Claus; the parents put the presents under the tree.  If you can find a Muslim who is really worried about it-----please take the bombs off his vest, sit him down, and you guys can talk about Santa.\\n\\nIf you can find a Hebrew person who is concerned about Santa, then ask him to put down his Torah, and sit down and talk to him about it.\\n\\nIf you can find a Buddhist who is concerned about Santa, then you can certainly Hmmmmmmmmmm your way into a conversation.\\n\\nIf you can find an atheist who is concerned about Santa, then they would have to believe in a giving, loving, spirit.  Sorry, that would make them something other than atheist.\\n\\nNow, if you're this concerned over Santa Claus, I suggest you contact your County Mental Health Department.  I'm sure you can find a counselor there who would be interested in sitting down and talking to you about it.\\n\\nOh, and----------HO HO HO....MERRY CHRISTMAS.\n\nAnswer:",

As positively identifying the occurrence of disease is usually based upon the presence of antibodies for that disease (especially with viral infections such as Herpes Simplex and HIV), this number is not significant if the specificity of the antibody is low.\n\nAnswer:",

She may suggest talking to the teacher, asking if there is an area you can improve on or something so that she thinks you're willing to work hard. Otherwise, maybe your guidance counselor can talk to her and find out if you did something or if there is something she is upset about so that it can be fixed and you can have a good year next year. \\n\\nAlso, it might be that you think she doesn't like you when the truth is she does and it's just her personality.

Hair that is wet through and through cuts like butter, a good razor blade will cut through it smoothly and effortlessly.  Hair that is not completely wet, however, can be as strong as reinforced concrete.  Cutting through such tough hair often causes hairs to be pulled up from their follicles as they are being cut.  These hairs then retract below the flush surface of skin where they are at risk for curving back into the skin as they grow rather than out through the follicle.  The forces required to cut such hair also can translate into more friction on the skin that can promote irritation.\\n\\nShave with downward strokes. (Go with the grain.)  Shaving in the same direction that the hair lies (typically down) will result in less pull on the hairs and less tendency to cut them too short.  Hairs cut too short are at risk of curling into the skin while growing and causing razor bumps and ingrown hairs.  Shaving with the grain will also minimize skin irritation.\\n\\nMinimize repeat shaving strokes.  Think of shaving as equivalent to mowing the lawn.  Not only is it a waste of time and energy in each case to go over and over the same area, but repeated shaving or mowing may result in things being cut too short.  On the skin, repeated shaving strokes increase the risk of ingrown hairs and skin irritation.  It is best to shave with just enough overlap to avoid skipping areas.\\n\\nShave with the skin in a neutral relaxed position.  This is the best way to shave hair close but not too close.  Sometimes the skin must be stretched very slightly to allow the razor to pass smoothly without nicking.  Excessive tightening of the skin when shaving, however, tends to result in hairs being shaved below the resting surface of the skin. This occurs because as the skin is stretched tight the hairs actually protrude out a bit farther than when the skin is relaxed.  Shaving over stretched skin may cut the hairs below the flush surface of resting skin, increasing the risk of ingrown hairs and also increasing the risk of skin irritation.\"\n\nAnswer:",

For your issue, this is only pertinent if you're using Internet Explorer, but it's always a good thing to do.\\n\\n(2) Make sure your screen resolution (right click on the desktop, properties, settings) is set to at least 800x600, preferably 1024x768.\\n\\n(3) Make sure the browser window is maximized.\\n\\n(4) Make sure you have IE, or preferably Firefox, from http://www.mozilla.com/\\n\\n(5) Make sure your text size is good.  With the two browsers mentioned above, click and hold the control key while you scroll the mouse wheel (if you have one) slowly up and down til you get what you want.\\n\\n(6) If you have some sort of ad-blocking software, turn it off and restart your browser.

The average seek time of a hard drive is around 8 milliseconds (how long it takes to find a file).  Considering that a computer can process stuff in the area of several billionths of a second (aka nanoseconds), the hard drive is much too slow to provide things for the cpu to process.  The purpose of RAM is to store data so it can be accessed faster than the hard drive.  RAM can work in a microsecond range, so it makes the computer that much faster.  The more RAM you have, the less often your computer must go to your hard drive.  \\n\\nThere is also what's called cache on your CPU (pronounced \"cash\") which further holds information before it gets processed.  The cache can work in the nanosecond range just like the processor.  \\n\\nThink of it this way:  Think of a carpenter as the CPU, think of his tool belt as the cache.  The carpenter can work faster if his tools are ready to use in his tool belt, however he can't carry that much in it.  It's because of this that he keeps most of his tools in his truck.  He can go to his truck to change which tools he has in his tool belt, but it's slower than if he has it right there.  This is why getting a CPU with as much cache as possible will result in a much faster machine.\\nCarrying on, it is a fact of life that you can only fit a limited amount of stuff in your truck, so you have to go to the hardware store to pick up more things.  Going to the hardware store is slow, and is much like having to go get data from the hard drive.  It is because of this that adding more RAM (buying a bigger truck, or adding a trailer) will certainly result in a faster computer.\\n\\nI hope this analogy helps you understand more about RAM and cache and the lot.\n\nAnswer:",

We have a month to try and help with diet and exercise.  Need help with the diet side.  Thanks!\nAnswer: When you eat, your body converts any food you don't need right away into triglycerides. Therefore, simply reducing the total amount of food you eat would reduce triglyceride levels. In addition to the amount of food, the kind of food matters, too. Avoid sugary foods, since they can raise triglycerides more than other healthy foods. Alcohol also has an even more potent ability to raise triglycerides, so avoid it. The same foods you would eat to be heart healthy (whole grains, low fat dairy, green vegetables) are the ones you would eat to reduce triglycerides. The Mayo Clinic has a wonderful article on this subject; please give it a click.  Good luck. http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/triglycerides/CL00015\n\nAnswer:",

I cant sell a thing..I dont have any feedback. people dont wanna buy from me because of my score. what should i do?\nAnswer: There are two ways to go about it:\\n\\n1. Buy from other sellers. What I did when I started was to look for any $0.99 items or cheaper, bid on it to get my score up.\\n\\n2. Review the way you sell your items. Many members realize that everyone starts from 0. In my other eBay account, I did not do #1 and instead proceeded to sell with 0 feedback. Buyers bought from me, no problem with 0 feedback. \\n\\nCheck if your item actually fits well with ebay - one of the realities of ebay is NOT all items can be sold on ebay. Do a search for completed items to see if people are buying your type of products, and for what price.\\n\\nAlso check your actual listing. Check the photos, check the titles of your listings to make sure the keywords are there, check the description, check your shipping and handling policies, check your payment policies. And if everything else fails, try to lower your price to get some bidding nibble.\\n\\neBay has several ways for you to determine exactly what the hot items to sell on their marketplace: \\n\\nItems In Demand = the most popular items currently within that particular category. To see the In Demand page, go to http://pages.ebay.com/sellercentral/sellbycategory.html  \\n\\nHot Items by Category Report = a monthly report that lists the fastest growing categories on eBay for the previous month. Go to http://pages.ebay.com/sellercentral/whatshot.html and select \"Hot Items by Category\" from the menu on the left. \\n\\neBay Pulse = \"a daily snapshot of current trends, hot picks, and cool stuff on eBay\". Go to http://pulse.ebay.com/ to see eBay Pulse in action. \\n\\nMerchandising Calendar = eBay promotes specific categories on its home page each month. Savvy eBayers know that this home page exposure results in more interest in such categories.

What do they believe?  How do they live?\nAnswer: To counter some of the misinformation of the previous answers:\\n\\nMormons \"don't have sex\" --actually Mormons DO have sex, just not supposed to before marriage and thereafter only with the person you are married to. \\n\\nMormons \"don't drink caffeine\" --actually a lot of Mormons do. What is not partaken of is Coffee, Tea, or any Alcohol. \\n\\nMormons \"have millions of kids\" --actually they only have a half millions kids. ;) There is currently no doctrine as to how many children families should have. Officially: Husband and Wife should decide (with God's help) how many children to have. \\n\\nMormons \"have arranged marriages\" --actually, I live in the heart of Mormonville and have NEVER heard of or seen a single Mormon couple wedded that had an arranged marriage. Official doctrine: it is your choice, not anyone else's. \\n\\nMormons \"believe they are each going to get their own planet\" --I dare you to find any high ranking Mormon leader within the last 100 years that has said anything to further that idea. \\n\\nMormons \"also believe in polygamy\" --Actually they only believe in it as much as most other Christians, that it was once practiced, but is no longer sanctioned. What Christian could say anything different? Abraham anyone? Isaac? Jacob? Yeah, so Mormons practiced it more recently than Christianity at large--but it is no longer practiced and any member who does practice it is excommunicated. \\n\\nAnd as for having a list as long as your arm as to what can get you cast into 'outer darkness'?? I would surely like to see that list as I have never even heard of it. As far as I've known in my 20+ years as a Mormon, you could count on one hand the things that will get you cast in to 'outer darkness' (one of the usages of \"Hell\"). \\n\\nPlease people, don't speak unless you know what you are talking about.

He drove three hours to spend the holiday weekend with me so I wanted to impress him with a home cooked meal.  I waited until leaving work Wednesday night to go the the grocery store and in the mad push of people, I reached in the bin and grabbed a turkey.  The next afternoon, I placed my turkey in a sink full of water to thaw and began on my side dishes.  After he arrived and we had a drink, he ventured into the kitchen at which point I noticed he was peering down into the sink and frowning.  I asked if something was wrong with the turkey and he said \"Yeah . . . it's a duck.\"  \\n\\nTo my horror, I had picked up a duck and never noticed that this long narrow bird was not a fat round turkey.  I attempted to roast it and while it had a nice flavor, we quickly realized there isn't much meat on a duck.  In addition, my gravy was burnt, my potatoes were salty and the macaroni and cheese was a solid block.  I finally accepted defeat and we ventured out to the local 7-Eleven and had a Thanksgiving hot dog!   \\n\\nI wouldn't have done a thing to prevent it!!  That night my husband told me he loved me for the first time and we have been together for over twelve years.  He turned out to be an incredible cook and  I have never cooked another Thanksgiving dinner!  And every year we toast our famous Thanksgiving duck!\n\nAnswer:",

Unless they\u2019ve broken a criminal law, internal affairs can\u2019t do anything.  If you\u2019re talking about a false arrest or getting caught in a sting operation, the best recourse is to appeal the conviction.   Almost 100% of the time the lower courts will side with the police officer, but in the appeals court, the decision often swings toward the plaintiff.\\n\\nFabricating lies and spreading them with the intention of causing harm to another person is a civil matter.  Slander and libel are difficult to prove.  First you must prove the person is lying, then you must prove they are spreading those lies with the sole intention of hurting you and then you must prove those lies have caused you to lose something i.e.: a job, money, your home, etc.  Call an attorney and see if you have a case, but chances are, you can\u2019t do anything.\\n\\nIf you have a video tape which contradicts even one sentence of the police report, you should appeal the case in a higher court.  All you have to do is catch them in one little lie to have the whole thing thrown out of court.\n\nAnswer:",

You do not have to get an undergraduate degree in Business, but this might make sense, if you really feel this is what interests you. But there are other potential majors, like marketing, communications, or finance, that could also be a great lead-in to a business career.\\n\\nHowever, as you recognize, some people become CEOs without ever going to college. Many worked their way into that position by starting their own companies. They were entrepreneurs who did not necessarily have any formal education but who did have a dream and the willingness to do the hard work it took to make it happen.\\n\\nSo...there's no one way to go about this. A lot depends on your personality, including whether you are really suited to the job towards which you aspire. Until you have more experience in the business world, you may not know. College is a good place to learn about yourself and what interests you. While you are in college, seek out internship opportunities to try out the fields in which you have an interest to discover if these are a good match for you.\n\nAnswer:",

It is one of the most common specific phobias. In survey research, six percent of the U.S. population claims to fear being sick, although a much smaller number suffer from actual emetophobia, which manifests itself through a variety of phobic behavior.\\n\\nNearly every emetophobic contracted their phobia as a result of a traumatic incident of vomiting that happened to them between the ages of six and ten. Most emetophobics claim they can will themselves to avoid vomiting, sometimes resulting in Irritable Bowel Syndrome, and other illness. A survey of an Internet group of emetophobics found that the average member had last vomited at least twelve years earlier. On average, it is suggested that most emetophobics have been sick five or fewer times in their lives.\\n\\nEmetophobics are known to go to great lengths to avoid people who may be sick, to avoid being in public places where people may do so, and above all, to practice eating habits in such a manner as to minimize the chance of their heaving - many emetophobics lead strict diet regimes and often avoid foods that are known to produce the most liekly chance of food poisoning - meat and dairy products for example. Most emetophobics have very specific diets, and avoid not only food that once caused them to vomit, but also anything they suspect of being a possible cause of such illness.\\n\\nAnxiety concerning vomiting, or being in close proximity to anyone that might vomit can cause irrational behaviour, and often induce panic attacks. Emetophobia can have a very difficult and stressful influence on everyday life, the very nature of the illness being ever present. Many emetophobics would rather face illness than face the fear of vomiting, and in almost every case, an emetophobics body would respond to this irrational fear. Most emetophobics fear vomiting themselves, but in some cases, it has been claimed that fear of seeing other people vomit can induce an even greater phobic response than if they were to be sick themselves/\\n\\nEmetophobia is treated in the way common to most specific phobias.\n\nAnswer:",

I'm not saying that all people think that way. There have been a lot of people coming around about the idea that there are aliens. Especially with all the rumors about Area 51 and government conspiracies.\\n\\nNow, back to the question \"are aliens real?\" There is a lot of theories stating that the human race has been down this road before. In other words, we have once been to this stage of technology, intelligence, etc. I am a Christian so I wouldn't exactly use the word \"evolved.\" Maybe \"adapted\" would be a better word. Is it possible that \"aliens\" could be human beings that left Earth for some reason and adapted to their new environment? That would explain the appearances of the aliens that people have claimed to have seen or been abducted by. The aliens probably wouldn't be a new species, but rather a new race of humans. For example, there are many different breeds and colors of dogs but they are all still dogs. That is the same with people. There are Americans, Chinese, Africans, Europeans, etc. But you still cannot deny that we are all human beings. Maybe we can think of aliens as our \"neighbors\" that moved away and changed.\\n\\nHere is another theory I have come up with. A look from a more Christian point of view. Perhaps God decided to make another race of humans like he made us. But maybe he put them far away so that the two races wouldn't interfere or \"bleed\" together. If God did actually make a new race of humans he could make them look however he wanted. He could make them as smart as he wanted. The list goes on and on.\n\nAnswer:",

You have three weeks.  You can do this and make a good grade, I promise.\\n\\nYour paper is supposed to be persuasive, so that means that you need to find a topic that has pros and cons.  And then you have to take a side, for or against.  Think about this one, because you want your topic to be something you care about.  If you care, you'll write a deeper, more impassioned paper, and earn a better grade.\\n\\nA word about topics: I'd steer clear of abortion, because it's personal.  What works for one person doesn't work for another, and there's no changing people's minds about deeply personal matters.  Likewise, I wouldn't recommend religion either.  Death and taxes are good, though.  Is burial better than cremation?  Should there be a flat tax or not?\\n\\nThe next step is your actual research.  Make sure that your topic isn't too broad (The Punic Wars) or too narrow (the use of the short sword in hand-to-hand fighting during the Punic Wars).  This means you're going to have to go to the library and read lots of books, and look online, and go through the archive stacks.  Expect to spend about one hour researching for every page you write.\\n\\nWhen writing a good research paper, it's important to think like a lawyer.  That is, you need to pretend as if you're presenting your paper as if it were a court case.  Your teacher is the judge, and the prosecution is out to disprove your case.  A really good persuasive paper takes into account all the \"Yeah, but what about...?\" questions.  If you can answer, logically, precisely and clearly, any questions that someone arguing the opposite point can bring up, you will prove your case, and make your argument airtight.  (I use argument here in the classic sense of presenting a thesis for consideration.)\\n\\nYour conclusion should not simply restate your introduction, but rather go beyond the introduction.  You should think critically and give valid, on-point reasons why your idea is better, more practical, more valid, and overall how it benefits people more.\\n\\nIf you can do this, you will have written an \"A\" persuasive paper.  Please feel free to contact me if you need anymore help.\\n\\nCheers, K (teacher for 14 years)\n\nAnswer:",

Fill your sink with water and float a bowl (boat) in it.  Then, fill the bowl with silver wear (body and rocks) or anything more dense than water.  Mark where the water level is on the side of the sink.  Now, take the silver wear out, and put it in the water so it falls to the bottom of the sink.  You will notice that the water level went down.  When the silver was in the bowl, it displaced much more water than when it was at the bottom of the sink.

Topic - is it appropriate for teenagers to have a computer in their room? (yeah i know it sucks but i'm just using it as an example..and let's say you think they shouldn't)\\n\\nnow, you should think in your head that your essay will be at least contain 5 paragraphs - 1 for introduction, 3 for the body of the essay, and 1 for conclusion.\\n\\nparagraph 1 - introduction - try to talk about how the computers and the internet have gotten so poppular these days and how much people love to spend time on it. Then at the end of the paragraph, point out the thesis which you think that teenagers should not allow to have a computer in their room - but one thing, try not to make it an announcement.\\n\\nnow you need to explain a few reasons why teenagers should not have a computer in their room in order to support your thesis..\\n\\nbody  - paragraph 1 - it's addicting and teenagers may end up spending a lot more time on the computer than what they really suppose to, other than doing their homeworks.\\n\\n        paragraph 2 -  people who spend a lot of time on the computers tend to get headaches and back pain as well as damage of the vision.\\n\\n        paragraph 3 - it causes lack of communication between the teenagers and their parents because teenagers tend to spend a lot of time in their room so they could access to the internet.\\n\\nlast paragraph - conclusion - well i think you already got the idea of how to write the conclusion but remember your conclusion paragraph needs to correspond with the introduction paragraph :]\\n\\ni hope this will help you a little more to understand how the body structure of an essay should look like. good luck :]\n\nAnswer:",

Is it legal to leave the state of Florida permenatly while on probation.  Can terms of probation be transfered to another state?  Before I hear a bunch of \"you shouldn't be driving drunk anyway\" answers, please know that this is not my situation, it's my brother... and yes, he needs help..\nAnswer: Where does your brother want to move to, and why does he want to move to that place?  Does he have any job prospects in the different state, or does he have immediate family in that state?  (Immediate family would be parents, siblings, spouse, or children.)\\n\\nIf he has immediate family in the other state, there is a presumptive approval of the transfer of probation.  Your brother needs to speak to his probation officer about transferring, and has to fill out the paperwork.  He will have to pay a fee, which is currently $75, to the Interstate Compact of Florida and be up to date on all his costs and fees.\\n\\nIf he wants to move but doesn't have immediate family in the other state, he can apply for transfer of probation, but the receiving state has the right to turn down the transfer.\\n\\nThese rules are the same for all states.  I'm an Indiana Probation Officer, and have some clients who were able to transfer, and some who were denied transfer.\n\nAnswer:",

I feel sad and upset most of the time.  \\n\\nNothing has worked out in my life and I feel like a total failure to the point where I did not want to spend Thanksgiving with family and friends that invited me.  They tried to reach out to me and I pulled back and could not return the feelings. \\n\\nI keep hoping that when I wake up in the morning one day I will feel strong and refreshed.  I do plan to see a therapist, but don't know how much help that will be. \\n\\nI am working at a job that I do not like but at least it gives me somewhere to go each day.  My child is living with my ex-husband and missing me. \\n\\nI don't feel like eating and really doing anything at all.  I try meditating, but can only do it for 10 minutes or so.  I do exercise as often as possible, but that has a limited effect. \\n\\nWhen will this sad, blue feeling end? I don't like being depressed.\nAnswer: Well chances are your not going to just wake up one morning and feel better.  You really need to talk to a doctor, either your family doctor or a psychiatrist.  A therapist is good but your probably going to need medication to help you get thought this.  Pulling away from family and friends is not healthy you need to socialize.  Unless you see all of your concerns and problems ending for the better this is going to drag on until you help yourself.  Make an appointment today and get on the road to recovery.  Hope this helps.

What impresses you the most about the games and will you continue watching soccer once the World cup is over?\nAnswer: No!  I have been watching the World Cup since 1990.  I went to the World Cup when the finals were at the Rose Bowl in Pasadena.  Sat in the second row, 50 yard line.  It's been an up and down of emotions these past years.  The thing that impresses me the most is the competition of teams when they play.  Each country does not want to let their country down by losing so they play hard.  I hope Ronaldo gets to play the next game for Brazil.  What do you think of the USA's opening game this past Monday?  Yes, I will keep watching the World Cup.  I have been playing soccer since 5 yrs. old.\n\nAnswer:",

It's worth noting that both times they've won the competition they had young squads (26 yrs & 3 mths in '78, 26 yrs 10 mths in '86). Also note that they took an older squad to Korea/Japan (28 yrs & 5 mths by my calculations). \\nI think they have a number of very exciting players. My personal favourites being Cambiasso, Riquelme, Messi & Crespo. \\nThey'll definitely be a hard team to beat, and I'm sure they'll make it at least as far as the semis - if not becoming the eventual winners.\n\nAnswer:",

That the earth is but a minute object in the Cosmos; that it forms one of a number of bodies, many of them larger than itself, revolving around their central luminary, the sun; that there exist in the realms of space myriads of similar suns, centres themselves of other solar systems; that millions of planets, which we cannot see, are inhabited with races of intelligent beings -- these are facts of which almost everybody must cognisant, but on which few bestow much time or thought.\\n\\nAstronomy teaches that, just as our solar system had a beginning, so it must have an end, and that, as at one time life was impossible upon the earth, so there will come a time when man will no longer be able to exist.\\n\\nScience, cold and calculating, has foretold the physical end of the world -- has prophesied the destruction of the globe and all its contents.\\n\\nBirth, life, death -- it has been well been said --appear to be the rule of the universe at large, as well as in our own little corner of it. Suns and planets are evolved, they flourish, and at length decay; and new suns and systems will arise to take their places.\\n\\nThe \"End of the World\" may be taken in two different senses, as meaning either the annihilation of our planet by sudden catastrophe, or by gradual decay, or else the disappearance of human life from the face of the globe, owing to some state of circumstances, possible, at any rate, if not probable.\\n\\nIt is our purpose in this article briefly to consider some of the opinions held by men of learning and repute regarding the end of the world, and to emphasise the lesson taught by Nature that the individual counts for nothing in the history of the race, the race for nothing in the life of the planet, and the planet for nothing in the duration of the Universe.\\n\\nVery many derive their inspiration on this absorbing subject from the Bible, where we read: \"The day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night; in the which the heavens shall pass away with a great noise, and the elements shall melt with fervent heal, the earth also, and the works that are therein, shall be burned up.\"\\n\\nEvery child knows that water was the agency of destruction in the ancient world, and that the rainbow was placed in the sky as a token that life should never be destroyed by this cause again. All through the Bible we may trace the prophecy that the world would come to an end by being consumed with fire.\\n\\nIt is out of our province here to touch on the signs given in the Bible whereby the arrival of the last day may be predicted. Certain preachers have brought great ridicule on themselves by their very certain statements on this point, but they seem little abashed when their prophecies do not come true, and merely alter dates and times to suit the next occasion.\\n\\nMany readers will call to mind a rhyme which at the time terrorised the minds of hundreds of thousands of young and ignorant people --\\n\\n\"The world unto an end shall come\\nIn Eighteen Hundred and Ninety-One.\"\\nThe date has been often changed and will (it may safely be said) continue to be changed for the benefit of future generations. It is curious to notice that hardly two philosophers agree as to the manner in which the end of the world may be expected to arrive. Some put their faith in a celestial catastrophe so terrible as literally to wipe our earth out of existence, while others prefer to believe that though man may no longer be able to exist, the world will still continue its appointed motions.\\nLord Kelvin startled us not long ago by affirming that there was only oxygen in the atmosphere sufficient to last mankind for some 300 years, and that the world was doomed to die of suffocation.

Unlike the myths that some perpetuate, federal government and even private foundations hardly give grant money for a for-profit business. And yes, grants mean PAPERWORK - lots and lots of it, that is why a cottage industry of grant writers was born.\\n\\nNonetheless, you can go to the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance (CFDA) http://www.cfda.gov and Grants.gov http://www.grants.gov - these are two sites created by the federal government to provide transparency and information on grants. Browse through the listings and see if you can find any grant that would support a for-profit venture.\\n\\nEven if you buy books on \"how to get grants\" or list that supposedly has information on grants -- all of them are mere rehash of what CFDA has, albeit packaged differently. But still the info is the same - hardly any grants for starting a for profit business.\\n\\nEven SBA does NOT give out grants. From the SBA website http://www.sba.gov/expanding/grants.html... \\n\\n\"The U.S. Small Business Administration does not offer grants to start or expand small businesses, although it does offer a wide variety of loan programs. (See http://www.sba.gov/financing for more information) While SBA does offer some grant programs, these are generally designed to expand and enhance organizations that provide small business management, technical, or financial assistance. These grants generally support non-profit organizations, intermediary lending institutions, and state and local governments.\"\\n\\nMost of the federal grants are given to specific target groups with specific requirements (e.g. minority business owners involved in transportation related contracts emanating from DOT - Grant#20.905 Disadvantaged Business Enterprises Short Term Lending Program \\n\\nGrants are also often given to non profit groups or organizations involved in training or other similar activities (grant 59.043 Women's Business Ownership Assistance that are given to those who will create women's business center that will train women entrepreneurs \\n\\nFor private grants, you may want to check the Foundation Center's Foundation Grants for Individuals Online. It's a subscription based website ($9.95 per month) but their opening blurb only says that the database is ideal for \"students, artists, academic researchers, libraries and financial aid offices.\" Entrepreneurs are apparently not one of them, so I take it they also don't have listings of private foundations who give grants to would-be entrepreneurs.\n\nAnswer:",

I exclaimed, How beautiful is this tree, and how delightful is its appearance!\" \\nIn western art, the fruit is most commonly depicted as an apple. One possible reason for this arises from a medieval pun. It was a source of humor to monks that the Latin term for evil (malus) was similar to the word of apple (malum). Thus it was often said that by eating the malum (apple), Eve contracted malus (evil). There is, however, no textual or historical evidence by which to argue the literalness of this image.\\n\\nJewish thought contains additional options. Rabbi Meir says: \"The fruit of (the Tree of Knowledge of Good-and-Evil) was a grape...\"; Rabbi Nechemia says: \"It was a fig...\"; Rabbi Yehuda says: \"It was wheat...\" Talmud, Brachot 40a\\n\\nThe reason it is sometimes surmised to have been a fig is that they used fig leaves to cover themself after eating it, either because the leaves were nearby, or because God creates the cure before the illness, and the same tree that caused the problem is also used to remedy it. Another explanation lies within the \"fruit\" of the fig tree, the fig itself, which is not actually a fruit but rather a flower of sorts, serving as the tree's genitalia. It is said that when they bit into the fig, they saw that what appeared to be a fruit on the outside had concealed the reproductive organs within itself. Adam and Eve then looked at each other and felt ashamed that their reproductive organs were simply exposed, and covered them with the large leaves from the same tree. Some commentators hold that it might have been a grape, and that Eve actually made, and drank, wine.\\n\\nEthno-botanists have proposed the iboga plant (Tabernanthe iboga) as the Tree of Knowledge. The ground up bark contains a dissociative substance, ibogaine, which has been traditionally used in Bwiti religious ceremony in Central Africa.

Therefore the world-wide human population density is 6.5 billion / 510 million = 13 per km\u00b2 (33 per sq mi), or 43 per km\u00b2 (112 per sq mi) considering that humans live on land, which forms 150 million km\u00b2 (58 million sq mi) of the earth. This density rises with the population growth, and some people think there is a limit of what the Earth can support.\\n\\nSeveral of the highest-density territories in the world are very small city-states, micronations or dependencies. These territories share a relatively small area and an exceptionally high urbanization level, with an economically specialized city population drawing also on rural resources outside the area, illustrating the difference between high population density and overpopulation.\\n\\nCities with exceptionally high population densities are often considered to be overpopulated, though the extent to which this is the case depends on factors like quality of housing and infrastructure or access to resources. Most of the largest densely-populated cities are in southern and eastern Asia, though Cairo and Lagos in Africa also fall into the category. City population is however, heavily dependent on the definition used for the urban area: densities will be far higher for the central municipality than when more recently-developed and as yet administratively unincorporated suburbs are included, as in the concepts of agglomeration or metropolitan area, the latter including sometimes neighbouring cities.\n\nAnswer:",

It is usually some kind of container filled with explosive material, designed to cause random destruction when set off. The word comes from the Greek \u03b2\u03cc\u03bc\u03b2\u03bf\u03c2 (bombos), an onomatopoetic term with approximately the same meaning as \"boom\" in English.\\n\\nThese are first and foremost weapons; the term \"bomb\" is not usually applied to explosive devices used for civilian purposes (such as construction or mining), although the people using the devices may or may not sometimes refer to them as bombs. Note that many military explosive devices are not called \"bombs\". The military mostly calls airdropped, unpowered explosive weapons \"bombs,\" and such bombs are normally used by air forces and naval aviation. Other military explosive devices are called grenades (such as hand grenades), shells, depth charges, warheads (in missiles), or land mines.\\n\\nThey have been used for centuries in warfare and are a central part of the terrorist's arsenal. They fall into three distinct categories: conventional (filled with chemical explosives), dispersive (filled with submunitions, chemicals or other disruptive agents which are spread on or shortly before impact) or nuclear (relying on nuclear fission or nuclear fusion for their effect).\\n\\n \\nDevice originally thought to be a pipe bomb, found to be a time bomb. From a U.S. government publication.A distinction is commonly drawn between terrorist and military bombs. The latter are almost always mass-produced weapons, developed and constructed to a standard design out of standard components and intended to be deployed in a standard way each time. By contrast, terrorist bombs are usually custom-made, developed to any number of designs, use a wide range of explosives of varying levels of power and chemical stability, and are used in many different ways. For this reason, they are generally referred to as improvised explosive devices or IEDs.\\n\\nThe most powerful bomb in existence is the hydrogen bomb, a nuclear weapon. The most powerful bombs ever used in combat were the two nuclear bombs dropped by the United States to attack Hiroshima and Nagasaki. The most powerful non-nuclear bomb is the United States Air Force's MOAB (Massive Ordnance Air Blast).\\n\\nThe most powerful bomb ever was Tsar Bomba: ca. 50 Mt; it had a mass of 27 tons; it was dropped from a bomber for a test, but was for various reasons not very suitable for combat.\\n\\nThe first hydrogen bomb Ivy Mike (10.4 Mt) was even heavier in mass, 82 tons. It was too heavy to be deliverable by a plane or rocket, and therefore not very suitable for an attack.\n\nAnswer:",

It was called a Tiger Slam instead of Grand Slam because he did not win them all in the same season. He won the PGA in the previous season and then won the other 3 the next year. Holding all 4 at one time is a truly remarkable accomplishment, and it merited having its own name, even though it was not done in the same season.\n\nAnswer:",

Does anyone know anything that would help her?\\nShe has constant pain in her legs mostly the right as over thelast few years she has fallen and broken the rt. leg about ten yrs ago and it healed crooked  Any ideas out there?\nAnswer: In its most general terms, neuropathy refers to a disorder of the peripheral nerves (the nerves in our legs, arms, etc.).  Neuropathy can be a chronic, painful, and often debilitating condition where the nerve experiences chronic inflammation and/or dysfunctions.  There are serveral types/causes of neuropathy including:\\n1. Diabetes\\n2. Alcoholism\\n3. Chronic nerve compression in the spine\\n4. History of crush injury\\n5. ...or even without a known cause, or idiopathic.\\n\\nStandard treatments usually include management of diabetes (in diabetic neuropathy) and use of medications which depress excitation of the nervous system such as neurontin or Lyrica. Unfortunately, these medications usually come with some hefty side effects.\\n\\nAnodyne therapy is a realtively new therapy, but there is still much to be learned about this.  It's a treatment usually performed by a physical therapist that uses monochormatic infrared light waves to stimulate blood flow to the nerves.  It is usually used as part of a comprehensive program of Anodyne, gait and balance training in order to reduce pain and increase function/quality of life.  \\n\\nFirst step is for her to consult with her primary physician or a neurologist.\n\nAnswer:",

It was originally released in a fold-out format, containing the first six tracks on a regular CD and an additional three-inch mini-CD with the remaining bonus tracks. It was later released as one CD, with the bonus songs as \"hidden\" tracks 98 and 99. The song \"Wish\", aided by the video directed by Peter 'Sleazy' Christopherson of Coil, won a Grammy in the \"metal\" category. Jon Reiss directed a music video for \"Happiness in Slavery,\" which was almost universally banned due to its graphic content. The video depicts performance artist Bob Flanagan strapping himself to a machine that subsequently pleasures, tortures and kills him. A video for \"Pinion\" aired twice on MTV before being banned for its objectionable content, although images from it did become a fixture in the opening title sequence of the MTV show Alternative Nation. A full length video informally called The Broken Movie was also made by Sleazy, but has not seen an official release. The Broken Movie, as of 2005, can only be found on bootleg. Broken was followed by the remix EP Fixed.\n\nAnswer:",

What kind of bike should I get for  long distance road rides?\nAnswer: It depends what you mean by 'long rides'. If you're going to do 100 miles a day for several days in a row, you need a touring bike. This is because its comfortable over long periods, its strongly built to take a lot of use and its specially designed to take panniers and a heavy load.\\n\\nIf you're going to ride fast over anything up to 100+ miles, but you're doing one day outings (or you're racing, or riding mainly for fitness) then get a road bike - light, fast, responsive (a thoroughbred amongst bikes). Like a thoroughbred horse though, these bikes need tender loving care to stay on top form, they're a bit skittish and they're fragile. They're also not the most comfortable ride, because they're built for speed, not comfort.\\n\\nIf you're doing 50+ miles on mixed terrain and speed is less important than durability and stability, then get an ATB of some kind. Probably a hardtail with good front suspension.\\n\\nIf you're mainly pottering about (even over quite long distances) and most of your riding is in the city, on road and light trails, then consider another hybrid. These are tough, flexible and easy to live with. There are some interesting gearhub ones appearing - they really make life easy.\\n\\nMy first try-outs in each category:\\n\\nTouring - Cannondale, Specialised\\n\\nRoad - Bianchi, Trek, Cannondale\\n\\nATB - Klein, Specialised, Trek.\\n\\nHybrid - Cannondale (especially the Vintage), Specialised\n\nAnswer:",

How can I show her I care about her feelings?\nQuestion: She says all I care about are my feelings. I do all sorts of sweet stuff for her, like take her out to movies, dinner, trips, etc.. I treat her like gold. So how can I show her I care about her feelings?\nAnswer: You mentioned many good things to not only impress a woman but to keep her satisfied materialistically. However, in my experience, when a woman says that you don't care about her feelings that usually means she feels that you don't listen to or try to help her with her problems or you don't ask for or respect her opinions. Both of these will require you to work on your listening skills. In the case of her problems she may only require someone to listen to her, if you have any advice, guidance or help to give then by all means give it. If not, then let her know that you will be there for her if she needs something from you. In the case of her opinions not only will you have to ask for them but also do what she wants to do, even when you don't want to.\\nGifts, trips, dates, these are all things that all women want, but they are far from ways that show that you care. Listening, offering your service, and respecting her opinion are but some of the ways to show a woman that you care about her feelings.\n\nAnswer:",

We normally see the sky as blue because the sky scatters higher wavelengths of light more then lower wavelengths of light.  Blue is a short wavelength while red is a long wavelength.  Anyway, when the sun is rising or setting on the horizon you are looking through much more air to see the sun then say, at noon when the sun is straight over head.  There is so much air that you see the red, instead of the blue, because the blue has long since scattered off while the red is still able to travel through the atmosphere to your eyes.\n\nAnswer:",

Unlike other types of electricity generation only a tiny proportion of the cost of generating nuclear power is in the actual fuel burned. \\n\\n\\nFuel is very easy and cheap to transport. A coal or gas power station will burn tonnes of fuel every day. A nuclear power station will burn only a few grams. Because so little fuel need sot trannsported the amount of auilliary grenhouse gas pollution form transport is almost nil, as opposed to thousands of tonnes a year from coal or gas transport.\\n\\nSafe. Coal or gas power is a highly dangerous way to generate gas. In the US alone dozens of people are killed each year mining and transporting coal and gas for power generation and hundreds more die as a result of the pollutants these stations produce. If the same amount of power were generated using nuclear stations fewer than 10 people would die. \\n\\nAccidents in nuclear power generation is also far less likely to result in a loss of life. Chernobyl was the worst accident ever in the history of nuclear power generation and killed less than 50 people. There have been numerus mine accidents in the US that have killed more than 10 people at a time.\\n\\nUnder safety I will also include the very low levels of radioactivity released. In the US alone around 10 people a years are killed by radioactive materials released by coal power stations. Nobody in the US has ever been killed by radioactive material from nuclear power stations. Fewer than 100 people have been killed by the radioactive material released by nuclear power stations in the last 50 years in the entire world. \\n\\n\\nNon-polluting. Aside from making nuclear power generation very safe the almost total lack of unintentional pollutants is a major environmental bonus for nuclear power. Nuclear power stations contribute just 1/100, 000th of the amount of greenhouse gas as a coal or gas plant generating the same power.\\n \\nAbundant fuel. The world has about enough liquid rude oil to practically last about another 100 years at current consumption and extraction rates. Coal will see us through another 400 years if we sue it as an oil supplement. We have sufficient fissionable material available to provide 10, 000 years of nuclear power even if we abandon coal and oil altogether and get ALL our energy from nuclear power.\\n\\n\\nDisadvantages\\n\\nWaste disposal. This is the biggest problem. Nuclear power plants produce radioactive material that takes thousands of years or longer to become safe. Until it does decay to a safe level it has to be stored where it can\u2019t contaminate the water supply or stolen by people who want to use it as a poison. That requires either the construction of expensive containment facilities or the permanent lockdown of decommissioned stations so the material can be stored on site.\\n\\nStations are relatively expensive to build. Due to pressure from environmental lobby groups nuclear power stations are more heavily regulated than any other industry, far more heavily regulated than coal power stations or even coal mines and far more heavily indicated than the statistical danger warrants. IN addition any proposed nuclear power station will be the target of protests, endless legal challenges and direct acts of sabotage from \u2018environmentalists\u2019. Those factors make it far more expensive to build a nuclear power station in the US than to build a coal or gas station.\\n\\nPortability. Nuclear power requires nuclear reactors, big nuclear reactors. That means they are restricted to use in large ocean going vessels, trains and as stationary electrical generators. You can\u2019t use nuclear power to directly power cars, trucks, and airplanes. That means that nuclear power can never directly replace a large amount of US fossil fuel use. The issue of portability can be offset somewhat by using nuclear electricity to convert plant material or even air and water into petroleum, but doings o is fairly expensive.\n\nAnswer:",

It's a time for resolutions, a custom that goes back several millennia to the Babylonians, whose most popular one reportedly was to return borrowed farm implements. Nowadays, we're more likely to resolve to become better, skinnier, more fit, more patient, and smoke-free.\\n\\nParties, champagne and fireworks are common around the globe, but there are some more idiosyncratic customs as well. In Spain, 12 grapes are eaten during the last 12 seconds of the outgoing year (Peruvians eat 13). People who belong to polar bear clubs may indulge in a refreshing icy dip; the Coney Island Polar Bear Club of NYC has been doing this on New Year's Day since 1904. One Hogmanay custom popular in northeast Scotland is fireball swinging, which involves marching through the streets while twirling three-foot flaming balls on six-foot chains.\\n\\nOther places tend to drop things during the final countdown to midnight. The most famous, in Times Square, is a 1,070-pound, 6-foot Waterford crystal ball, but other choices in various US cities include a pine cone, a pickle, a pretzel, and a live opossum in a cage.\n\nAnswer:",

If the child has special needs (which also includes gifted children) that the school system is not handling properly, then certainly homeschooling is an option.  If the school is teaching things the parents would rather the child not learn, or conversely, the public school is NOT teaching things the parents feel their child should know about, then homeschool is an option.  However, it requires a great deal of commitment, as well as time, energy, and effort on the part of the parents to do it well - you can't just set some workbooks in front of your child and say, \"Do pages 41-45.\"  \\n\\nAs far as socialization is concerned, that is only an issue if the parent makes it one by not allowing their child to interact with others in the world around them.  The homeschool kids I know are all very sociable and able to relate to those who are both older and younger.  My own kids have many friends, both within the homeschool community and without (in public school).\\n\\nIn the end, it comes down to personal preference.\n\nAnswer:",

I send my daughter to a private Christian school. Some people think it's too expensive to send their kids to Christian school, but I tell you it doesn't cost any more than daycare. Most of you probably send your kids to daycare, don't you? Also, you can't put a price on a good Christian education.  They have smaller teacher:student ratios, they focus on academics, they learn good morals, they are allowed to worship as they please (in accordance with the 1st Amendment), they score higher than the national average on tests, and they help to create productive members of society. They are not crime-and-drug ridden like so many public schools. \\nA public school would be the last place I'd send my child if I could help it.\\nIf, however, I did have to send here there, I would be on those teachers, principal and school board like white on rice. I would give them notes saying that they are not to teach my children evolution or any sex education (especially presented by Planned Parenthood!) or any \"diversity\" training (which is really just pro-gay propaganda). I will NOT have my child brainwashed by the public school system. You should be aware that the creation of a free, public school system was one of the tenets of Karl Marx's Humanist Manifesto, which was implemented by Teddy Roosevelt in this country. In fact, most of the tenets of that Manifesto were accomplished in this country in the first half of the 20th century. We have slowly become a socialist nation.\\nBefore that time, children were either home-schooled or private-schooled - and some of the best, most intelligent people our country has ever produced were educated thusly.\n\nAnswer:",

My boyfriend on the other hand wants a little reception and me to get a wedding dress. How do I convince him that the meaning is still there, without all the extras\nAnswer: The two of you need to sit each other down and reach an agreement because you want different things. Together I'm sure that you will be able to reach a compromise, the thing is if you have a church wedding and invite friends and family they will expect you to have a reception afterwards. Or why don't you suggest that instead of having a reception you just take a few close family members and friends to a restaurant and have a meal, which would be nice.  Also wedding dresses come in all shapes, and styles explain to him that you don't want a fancy wedding dress just something that is simple. After all it's your wedding day and as long as the two of you are happy with what you decide to do then that is the main thing. It's your wedding you don't necessarily have to have all the extras. Remember the most important thing is your life after the wedding\n\nAnswer:",

In the beginning, she would right me notes and emails all the time.  We would talk on the phone for hours.  We hung out all the time and just loved each others' company.  Soon, I felt myself falling in love with her.  Now over a month later, I am getting mixed signals.  One day, she wants to be alone to think about things, and the next, she goes out and buys me gifts and wants to be with me till the wee hours of the night.  I honestly don't know what to think.  It can't be that I don't treat her well because I always ask her how her day was, compliment her attire, bring her flowers when she least expects them, take her out to dinner, etc.  Most of all, though, I respect her and put her wants/needs before my own. She has even said I'm the best boyfriend ever, and that I'm perfect, which I am far from btw.  \\n\\nAnyway, I just don't understand how someone can act one way and then act totally opposite.  Can anyone help me?  Thx\nAnswer: i think it sounds like she has someone else hitting up on her and she wants to be with you but finds something interesting about the other one.\n\nAnswer:",

The term buccaneer is used to describe only those pirates who operated in the Caribbean..\\n\\nBuccaneer is a term that was used in the later 17th century in the Caribbean Islands. The term Buccaneer comes from the French word \"Boucanier\". These Boucaniers originally were hunters who were poaching cattle and pigs. They would smoke the meat on wooden frames, \"boucans\", so that it could be saved for a later time. The Boucaniers were taught this by the local Arawak tribes from Santo Domingo, calling the method Barbicoa - which is where the word and method of Barbecue originated.\\n\\nHowever, Islanders soon began to use the term buccaneer as a way to describe pirates in the Caribbean during the 1660s. English settlers occupying Jamaica began to spread the name with the meaning of rebel pirates sailing in the Caribbean ports and seas\n\nAnswer:",

You will need to check your local laws.  It is legal in the state of Georgia, albeit not encouraged.\\n\\nHuman avoidance of inbreeding occurs because it increases the probability that the offspring will be homozygous for particular harmful recessive alleles.  \\n\\nFor example if hemophilia runs in your family and you marry a first cousin like many of the European royal families did, there is a relatively high chance that your children will develop the disorder because you and your cousin are likely to be carriers of the gene.\\n\\nThere is also the probability that even if a particular disease does not run in your family, if a child is homozygous for enough slightly bad genes (say at 10) that the small effects of each gene will build up to produce a drastically detrimental effect.  \\n\\nIf someone and his or her cousin still wish to have children together, they may want to invest in genetic counseling to insure that they are not both carriers for a severe genetic disorder.\n\nAnswer:",

Is its current shrinking part of a normal cycle for the lake, or is global warming (or human usage or something else) making this worse than the past shrinkages? Is this shrinking permanent?\\n\\nLake Chad is often used as a prime example of global warming, but I don't understand how the current shrinkage is different than in the past.\nAnswer: You have a reasonable argument that current shrinkage may not be that different from the past: \\nThis from USGS web site:\\nFluctuations are not new to Lake Chad. About 10,000 years ago Lake Chad almost filled its present drainage basin, and spilled southwest out the Benue River to the Atlantic. In the last 1,000 years, according to fossil evidence, the lake probably dried out a half-dozen times. (Most of its fish are river-adapted species.) Geologic data, climate data, historical accounts and reconstructions all indicate a higher long-term variability than the relatively short period we have actually measured. The chart shown here shows levels since the 1870s, from actual measurements and from estimates based on Nile River discharge.6\\n\\nFollowing highs in the 1870s and 1890s, the lake dropped enough by 1908 to separate into north and south pools, with the \"Great Barrier\" between. In the 1950s the lake rose enough to flood out irrigation systems, peaking this century in 1962. The lake then tapered off until the early 1970s, when it plummeted. The recent low levels are a concern, and have been monitored through satellite and other means by the Lake Chad Basin Commission and others.==url below\\n\\nWhether or not it has dried out in the past, people have come to rely on it. Worrisome, I'm sure, to government agencies concerned with food supplies, irrigation, biodiversity, water availability etc.  And I would suppose that any future increase in drought or temperature  warming would guarantee a smaller lake, or its disappearance again.\n\nAnswer:",

From a Hindu perspective, the Sanatana Dharma propounds eternal and universal principles with no beginning or end. Hindu puranas and astronomical evidence within place Lord Krishna's birth at a date of 3100 BCE Krishna's incarnation was preceded by Lord Rama's, sometimes dated at over 5,000 BCE, or even millions of years ago according to the Ramayana. It is believed by many Hindus that their religious tradition was fully formed by the time of Lord Rama, believed to be the seventh incarnation of Lord Vishnu. Modern indology, on the other hand, suggests that Hinduism only developed sometime between 1500-1300 BCE based on the linguistic and literary dating of the Rig Veda, the oldest of the Hindu spiritual texts. This, however, is based on the Aryan invasion theory, which has increasingly been doubted due to archaeological findings suggesting that there was never such an invasion.\\n\\nThe origin of collective Hindu thought cannot be ascribed to any single founder (though most of its later schools of philosophy and belief can be), or associated with a specific time or a single place of foundation. The Vedas, the earliest Hindu scriptures, are the compilation of spiritual laws and truths binding upon all of creation. It is believed that each Veda was revealed to enlightened sages, called ri\u015fhis, over a long period of time. The Vedas are said to have been transmitted to Lord Brahma by Lord Krishna via meditative trance at the beginning of each creation.\\n\\nThe term 'Hindu' itself is a corrupt form of the word 'Sindhu', which literally means 'dweller across the Indus Valley'. The religion is often named (more appropriately) as Sanatana Dharma in all of its books. Hinduism, along with Buddhism and Jainism, is regarded to be an Arya Dharma, meaning, a noble religion.\n\nAnswer:",

Or some people just have them removed for the hell of it?\nAnswer: Generally speaking, tonsils are taken out for recurrent infection (tonsillitis, \"strep throat\" etc) or if they are so large that they are obstructing the upper airway or causing problems eating.   They are a small part of a person's immune system.  They do not serve to prevent infections from going into the lungs.  There is a significant amount of \"tonsil\" tissue that is left in place on the back portion of the tongue when tonsils are removed.  Studies done looking at the impact on the immune system agree that patients without their tonsils (and adenoid) are no more likely to catch an illness than patients with tonsils.\n\nAnswer:",

COBRA is a federal mandate for continuing health benefits when a qualifying event occurs such as divorce, for employers with 50 and over full and part time employees.  On the day the divorce becomes final, the employee should notify their employer and paperwork will then be sent to the ex-spouse notifying them of their right to continue medical benefits under the group's plan up to 36 months.  The paperwork must be completed and return within the specified time frame.  The monthly premium payment due is the full amount the insurance carrier charges the employer and the employer can add up to 2% of the cost to administer the paperwork.\n\nAnswer:",

An El Ni\u00f1o is associated with warm and very wet summers (December-February) along the coasts of northern Peru and Ecuador, causing major flooding whenever the event is strong or extreme. The effects during the months of February, March and April may become critical. Southern Brazil and northern Argentina also experience wetter than normal conditions but mainly during the spring and early summer. Central Chile receives a mild winter with large rainfall, and the Peruvian-Bolivian Altiplano is sometimes exposed to unusual winter snowfall events. Drier and hotter weather occurs in parts of the Amazon River Basin, Colombia and Central America.\\n\\nDirect effects of El Ni\u00f1o resulting in drier conditions occur in Indonesia, increasing forest fires, in the Philippines, and northern Australia. Drier than normal conditions are also generally observed in Queensland, inland Victoria, inland New South Wales and eastern Tasmania during June-August.\\n\\nWest of the Antarctic Peninsula, the Ross, Bellingshausen, and Amundsen Sea sectors have more sea ice during El Ni\u00f1o. The latter two and the Weddell Sea also become warmer and have higher atmospheric pressure.\\n\\nIn North America, typically, winters are warmer than normal in the upper Midwest states and Canada, while central and southern California, northwest Mexico and the southeastern U.S., are wetter than normal. Summer is wetter in the intermountain regions of the U.S. The Pacific Northwest states, on the other hand, tend to be drier during an El Ni\u00f1o. During a La Ni\u00f1a, by contrast, the Midwestern U.S. tends to be drier than normal. El Ni\u00f1o is also associated with decreased hurricane activity in the Atlantic.\\n\\nFinally, East Africa, including Kenya, Tanzania and the White Nile basin, experiences in the long rains from March to May wetter than normal conditions. There also are drier than normal conditions from December to February in south-central Africa, mainly in Zambia, Zimbabwe, Mozambique and Botswana\"\\n\\nsource: \\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/El_nino\n\nAnswer:",

What does that mean?\\n\\nSuppose you want to detect a certain tone. An FT (Fourier Transform) could take the input from a microphone. Imagine that the input is a sine wave at one frequency (say 1kHz). Then the output will be a \"spike\" at 1kHz since the x axis of the FT is frequency. Feed the spike to the inverse transform and you'd get the sine wave back out.\\n\\nSo frequency detection is one application. If you put a square wave in, you'd find that the square wave has a spike at the fundamental frequency and spikes at the odd harmonics. If you don't belive that, try sketching some sine waves at f, 3*f, 5*f, 7*f, and add them together (easy with Excel or Matlab) and watch how quick it \"squares\" up.\\n\\nAnother application is filtering. Manipulating data in the frequency domain allows you to build very sharp filters... then passing it through the inverse transform produces the signal after filtering.\\n\\nThere are other applications such as correlation, tomography, etc.\\n\\nIn the real world, you probably use a Discrete FT (DFT) and probably an FFT (Fast FT) which is a specific computer algorithm for a DFT. DFT means that the input is sampled as it would be for a computer. Computers don't read sine waves, they read little points on sine waves every X microseconds. The frequency they read the signal must be at least twice the frequency of interest, or you won't get proper results.\n\nAnswer:",

Wait 10 mins. You'll see two layers, a top layer and bottom layer.\\n\\nChloroform has a density of 1.48 g/mL and water has a density of 1 g/mL, so the chloroform will be the bottom layer. Use the sep funnel to recover all the chloroform. At the end, I'd run saturated sodium chloride through the chloroform and separate that, to clear any nonorganics from the chloroform.\\n\\nAfter that, you can put the chloroform on a rotavap or do TLC to see if you have caffeine and caffeine only (doubtful)\n\nAnswer:",

In fact at any speeds, but things only get a lot different from what we are used to, when speeds are close to the speed of light. The theory is essentially founded on the observation that the speed of light is constant to an observer regardless of how fast the observer is moving. Which is very different from the behaviour of objects with mass such as cars an the like.\\n\\nThe general theory of relativity extends on the special theory of relativity and is actually a refinement of earlier theories of gravity.\\n\\nI would suggest that if you want to understand relativity, that you first investigate \"classical physics\" or \"Newtonian physics\".\\n\\nDon't worry that you are only 11, if you want to understand these things then investigate them. If you get bored with them then you can stop investigating them. And make sure you have plenty of fun too.\\n\\nOh, and the famous equation actually an expression of the fact that mass can be converted in to energy, and energy can be converted into mass.\\n\\nAfter reading a couple of the answers below I feel that they could be a little misleading, so I would like to point out that the concept, or \"theory\" if you please, of \"relative motion\" was well established, before Einstein proposed his theories named \"special relativity\" and \"general relativity\".\n\nAnswer:",

That sounds great.  Now for the reality check.  Most 'entry level' investment jobs involve lots of phone calls with potential clients.  If you're not 100% adept at phone etiquette, you probably couldn't get that position, and I don't think the technology that you'd be using as a deaf person has yet reached the stage where that would be the case.  So, I think you'd be realistically limited from a lot of the entry level jobs.\\n\\nSince you're effectively barred from those jobs, you're stuck going after the few other entry level jobs in research, etc.  Now for the good news.  Those phone jobs are crappy jobs anyway.  That's where most new college grads get stuck, and it's miserable, and most of them give up within a year.  Instead, you're stuck with the better jobs.  Sure, they're going to be harder to get, cuz there are fewer of them, and many firms aren't organized to take entry level people in any other function.  But this will just assure you that you'll keep looking until you find a good position.  So, with that limitation, yes, it is hard for anyone to get one of those good entry level positions.  You'll just have to persevere.  That's a good thing because you won't make it in the investment world unless you have a lot of perseverence anyway.\\n\\nBy the way, I'd suggest playing to your strengths.  Consider what areas of the investment business you'd be strongest at, and which areas you'd be weakest in, and focus your attention on your strengths.  If you're a good writer and researcher, apply for positions with research firms or publishers.  If you're better at portfolio management, perhaps mutual funds would be a good direction to pursue.  If you're into sales, I suppose I'd look toward the big brokerage firms.  \\n\\nBest of luck to you.\n\nAnswer:",

They could quite possibly be warts, and they are completely treatable and removable.  You would want to do that before having sex, because it would be extremely inconsiderate of you to share them with another person.  You will not die from them at any rate.  Go see the doctor.  He/she will evaluate them and decide on the best way to remove them.  Normally they are removed either with applications of liquid nitrogen to freeze them, or painting with a mild salicylic acid solution.  It may take several applications to completely remove them, but eventually they will go.\\n  You may not even actually have genital warts.  You might just have several flat moles, or raised skin areas.  You will not know for certain until you go see the doctor and have them evaluated.  There is no need to be embarassed about it, or ashamed.  Doctors see it fairly frequently, and treat it.  You wouldn't be the first, and you won't be the last.  As personal as it is to you, it isn't to them.   There is nothing you own that will shock a doctor.  I've been a nurse and paramedic for more than 20 years, and it's not even close the first time I've heard this story.   You won't die from embarassment, and there's no need to be embarassed.  Just make the appointment, and go see the doctor.  You will leave feeling much better and much relieved, I promise.\n\nAnswer:",

The more proximal effect of a change in the sodium-potassium pump is a partial depolarization of neurons, because of an inability to maintain the ionic gradient critical for hyperpolarization...If an increased number of sodium ions enter the neuron, then it becomes much more excitable, and will fire more frequently.  This can lead to over activation of the sympathetic nervous system, which will, among other things, cause vasoconstriction (narrowing of the arteries), increased heart rate, etc- It would be a classic stress response, and lead to high blood pressure, which in turn can cause congestive heart failure and hemorrhagic stroke.  If there is a significant malfunction of this enzyme in the central nervous system (i.e. brain and spinal cord), it would cause death.\n\nAnswer:",

If your pet is infested with scabies, (also called mange) and they have close contact with you, the mite can get under your skin and cause itching and skin irritation. However, the mite dies in a couple of days and does not reproduce. The mites may cause you to itch for several days, but you do not need to be treated with special medication to kill the mites. Until your pet is successfully treated, mites can continue to burrow into your skin and cause you to have symptoms.\"\\n\\nSo the answer to your question is yes they can have scabies, but a different type.\n\nAnswer:",

Be honest!!?\nQuestion: How do you feel when students leave your class early or don't come at all?  I've been doing this in some of my classes but I don't know if my teachers are offended or if they will not pass me b/c of this.  Thanks for your input!!!!\nAnswer: I have my attendance policy written on all of my syllabi.   Most of my colleagues do as well.  Usually, there are consequences for missing more than three classes, but these consequences vary from professor to professor.  In my classes, grades begin to drop after three unexcused absences.\\n\\nHowever, some professors run their classes in such a way that absences do not impact students' grades.  Professors who have classes like this usually believe that it is a student's responsibility to engage with the material, and if they do not, it is the student's loss, and not the professor's concern.\\n\\nEvery professor I know believes that it is rude and disruptive when students leave class early.   Although I've never failed a student for this, my attitude toward them is certainly affected by their disrespectful behavior.   I'd be much less likely to extend myself to help, or to accept the excuses of a student who regularly demonstrates that they do not respect my life's work.  \\n\\nWhen students need to leave class early for important appointments (medical or otherwise), or will be missing a class for specific reasons, they usually contact me beforehand and let me know.  When they demonstrate both good manners and a sense of adult responsibility by doing this, I am completely understanding, and am not at all offended.\n\nAnswer:",

He's one of the most original and electrifying athletes in the ring.  He's the only wrestler that has made it in the movie industry, that tells you something.\\n\\nThe only 2 wrestlers close to Rock would be Stone Cold Steve Austin and Hulk Hogan.  Hogan had good Mic Skills, but had awful in-ring skills.  Hogan also wasn't very original.  Stone Cold was fun to watch inside and outside of the ring, but Stone Cold eventually got old and boring.\\n\\nThe Rock is never boring and that's the truth, he went out on top, and everybody's hoping he'll come back.\\n\\nOn a side note, I believe the best in-ring wrestler in history is Kurt Angle.\n\nAnswer:",

They collapsed becaue the steel columns that held up the buildings buckled. When steel is exposed to high temperatures for an extended period of time, its elastic modulus (or stiffness) decreases at a very fast rate. It is believed that the protective fire coating was blown off the steel at the initial impact, causing the steel to be exposed to higher temperatures for a longer period of time. \\n\\nThe steel columns in the building were connected by trusses that were supposed to support their own weight, the weight of the concrete floors, and the weight of all the office equipment. The high temperature damaged the material and one floor collapsed onto another. Once the first floor collapsed, all the floor above it lost their support and fell.\n\nAnswer:",

No.\\n\\nGiven some of the political views I have posted on Y!A, it might surprise some people to find out that I refuse to watch either film.

I am interested in learning FACTS. My OPINIONS do not need help being shaped from either Michael Moore or Alan Peterson.\\n\\nThe better documentaries about 9/11 have explored both sides of the events while ignoring obvious left and right-wing propaganda. President Bush's response on 9/11 was not perfect; he DID make some mistakes. But he did a lot of things right, too.\\n\\nKSM (Khalid Sheik Mohammed - that real hairy bastard nabbed in Pakistan a year or so back) has stated in interrogation that al Qaida had planned MORE attacks on the US immediately following 9/11. What al Qaida had NOT expected, however, was President Bush's response. Al Qaida expected a few cruise missiles as an answer, and then life would go on. The Bush Doctrine (\"you are either with us or against us\") and the military operations that accompanied it totally threw al Qaida for a loop and disrupted any chance they had of launching another operation.\\n\\nThe KSM statement alone shows that President Bush has done his job and saved the lives of THOUSANDS - if not tens or hundreds of thousands - of American lives.\n\nAnswer:",

Will it come out through the other side? What will be the result?\nAnswer: Ignoring the following things: the rotation of the earth, and the fact that the earth is not solid all the way through...\\n\\nIf you drilled a hole all the way through and dropped a stone in, it would accelerate until it got to the center of the earh, then it would start to decelerate.  It would ALMOST make it to the other side.  The reason it wouldn't make it all the way is because some of its kinetic energy was lost to friction with the air in the hole.  After it got as far as it could go, it would start to come back, and it would travel even less distance before starting to \"fall\" again.  Each time it would lose a little more energy until it eventually would come to rest at the center of the earth.  And note that the stone wouldn't be resting ON anything, it would just be at rest, in \"mid-air\", if you like.  \\n\\nIf you want to go one step further and ignore friction, the stone WOULD make it to the other side, but just barely.  If no one were there to catch it, then it would just oscillate back and forth forever, from the point where you dropped it to its antipodal* counterpart.\\nThis would make a good method of travel, no?  Just hop in the hole, and in a little while you'd pop out the other side of the earth, as if you'd just teleported or something (of course this is a non- physical scenario). \\n\\n*vocab:\\nantipodal points = opposite points on a sphere\n\nAnswer:",

It is not sufficient to just have 4 years experience and it is unlikely that work experience before you graduated will be counted. \\n\\nTo calculate your work experience when you were working part time you need to show that you were working part time at least 20 hours per week - for every year you were working 20 hours per week you can claim 6 months full time work experience.\\n\\nIf you need further information you can email me on answers@visalogic.net\n\nAnswer:",

Having promised to cease singing at 8:30 p.m., the marchers did so. Although petitioners and the other demonstrators continued to march in a completely lawful fashion, the onlookers became unruly as the number of bystanders increased. Chicago police, to prevent what they regarded as an impending civil disorder, demanded that the demonstrators, upon pain of arrest, disperse. When this command was not obeyed, petitioners were arrested for disorderly conduct. \\n\\nThe opinion of the Supreme Court of Illinois suggests that petitioners were convicted not for the manner in which they conducted their march but rather for their refusal to dispense when requested to do so by Chicago police.  However reasonable the police request may have been and however laudable the police motives, petitioners were charged and convicted for holding a demonstration, not for a refusal to obey a police officer.\n\nAnswer:",

Whereas Homer\u2019s first epic treats Achilles\u2019 rage, this one focuses on a \u201cman of twists and turns.\u201d It chronicles not battles, the stuff of Achilles\u2019 brief life, but a long journey through \u201c[m]any cities\u201d and \u201cmany pains,\u201d the kind of test worthy of a resourceful hero like Odysseus. The opening lines foreshadow how the epic will end\u2014with all of Odysseus\u2019s men dead except Odysseus himself\u2014and provide a reason for these deaths: the recklessness and blindness of his crew , who do not realize that by slaughtering the Sun\u2019s cattle they seal their own dooms. The opening leaves unmentioned many other temptations the Achaeans will face and says nothing of the situation in Ithaca, which consumes nearly half the epic. It treats the subject matter of the epic in an abbreviated form but captures the themes those subjects will explore. As Knox notes in the introduction to the Fagles translation, in the Odyssey, in contrast to the Iliad, the Muse is asked to choose where to begin. Giving the Muse this freedom prepares us for the more complex narrative structure of the Odyssey, which relies on flashbacks as it moves through the many settings of the hero\u2019s ten-year journey.\\n\\n\\n2.Of all that breathes and crawls across the earth,\\nour mother earth breeds nothing feebler than a man.\\nSo long as the gods grant him power, spring in his knees,\\nhe thinks he will never suffer affliction down the years.\\nBut then, when the happy gods bring on the long hard times,\\nbear them he must, against his will, and steel his heart.\\nOur lives, our mood and mind as we pass across the earth,\\nturn as the days turn . . .\\n\\nmeaning-Odysseus utters these words to the suitor Amphinomus shortly after defeating the \u201cBeggar-King\u201d Irus in Book 18 (18.150\u2013157). Odysseus is himself in disguise as beggar, and his words here help maintain that cover. According to the story he has told, he once was a great warrior, plundering faraway lands, until one day he was captured. On one level, his words here reinforce those lies. The fatalism and helplessness he expresses\u2014that a man only prospers while \u201cthe gods grant him power\u201d\u2014were frequently expressed sentiments of the Ancient Greek outlook, but they seem especially natural coming from a onetime king who has descended to the status of a beggar. Who better to comment on life\u2019s reversals than someone who has experienced them firsthand?\\nThe words have additional meaning, however, for both Amphinomus and Odysseus. For Amphinomus, they foreshadow death. He is plundering the land of others, living a careless life, much as the beggar once did, but he too is a feeble man, and he is destined for a fall. The words are a prophecy to Amphinomus, and a warning; he does not miss their meaning, as he walks away \u201cfraught with grave forebodings\u201d (18.176). For Odysseus, on the other hand, the words do not foretell the future but recount the past and, perhaps, explain the lesson it has taught him. At the hour of his greatest triumph, the beginn\n\nAnswer:",

Some scientists estimate that the oceans contain as much as 50 quadrillion tons (50 million billion tons) of dissolved solids.\\nIf the salt in the sea could be removed and spread evenly over the Earth's land surface it would form a layer more than 500 feet thick, about the height of a 40-story office building.\n\nAnswer:",

I NEED EXCERCISES, ENDURANCE, QUOTES. etc.\nAnswer: Here is some advice I previously posted to another 400m runner.\\n\\nIf you aren't already running 600m in your workout, add them once a week. They build up your strength and help you maintain your speed over that last 100m.  Not knowing your ability, I would say try to run them going out the first 400 at a pace 5-10 seconds slower than your best 400m and then concentrate on staying strong to the finish.\\n\\nI would also to workouts with multiple 400s, 5-10 seconds slower than your best 400 time, or multiple 200s, a second or two faster than your 400m pace.\\n\\nYou might also try running shorter intevals up a long hill. Back in the 60's, the UCLA team used to run 400s up a long hill. They had the best 4x400 team in the country back then, so the there is evidence that the workouts did some good. \\n\\nYou need to learn how to run the race correctly. I break the race down into 4 100s. For most of the first 100, you should be accelerating smoothly to your \"cruising pace\", running hard, but not sprinting all out. The 2nd and 3rd 100s, should be fast, but relaxed. The last 100 is where your strength will have to kick in. You are going to start to feel like someone dropped a weight on your back. We used to say \"The bear got him\" when we'd watch it happen to a runner in a big way.\\n \\nYou'll need to focus on keeping you knees going straight forward. They will want to go off at an angle.  Keep your arms swinging straight ahead. Some runners feel it helps them to exagerate their armswing as it helps keep their legs going.  \\n\\nRelax your face and jaw. Don't grimace. When you do, it thightens up first your face, then your neck and shoulders.\\n\\nAfter a hard run, do a lot of stretching. You've got to have a full range of motion to have a smooth, effortless stride.\\n\\nI always recommend Bob Anderson's stretching book, it's a classic: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0936070226/002-4340010-1751209&#92;\n\nAnswer:",

Any advice on how to help him deal with it? I just usually listen to what he has to say, but i dont ever know what to say to make things better for the moment.\nAnswer: The best thing you can do is just listen.  The fact that he is talking to you about this is a great complement to you indicating that the trusts you and feels that you will understand.\\n\\nIf he appears to be having problems dealing with these events or is having nightmares, stress, fears, etc then he should be evaluated for PTSD.  Do not assume that the has PTSD just because he was in Iraq but if he is showing signs of distress find a local 'Veteran's Outreach Center' and talk him into going there.  Here he can be evaluated by a psychologist experienced in Combat PTSD and he can get assistance if he needs it.\\n\\nIf he needs assistance but does not want to go to the vet center - at least have him email me.\n\nAnswer:",

Each entry is a message between users. There are fields like \"tousername\" and \"fromusername\" in the table. I'd like to set up a page that would list the current 'conversations' between the user viewing the page and the other users talking to him.\\n\\nSo assuming I select * from the table where the \"tousername\" equals the user viewing the page, since there are multiple messages to this user from the same person, if I just used a \"while()\" it would list each entry so every message would show up on this page. I'd like to find a way to select the data from the table but only once for each identical \"fromusername\", if that makes sense. So that way, each 'conversation' would only appear once on the page and you could see a list of users that you were currently having a conversation with, but without duplicate users because of each row in the table.\\n\\nThanks. :p\nAnswer: SELECT fromusername, tousername\\nFROM table\\nGROUP BY tousername, fromusername\\nHAVING fromusername = 'name of user'\\nAND status = 'open'\\n\\nAssuming you have a column, named status, that indicates which conversations are active. That will bring in only the unique pairs you describe.\\n\\nAs described earlier, you could also use DISTINCT:\\n\\nSELECT DISTINCT tousername, fromusername\\nFROM table\\nWHERE fromusername = 'name of user'\\nAND status = 'open'\\n\\nThe GROUP BY statement is computationally more efficient, but unless you are dealing with millions of records and thousands of concurrent requests, you shouldn't see a difference in performance.\n\nAnswer:",

People normally breathe in their chest. You can tell if you're using chest breathing because your shoulders rise and fall. With diaphragm breathing it is the stomach region that moves. Diaphragm breathing is a much deeper breathing than chest breathing. It is also quite difficult to achieve properly. \\n\\nTo manage it, you have to take a slow, deep breath, remembering not to move your chest. Do it standing or lying down; you have to make a conscious effort to get the air into your stomach (this doesn't really happen, but it feels like it. The reason diaphragmatic breathing gets more air into you is that the diaphragm muscle stretches the lungs so that most of them fill up with air. It helps to have a hand on your stomach, or to have someone watching you and telling you that you're moving your shoulders. You can also lie down and put a pile of books on your stomach, so that you can see whenever they rise or fall. When you breathe out, try to keep your stomach (and the books) up, by keeping the diaphragm tense.\\n\\nIt's quite difficult, but practice makes perfect. :)\\n\\nP.S.: \"Many Mockingbirds are actually mimicking Cell Phone ring-tones now.\"\\n\\nLol snagelfritz!!!

We don't do it here when a player is a free agent. What the story on this.\nAnswer: It's a system called \"posting\" that they initiated after the Dodgers signed Hideo Nomo after his \"retirement\" from Japanese baseball, and it was done to prevent MLB from poaching all the young Japanese talent.  MLB agreed to the provisions of the agreement because it keeps them from having to fight in court for the rights to Japanese players.  The NHL doesn't have any such system, which is why they could end up in the courts over players like Malkin, and that could cost them a lot of money.\\n\\nThe bid money goes to the Japanese team that owns the player's rights, assuming that the bidding team is able to sign the player within 30 days.  If they are unable to come to an agreement with the player, then the transfer fee is not paid.  So, if the Sox were unable to sign Matsuzaka, they wouldn't be out $50 million.  \\n\\nTo see a list of players who have been posted in the past, you can check out this link:\\n\\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posting_system\n\nAnswer:",

But to be a bit more specific, volleyball is a team game which can be played with 2 to 6 members on the court.  A ball is served from behind the service line (the back line of the rectangle on the floor) and the other team receives the ball.  They have three hits to get the ball back to the other side, where that team will have three hits to get the ball back over.   The goal is to hit the ball to the other side, inside the boundaries, and have it hit the floor. This is how you score a point.  \\n\\nThere are many techniques and hits that you will learn.  It's a lot of fun and good exercise!  Have fun and enjoy!\n\nAnswer:",

Kevin Jones (at Falcons) or Mike Bell (at Steelers)?\nQuestion: I'm flip-flopping on this one.  The other Broncos RB (Tatum Bell) might not play much.   The Steelers haven't exactly been dominant against the run this year.   \\n\\nThe Lions could fall behind early to the Falcons potent attack and then abandon the running game.  But Kevin Jones also scores fantasy points by catching the ball, too.  He has 37 receptions this season already. \\n\\nThe most well-reasoned answer wins.\nAnswer: Well, the question is not a hard one. Your facts are confusing you and that is why it is a hard question. No running back this year has gained over 100 yards against the steelers. NOBODY!\\nHere goes the breakdown for you:\\nweek 1: r. brown(mia) 15 rushes for 30 yards. . . long 8\\nweek 2: f. taylor(jax)   22  for 92. . . .long 25\\nweek 3: r. johnson(cincy)   19 for 47. . . . long 8\\nweek 4: LT(SD)   13 for 36. . . .long 12\\nweek 5: LJ(KC)   15 for 26. . . .long 8\\nweek 6: w. dunn(atl) 26 for 69. . . .long 9\\n              m. vick(atl) 5 for 40. . . .long 14\\nweek 7: j.fargas(oak) 18 for 55. . . .long 9\\n             l. jordan(oak) 7 for 21. . . .long 7\\nthe total for all of this. . . . .  46.2 yard avarage. GO FIGURE!!!\\nand these are your main backs for there respective teams, too.\\n\\nSooooo. . .like i was saying, it is not the question that has you confused, it is your facts. Here go the facts for you and you should not have a problem now making a decision. I have Tatum in my league and he is on the bench. I also have rudy johnson from cincy and he was on the bench. And here goes one more stat for you, Atlanta gives up 94.9 yards per game. \\n\\nSooooo. . . .who do you think you should start? How can you run against a defense designed for the run only? The different blitz schemes they run, and how well they cover the field. The Broncos wideouts are not that good so one on one coverage with the strong safety back will be all they need. they will bring 7 sometimes 8 in the box. The Steelers have giving up only 4 rushing touchdowns all season. 2 to Brown in week 1 but since then. . . one to Larry Johnson(wk5) and the other was Warrick Dunn(wk6). \\n\\nJust be smart. . . .Go to nfl.com and find out for yourself if you dont believe me, then you can come back and vote this answer as the best.\n\nAnswer:",

And whats the typical lifespan.?\nAnswer: Typically your machine should last anywhere from 3 to 5 years and possibly even beyond. I have a new PC, but I also use my old one and it's from 1999. It's got some quirks but it still runs pretty well. Old age will kill it eventually I know, but for the most part PCs should last a good long time. \\n\\nOne recommendation is to leave your computer running most of the time. You put more wear and tear on it by starting up and shutting it down than you do by just leaving it running, so if possible- just let it run.\\n\\nAlso after 3 or 4 years you're probably going to NEED a new machine anyhow, simply because there'll be a new version of Windows, new devices your computer can't accomodate, new software that can't run on older machines, etc.\\n\\nBut if you're just wondering how long you can expect your machine to run, I'd say if you take care of it, it could last at least 4 or 5 years and possibly more.\n\nAnswer:",

What did you say to them?\nQuestion: If you wanna join the army, but your parents wouldnt let you. What did you say to them?\nAnswer: Tell them you will get great training and it is a way to make a great life for yourself and a future for yourself and if you plan on getting married down the road a furture for that person also.  Being in the military takes a lot of pride and if it is something you want to do then you need to do it if your parents don't want you to.  When you graduate basic training and AIT they will be proud of you, then you will have accomplished something not everyone can do.\\n\\nMy husbands family didn't want him to join either, now they are very proud of the things he has accomplished, they even went to his graduation.\n\nAnswer:",

However, I'm trying to install Microsoft Expression Interactive Designer, and keep on getting told I need to install Windows Presentation Foundation version ... \\n\\nWhere can I find it?  I've installed WinFX Runtime components, Windows SDK and \"Orcas\" WinFX Development Tools .  What else do I need to get Expression Interactive Designer to install?\nAnswer: All the Graphic Designer actually requires to run is the EinFX runtime Components. Also available to further your programming experience is Expression Interactive Designer, Expression Graphic Designer, Visual Studio, Orcas, and the Windows SDK. The trick is that all the ctps must match. For example, Windows is currently releasing the May CTP for the Expression software packages. Therefore you must be sure that the May CTP for WinFX, Orcas, etc is also installed. If you have the March CTP for WinFX installed, you cannot install the May CTP  of Graphic Designer.\\n\\nYou can go to http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=4A96661C-05FD-430C-BB52-2BA86F02F595&displaylang=en to download the May CTP of WinFX Runtime Components. At the bottom of the page is links to other May CTP softwares. If you already have Visual Studio installed then you only need to worry about whether or not you want #1,2,4 or 5. Like I said before only the WinFX is required, but you may want to look into the other softwares too.\\n\\nI am currently using the May CTP of Expression Interactive Designer along with Orcas and the SDK. The SDK is a pain to install because it's a dvd img file, but it gives you a ton of great coding examples if that;s what you're looking for. If you do decide to install it, I suggest using VirtualPC to do so.\\n\\nIf you have more questions, I suggest going to http://www.microsoft.com/communities/newsgroups/en-us/default.aspx?dg=microsoft.public.expression.graphicdesigner&cat=&lang=en&cr=US which is a forum at Microsoft dedicated to teh Graphic Designer. Others may have already run into the same issues as you.\n\nAnswer:",

The problem is that I was not raised very religiously at all.  As an adult, I've done some research on several different religions.  However, my knowledge of any one religion is very superficial.  Each one seems to make sense on a certain level, yet seem so \"out there\" on another level.  I don't know if I'll ever be able to fully accept and participate in any religion.  But I feel like I need something to believe in.  I know that there is more to life that what we see.  I want to raise my children to believe in something.  I want some peace in this matter.  Has anyone else had this problem?\nAnswer: I had this same problem. I was raised Catholic, but very loosely. Religion did not play a major part in my life, but don't think I was ever really an atheist. I started looking into other religions such as different Christian denominations, Hinduism, Bhuddism, Zoroastrianism, Mormonism, Judaism, Sikhism, Shinto, Manicheism, Gnostic Christianity, Wicca and even simply deeper into my original Catholic upbringing. I found them all very interesting, and full of truths, but not complete. Then I looked into Islam and I converted after about a year or so of research  and study of the religion. It just seemed to be what I had already believed all along, for as long as I can remember. \\nI'm not saying that you should necesarilly become a Muslim now, but look into it. I would look into other religions on a deeper level and study them to see what makes the most sense and find what you believe (note I say \"believe\" and \"sense\" in the same sentence, not \"find very interesting\"). Until you find something, if you don't come to your own conclusions, just believ in God and do whatyou think is right; there isn't really much room for error there.\\nI hope you find what you are looking for.\n\nAnswer:",

What is that supposed to mean, Thanks in advance.\nAnswer: It refers to a point in a web page that can be referenced in a hyperlink. For instance, when you see a link that says \"Back to top.\" You click it, and your scroll bar takes you back to the top of the page. There is some anchor text (or at the very least, an anchor) at the top of the page. You use it like this:\\n\\n<!-- This is the anchor you want to return to. -->\\n<A ID=\"myanchor\">Anchor text</A>\\n\\n<!-- Code goes here -->\\n\\n<!-- This link takes you back to the anchor -->\\n<A HREF=\"#myanchor\">Return to anchor</A>\\n\\nYou can actually reference the ID attribute of any element (<DIV>, <H1>, etc.) as an anchor.

Can I conceive a healthy baby ?\nQuestion: When I have my periods, I have a good flow in 1 month and very little the next month. Why is this so ? I have heard that each ovary produces the ovum each month. Is something wrong with 1 ovary ? Can I conceive a healthy baby ? Please help me.\nAnswer: Your question tells me that you know very little about how your own body works.  Maybe I can help with that.  Your ovaries alternate ovum production.  One month it's the right ovary, the next month it's the left one.  The menstrual flow is no indicator of whether or not you can conceive.  I have no idea why your flows changes from one period to the next.  It just happens that way.  And I have no idea if you can conceive a baby, healthy or otherwise. \\n\\nYou also ask \"Is something wrong with 1 ovary?\"  Why would you think that???  If you are so concerned about this, and frankly I have read nothing so far that should cause concern, then you should see a fertility specialist but I think you'd do better to see your gynecologist and direct these questions to her/him.\n\nAnswer:",

And some people would sit there debating how to answer the question if people asked \"where did you go to school?\"  And they would come up with all these ways to dodge the question -- like \"I went to school in state X\" or whatnot.  I have found that if people say \"I went to school in Massachusetts\" then people just say \"oh, where\" and it drags on the conversation.  I think it's really arrogant to think you're so special you have to try to hide where you went.  If you went to Harvard and someone asks, then say \"Harvard\" and move on.  If you went to Yale, don't say \"Connecticut\" because that just invites follow up questions.  Just say \"Yale\" and move on.  I think it's worse and more arrogant to try to hide where you went than to just answer a question factually if people ask.  It REALLY annoys me when people feel they have to lie for some false humility's sake.  What do you think?\nAnswer: I agree.  I do not believe that anyone should be ashamed of anything.  You can not change the past and if you wanted to do it you should be proud or at least willing to accept the consequences of what you have done.  If you kill someone take the blame, if you went to an ivy league school take the looks.\n\nAnswer:",

They are usually called 'Bachelor of Medicine and Bachelor of Surgery', however at Southampton it's just called 'Bachelor of Medicine'. They are abbreviated to MB BS, MB ChB, MB, BM BS, MB BChir etc. All of these are the same, so don't get hung up on qualifications! Following graduating with our MB ChB (or whatever) we are called doctors. This is an honorary title, as we do not have a postgraduate doctoral degree such as a PhD. However, in some specialities it is necessary to have a postdoctoral degree. Most medical degrees in the UK lead to provisional registration with the General Medical Council. However, there are some private medical schools which don't, so be aware. Some medical students also leave university with extra qualifications such as BSc (Hons), BA (Hons) or BMedSci (see below). \\n\\nhttp://www.wanttobeadoctor.co.uk/main.php?page=4\n\nAnswer:",

It's not my primary residence.\\nIt's a $300,000 dollar property with $60,000 left on the mortgage. What would you do?\nAnswer: The mortgage is not relevant for taxes.  You need to know your tax basis in the property.  Normally, property received by inheritance is valued at the time of death to determine basis.  This means you should not have a capital gain.  You said the house is \"in trust\".  If this is true, neither you or your brother own the house, the trust does.  Your ability to \"cash out\" is determined by the terms of the trust and the decision of the trustee.  You need to consult and attorney who needs to read the trust documents.\n\nAnswer:",

I am wondering if I can expect 2 months, 6 months, 12 months? Anybody been there? Thanks.\nAnswer: For an otherwise healthy non obese adult, recovery time from a complete rupture often takes 6 months assuming the patient is motivated and compliant with the rehab program\n\nAnswer:",

Also, go ahead and make the Dr's appointment.  I would worry about the last period you had.  It sounds to me like maybe you really didn't have one.  Maybe you only had some spotting.  You may very well be getting to 8 weeks of pregnancy.  \\n\\nI am not a doctor so I can't be sure.  You can do an over the counter test.  Buy one that has two tests in it so you can take one tonight and then one on Thursday.  If you test positive, you will know.  If negative, you will know to retest on Thursday.  \\n\\nIf you period does not start by this weekend, you know that something is definitely wrong.  You will already have a doctor's appointment made for potentially next week and you will know soon what is going on with your body!\\n\\nGood luck!\n\nAnswer:",

Since the last email I sent, she did not respond and now refuses to respond to any attempt I make to contact her. She has always diapproved of anything and everything I do in my life, so it's probably better for me emotionally this way. My question is, how do I let go and be okay with this? I don't know what to do and I'm very confused. It's kinda like they say, if you hit yourself with a hammer every day for 30 years and then one day stop, you'd miss it. Well, she's been my mother for 31 years and has now decided to cut me out of her life completely. HOw do I get over this? Please help.\nAnswer: I don't know if there is a way to really get over it. She is your mom.  I do know how you feel.  My relationship with my mom has always been strained I always just let her say whatever and took it.  I eventually backed away and we didn't talk for a while. Then we slowly started talking again.  We still talk but don't have a close relationship.  I would give it some time and let her cool down.  Hopefully she will come around.  Hang in there.  But remember that even if she is your mom she shouldn't put you down and she should support you.  So even if you do have a relationship again with her don't rely on her for emotional support.\n\nAnswer:",

When you push on it do you feel pain? \\n\\nInformation on the appendix:\\n\\nThe appendix is a small finger-like pouch that protrudes from the large intestine. Appendicitis, which is most common in people ages 5 to 30, is generally caused by an obstruction that leads to inflammation of the appendix. There are no particular risk factors for appenditicis. It is not preventable, so early detection is very important. \\n .   Watch for signs of pain and/or tenderness in the navel area that moves towards the lower right of the abdomen over the course of a few hours. The pain is often described as severe and sharp and worsens with any movement.  \\n  \\n2.   Take your temperature - a low grade fever may be a sign of inflammation and infection, a possible sign of appendicitis.  \\n3.   Watch for signs of nausea, vomiting, or loss of appetite.  \\n  \\n4.   Call your health care provider if you exhibit any and/or all of these signs and symptoms.

As kids, we all went through our own private hells, because my dad had to work all the time. The bond between all of us is good, but I had grown to resent my mom, whom I didn't even know. I've only spoken to her a few times in my lifetime. This past Mother's Day, I called her because I heard she had just had a hysterectomy. We had a decent conversation. Some of my brothers still resent her and didn't call her. I think I'd like to forgive her, since we are all much older, now, and I'd like to release this burden, but not fully sure, yet. I was just wondering, what would YOU do in this situation? Would you forgive and forget or continue holding this grudge for her ruining your entire life?\nAnswer: You know forgiveness is a difficult thing.  I think if you are feeling it, you should do it.  It will be a lot easier to move on.  And really, how long does a person need to be punished for something wrong they have done?  I am not spiritual at all or even religious.  But a lot of people believe we will answer to a greater power once we leave this earth.  If you believe that, then there is no good reason why you need to carry around animosity for your mom.  You are an adult now and if she doesn't feel sorry now, she never will.  But I am sure she feels guilty and that is a punishment she will live with until death and then she will deal with whatever, after.  I think it takes a big person to forgive someone of such a huge thing as a mom leaving her babies.  My dad left my mom before I was born and then claimed I wasn't his.  It was a huge court battle and it was finally discovered he is in fact my biological father.  At age 18 he decided he wanted me back in his life.  I couldn't do it.  I wasn't ready.  I am a mother now and I have forgiven him and moved on.  He is now dying of liver failure and wishes he had more time with me...I am his only daughter.  So, he is being punished.  But not by me...but by himself and knowing that he did wrong.  Good luck to you.  You will make the decision best for you.\n\nAnswer:",

If your whole semester is only 100 points possible, then the highest you could possibly score, assuming that you were perfect on everything else, would be a 60.  If you finished with an 86% average on 100 points (not counting this assignment), then you would drop to a 46.  Which, is an F on most point scales.  \\n\\nIf your whole semester is worth a thousand points, then you could still have a 96% in the class, assuming everything else was at 100%.\\n\\nIf you have 1000 points and you continue on the 86% average, then it could lower your score to an 82%.  On a 1000 point assumption, it would drop your score 4%.\\n\\nWithout knowing how many points you have thus far out of how many possible, we can't tell you how much it will drop your grade.  Without knowing how many points your class will end up with, we can't tell you how much it will effect your grade at the end of the year.  Anyone who says otherwise is full of it.\n\nAnswer:",

It always has the same face pointing towards to earth.\\n\\nThere are a few reasons why it isn't practical to use it as a satellite. As has been mentioned above it is expensive to get there, and it is far enough away to have a significant delay in transmission.\\n\\nApart from that, there is another reason. When we deploy satellites we generally want to have extremely precise orbits. We may want a geostationary orbit, so the satellite is always in the same position relative to the earth, or we may want a satellite that covers the whole earth at one time or another. With the moon we have absolutely no control over its orbit, so unless you're lucky enough to have it in exactly the right orbit for you (highly unlikely), it's pretty useless.\n\nAnswer:",

I have lived here in the area my whole life and wouldn't trade it for the world. I have traveled all over the country and visited other cities of similar size and I think Springfield is the best. The streets are easy to understand and get around on, the traffic is never that bad. The shopping is pretty decent here and if you want more then Branson is only half an hour away. Or drive to KC, it's only about 2.5 hours away. I don't know if you are familiar with the area but the weather is variable. One day its cold the next its super hot. But its kinda nice that way. We have 4 beautiful seasons and lots of outdoor activities here.  We have several colleges but the population is diverse, its not all kids. Restaurants here are good, lots of choices. Springfield is the birthplace of Cashew Chicken and I think we have like a couple hundred Chinese restaurants. There is one on about every corner.  =)  Springfield is also the home of Brad Pitt and his family if that interests you at all. Though he doesn't visit as much as he used to now that he is with Angelina. =)  If you have any more specific questions or are interested in a certain neighborhood I would be happy to give you my opinion if you send me a message.

She and I have known each other since high school.  When I left my husband, hers left her around the same time.  For finacial reasons, and moral support, we moved in together with our daughters, who are about a year apart in age.\\n\\nRecently, my friend's ex has decided (for custody issues) that she and I are a couple.  While I have many gay friends and have very short hair, I am in no way a lesbian.  He is planning on citing me in the custody case as a reason that his daughter should not be with her mother (There are many other issues, but this is the one that pertains to me specifically).\\n\\nMy question is: Can I take him to court for slandering my name?  and if not, how can I get this guy to stop?  My daughter and my roommate's daughter both hear this crap come from his mouth every weekend when he brings them back from their separate father-daughter weekends. And I'm sick of it.\\n\\nAny suggestions?\nAnswer: There is one barrier that makes slander cases difficult. A 'well-known' attorney explained this to me a few years ago... you have to prove malicious intent.\\n\\nAs was explained to me, someone making false, negative statements about you isn't enough for a slander case. First there has to be harm done - there was in this case, there has to be some sort of loss - this could be as simple as loss of reputation and last, the offender must have been purposely trying to harm you (malicious intent).\\n\\nMalicious intent is supposedly the hardest part to prove.\\n\\nI would say that in your case, you would have a rather easy time proving malicious intent because the offender has a clear motivate to attempt to smear your reputation.\\n\\nBtw, most attorneys require a large 'down payment' for slander cases... anywhere from 5 to 10k.\n\nAnswer:",

So if you could just put your car and job it would be a great help.\\nThanks\nAnswer: Well, I'm currently a high school student, and I have a 1997 Acura Integra GS-R, which I bought from my life savings so far and money I've earned from numerous summer jobs. From what I've noticed with my experiences with people, this statement can and cannot be true.\\n\\nFor example, you can have a surgeon making like $150,000 a year and he's driving an old Honda Civic just because he wants to save his money for other things. You can also have a pizza delivery guy or someone who has a low-paying job and they could be driving a $30,000 BMW, because that's what they've saved up for with all their work and just wanted the flashy car and didn't think about other things that they might need.\\n\\nBut, I'd say about like 75% of the time, you won't find a surgeon driving a Civic...and also you're more likely to find a guy with a low-paying job driving a fairly expensive car...especially if you live in NY! But that's not always true. Most of the time, the person's car reflects their job.\n\nAnswer:",

You must get in her head and have her thinking about you. You must make her feel comfortable with you. \\nListen and talk to her. Women love to talk! They feel closer to you if you listen and remember what you talked about. In a way, words are a form of intercourse for a woman because it's the only thing they have with which to establish trust with you. A woman will tell you exactly how and when she wants to be seduced if you just shut up and listen to her. \\nTake things slowly. Show her that you're patient; your ability to resist her will make her wonder if you're really interested, and will motivate her to show you that she's worth being interested in. \\nKiss with your eyes first. Women need to feel a connection with you. You begin this connection through your words and then your eyes. If you can keep her eyes on yours, and hypnotize her with your words, you are halfway there. \\nIncrease the physical intimacy. You have to be careful with this one. Don't be eager or aggressive. Begin touching a woman with simple hugs, pats on the back, etc. Then gradually increase it by bringing her in closer...kiss with your eyes! Then move on to simple kisses (pecks). Again, take it slow. \\nTalk about sex or sexy things. At some point, begin to talk about sex...not between the two of you, but general experiences you've had. Once you inject the topic of sex, it will be on their mind when they think about you. With women, it's all about familiarity and safety. Talking about the act makes them more comfortable with the act. \\nTell a woman you want her. Pick the right time, but be clear that you want her (not in a cheesy way ['I want you baby'] but in a tender way). She needs to know you want a time and place for the act. Gauge her reaction. If she is ready, then plan on setting up the situation for it to happen. \\nWhen it's the right time, always ask for permission ('Is this okay?') and be ready to back off at any time if she is not ready. \\nRespect a woman at all times. She is not a piece of meat but a human being with feelings. If you are out to 'get some,' then you are not seducing a woman. You are merely an animal in heat. \\nFind a good form of interaction, one that works best for you. If you need time to think about what you're going to say, maybe email or IM will work best for you, at least to start. \\n\\n\\n\\nTips \\nAlways listen. \\nTalk to her frequently. The best approach is email. It gives you direct access to her head because you can be as intimate as you want and she can mull your words while you are not around. \\nKiss with your eyes -- establish that eye to eye contact and you will begin the intimacy process. \\nThis method works with men too except they don't like to talk as much. \\nDon't be creepy -- staring at the wrong times, seeming overly eager, or airing out your relationship past on the first date are all examples of the wrong way to seduce a woman. Relax, take it slow and be yourself (unless, of course, you are creepy). \\nBuild a \"buzz\" around yourself -- Women put a lot of stock in what their friends think of prospective suitors. If you want to date a particular girl, demonstrate your good qualities (e.g., sense of humor, good taste, charitable nature) around her friends. \\nThink before you speak. \\nWarnings \\nAlways use protection. \\nNever, ever have sex if a woman does not want to. Don't pressure her to do anything she doesn't want to do. Never hit a woman. \\n\\n--------------------------\n\nAnswer:",

Isn't that a personal thing.  Why do \"gay\" people feel they have to \"come out of the closet?\", discuss their sex life, etc to the media?  Maybe all the \"straight\" people should start publicly speaking on their sex life?\nAnswer: You are so right - a person's sexual orientation should not matter.\\n\\nAs for coming out of the closet - most of the time the gays are simply doing the same thing that straights do all the time: talking about thier family and/or loved ones. When we are talking about media stars - it seems the public has an interest in who is dating/marrying who, etc. Should they only ask those questions to straights? Should gays have to lie when asked these questions?\\n\\nStop and think about a typical Monday conversation - talking about what you did over the weekend and usually who you did it with. How it is somehow wrong for a gay man to say that he and his partner went out to dinner and a movie Saturday night but ok for a straight man to say he and his wife did? Do you want the gay man to lie and say he and his \"roommate\" went so that you will feel more comfortable?  \\n\\nIt's not like being gay is only about sex - like everyone else - sex is only about 10% of a person/relationship. I'd rather focus in on the other 90% of a person.  I just don't get what all the fuss is about - being gay is not contagious.\n\nAnswer:",

Each mineral is composed of a specific molecular compound, and those molecules arrange themselves in an ordered fashion based on their structure that will form a crystal.  \\n\\nThese regular and repeating groups of molecules and atoms form a unit that is known as a lattice. There are 14 lattice groups (Bravais lattices), which fall into six (some crystallographers use seven) different crystal systems. Each crystal system includes the different rotation and reflection symmetries around a fixed lattice point. \\n\\nTo make this all more confusing, and to the horror of most mineralogy students there are also 32 different crystal classes. Each crystal class is a different and unique set of symmetrical forms.\\n\\nTo see illustrations of Bravais Lattices go here:\\nhttp://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/solids/bravais.html\\n\\nFor a more detailed explanation go here:\\nhttp://dave.ucsc.edu/myrtreia/crystal.html#INTRO\n\nAnswer:",

Yet, for the sake of debate, which of the following choices proves most logical:\\n\\n1) All in nature existed eternally\\n\\n2) Something in the natural existance is the source of all that ever existed in the natural, (including by evolution)\\n\\n3) Something beyond nature, and with NO intelligence, is the source of all in nature\\n\\n4) Something beyond nature, and with intelligence, is the source of all in nature\\n\\n5) Some other conclusion, (although no other conclusion can be formed without some sort of redundancy).\\n\\nPlease, explain your logic and reason for your conclusion. Logic and reasoning is key.\\n\\nThank you for all and any answers.\nAnswer: An interesting question.  \\n\\n#1 would seem at first glance to be automatically false, as everyone will agree that there is evidence that there was a time when the things we see today in nature, did not exist.  But to get a little deeper, what if these things are the natural products of natural laws that have always existed?  E.g. what if our universe is just one of an endless series of universes that appear, unfold under natural laws that have been in existence for eternity, and then disappear, only to get reborn again as a new universe?\\n\\n#2 is the *goal* of a scientific explanation.  I.e. to see how much we can explain by the discovery of natural laws.  Science has no way of knowing if such an explanation will always be possible, but it has to try.  And so far we have done remarkably well ... almost everything we see in nature can be explained in terms of the operation of natural laws.  And natural laws can often be shown to derivable from simpler natural laws.  (E.g., that's why physicists are on a quest to unify the four forces of physics ... so that all laws of atomic physics can be derived from a single law.)  However, scientists will always be faced with the question of where these simplest of natural laws came from.  And they may have to settle for the answer \"they seem to have always been there\", which brings us back to #1.\\n\\n#3, and #4 need more definitions to distinguish them.  What do you mean by phrases like \"beyond nature\", and \"intelligence.\"  \\n\\nHOWEVER, despite being a died-in-the-wool evolutionist, I lean towards #4, (an intelligent, supernatural origin for all things in nature) but not with in the same sense as Intelligent Design.  I *don't* believe some intelligence designed every cell membrane, every flagellum, every eyeball, every bird, bat, or insect wing, every endochrine cycle, etc.  Evolution provides a far more satisfactory explanation for all those things based on such simple natural laws as the law of natural selection.  \\n\\nBut I do wonder where that force of natural selection, as a natural law, came from.   I believe it will be shown to be derivable from simpler laws of chemistry and thermodynamics, which can be derived from even simpler laws of physics.  But ultimately, we will still be faced with wondering where those primary laws of physics came from.\n\nAnswer:",

First, you figure out how many of each letter grade you have and multiply how much you have by the number it's worth.  For example, if you have 5 A's and 2 B's you take 4*5 A's, and add that product to 3* 2 B's.   See what I mean?  Once you figure out the grand total, you divide that number by how many classes you're taking and getting credit for.  I hope I helped!\n\nAnswer:",

Would you say im anorexic?  My friends tell me im anorexic.?\nQuestion: My ribs don't show or anything but am i anorexic?\nAnswer: Check this height/weight chart. This is a guideline... keep in mind that there are always exceptions, but if you find that you are out of the range you may want to consider that you might be underweight.\\n\\nAlso ask yourself...  Do you hate to eat? Do you eat ice cream? Potato chips? Pizza? Anorexia is more than just being skinny. It is a way that people relate to food and eating. If you eat when you are hungry and don't worry about it, I would say you are just naturally skinny.\\n\\nWhen you start refusing to eat certain foods because they have too much fat, when you look at yourself in the mirror and think you look fat all the time, when you obsess about your figure... those are danger signs. If you don't really think about what you are eating, and don't ignore your hunger, you are probably just skinny.\\n\\nIts ok to be skinny unless you get there through unhealthy means.\\n\\nAnorexia - losing weight through not eating, \\nand\\nBulemia - throwing up after you eat\\nare both unhealthy. If you think you have one of these tell your doctor. These can have severe consequences including interefering with your ability to have children later.\n\nAnswer:",

Some people you may feel comfortable telling much sooner than others.  Some people you may not feel it's a good idea to tell at all.\\n\\nI would say the point that's the \"right\" time is one of two times:\\n\\n1)  When you know that the person you're telling will accept and care for you because of who you are and that means they'll accept you for being gay, too... and you want to be open with them about who you are inside; or\\n\\n2)  When it hurts you so much to hide yourself that being rejected for who you are is less painful about hiding who you are from people.\\n\\nThose are generally the times you're going to come out to someone... \\n\\nIn any case, I hope if you're asking this for personal reasons, it works out and you don't get hurt by anyone for just being the person you are.  =)\n\nAnswer:",

I am pretty sure I will get PTI, but do I need legal representation at court if the PTI is not approved yet?  Anyone have advice to give?\nAnswer: At least consult with an attorney.  You may have made erros on the PTI application that could prevent you being eligible.  An attorney might be able to negotiate a favorabel plea bargain for you.

I love her more than anything, she's the most incredible person I could ever imagine. She's ready to leave me because she can't trust me. She has been cheated on and hurt in the past, so it's a little hard for her to trust to start with. \\nProblem is, I cheated on my last girlfriend. I have not and never will again. I learned that lesson. I lied about the cheating to the new girlfriend, a few times. I also spent some time with my ex talking about our breakup, but I didn't tell the new girl about it. She's really upset and hurt, and has every right to be. I've been dishonest with her.\\nI know that I'm going to be faithful and honest from now on. How can I get her to trust me again?\nAnswer: Unfortunately, some peoples trust can never be regained. Don't lie, always tell the truth, you will get in less trouble if you tell the truth instead of a lie. Talk to the new girl that your with, say your sorry, and explain. tell her you realize that she might not trust you now but i am willing to work on it. You mean so much to me and i would hate to lose you over my stupid(yeah,say stupid)mistakes. Good Luck:) I hope this helps. If not Sorry.\n\nAnswer:",

People who obsess about what they eat generally give up quickly. If you really want ice cream, have ice cream. Not \"once a week\". Just when you REALLY want it. But before you choose a high-calorie, low-nutrition food, think about it.\\n\\n1. You should be eating six small meals a day - not three large ones. Even if you arn't really hungry, sit down and eat a small meal. Eat at 8, 10, 12, 3, 6 and 8. And if you want to snack between, and don't think you can wait, go ahead. And I fully endorse a bed-time snack.\\n\\n2. When you eat, eat foods that will keep you full. ie: whole grains.\\n\\n3. If you want that snack in-between, but arn't sure you need it, drink an 8 oz glass of water or juice or tea and wait 15 min. If you still want a snack, have one. Often, you'll find that your body was saying \"drink\" and you heard \"eat\".\\n\\n4. Consider a healthier alternative. That's healthier - not low-fat. If you want strawberry ice cream, no amount of non-fat strawberry yogurt is going to help. But a rich, creamy Dannon Fruit-on-the-Bottom might just satisfy that craving. (or two- those cups are small) And since it provides the nutrients your body wants, it just may keep you from craving more, especially if you add some whole grain cereal on the top, or pair it with some whole-wheat toast or a granola bar.\n\nAnswer:",

Almost all of the people I know don't know. I've tried to deny this, and cover it up. I have even pierced my left ear twice. My brother and a lot of my friends are always making fun of gay people, and when I had my gay friend come over to our house, he (my brother) could barely contain himself. I don't think I can live with myself if I keep this all hidden from the world. WHAT SHOULD I DO?!\nAnswer: This is really a decision only you can make, no matter how much advice you receive from all of us.\\n\\nHaving said that, this is a little of my story to help you out.\\n\\nI am from a very strict Catholic family, my father was a cop, my brother is a security guard and at the time I was working in Federal Government Security as well. Basically Law Enforcement down the line. All very strict, uptight and all that cr@p. Lots of derogatory talk about gays and lots of gay jokes all the time and all the while I was sinking further and further into my dark little closet.\\n\\nOn the outside I was this wonderful, cheery, jolly bloke, the life of every party - on the inside I just wanted to take my service revolver and blow my head off to stop the pain.\\n\\nI ended up \"coming out\" and do you know what happened? Nothing! Big anti-climax! The world didn't stop turning, I didn't get dis-owned, Mum gave me a hug and a kiss and told me she would always love me no matter what. Dad gave me a hug but had a tear in his eye, and my brother, who I thought would just punch my lights out, gave me the biggest hug and said I never thought you would have the balls to do it. When I asked him what he meant he told me that he had always known he just never said anything.\\n\\nIt is your decision to come out, only you know when, where, how and to whom first. Good luck and God Bless.\n\nAnswer:",

She's pissed and said it's over. How should I handle this?\nQuestion: Things went sour and we ended sleeping in separate rooms. Things started getting better and she's asked me to sleep in her room for the last three nights. But what happened was that in the morning she couldn't find her keys so I told her to go ahead I'll come straight home after work. That evening around 7pm she called me and said she's going out and may stay at a friend's house. I told her I'm going out and to call me when she's on her way home. \\nAround 8:30pm I called her but she didn't pick up. I went to my friend's house and around 1am we went to his sister's house. I put my phone on the car charger. We got to his sister's house and I forgot my phone in the car. \\n\\nI got back to my car around 3am and I saw she called about 20 times. \\nI called her and basically she said it's over and she can't trust me. She said she was going to put my clothes out. But I went by that night to take a look and she didn't do it. I'm concerned that my hard work went down the drain and she's serious.\nAnswer: Do both of you want this relationship to work?  Sit down and have a long chat, the \"lockout\" incident is just the tip of the iceberg!  Your problems are more than that, perhaps the two of you do not really have trust on each other.  You better think carefully if you still want to be together since TRUST is a foundation of any relationship!\n\nAnswer:",

But there have been conflicts saying that it is wrong and that we came from adam and eve. And so many schools aren't permitted to teach evolution through these religious arguments between christianity and science.\nAnswer: Evolution is almost a proven fact.  In fact it's one of the basic concept of biological science. In fact humans have been tinkering with evolution for thousands of years.  Why do you think we have so many breeds of dogs? If you take selective breeding far enough you could \"create\" a totally new species. Germs and viruses are constantly evolving. Do you think the AIDS virus was spontaneously created by God?? It evolved from closely related chimpanzee virus that we can no longer be infected with. But the AIDS virus evolved from this virus that we can no longer be infected with. \\n\\nEvolution is obvious when you look at rapidly reproducing living things such as germs and viruses.  It is not as obvious for a longer living things as process is so slow that it takes millions of years. But fossil evidence is overwhelming that evolution is how we came to be human beings. \\n\\nWe did not evolve from apes!  Apes are our distant cousins that branched off millions of years ago. We are related to chimps and gorillas, but think of it as very very distant cousins. I don't know the exact percentage, but humans and chimps share over 99% of the genes. It's that one percent that makes us human.  \\n\\nI don't belive in god, but existance in a supernatural beings does not mean evolution is wrong. I don't think belief in god and evolution has to be mutually exclusive. If god created life, then he/she/it also must have created evolution to go with it.\n\nAnswer:",

Koufax had a 12 year career.  The first 6 years were under .500 with an era well over 4 runs a game.  By todays standards that's actually okay.  Back in the 50's and 60's you were basically on your way out!!  Somewhere during the off season between 1960 and 1961 something happened.  What that was, who can tell.  It's like a light went off in his head and he suddenly learned how to pitch.  There is no denying the second half of his career but as you said many other pitchers have won more games.  I can give you a list of pitchers with close to 300 wins that are not in the HOF.  Baseball has many issues starting with Bonds right on down to a terrible playoff system.  The powers to be really need to sit down and take a long hard look at their position on matters that really count.  As for Koufax, we all know about his medical problems when he left the game.  That may have helped him more than anything else.  He was a very good pitcher who just happened to have 4 HOF seasons and then walked away from the game.  I'd say based on what we've seen over the past 20 years, yes, why not.  After all lesser players are in the HOF\n\nAnswer:",

If the frame successfully reaches the destination (receiver), the next frame is sent.  If the frame fails to be received at the destination, it is sent again.  This protocol was originally developed at the University of Hawaii for use with satellite communication systems in the Pacific.\\n\\nIn a wireless broadcast system or a half-duplex two-way link, Aloha works perfectly.  But as networks become more complex, for example in an Ethernet system involving multiple sources and destinations in which data travels many paths at once, trouble occurs because data frames collide (conflict).  The heavier the communications volume, the worse the collision problems become.  The result is degradation of system efficiency, because when two frames collide, the data contained in both frames is lost.\\n\\nTo minimize the number of collisions, thereby optimizing network efficiency and increasing the number of subscribers that can use a given network, a scheme called slotted Aloha was developed.  This system employs signals called beacons that are sent at precise intervals and tell each source when the channel is clear to send a frame.  Further improvement can be realized by a more sophisticated protocol called Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Detection (CSMA).\\n\\nIn 1070s, Norman Abram son and his colleagues at the University of Hawaii devised a new and elegant method to solve the channel allocation problem. Many researchers have extended their work since then. Although Abranson's work, called the Aloha System, used ground-based radio broadcasting, the basic idea is applicable to any system in which uncoordinated users are completing for the use of a single shared channel.\n\nAnswer:",

I need accurate information that would help him choose. \\nSpecifically, how do the side effects of these drugs compare?  and how\\ndoes their effectiveness against OCD compare?  I understand that you\\ndon't give medical advice; nevertheless I would appreciate pointers to\\nreliable information.\nAnswer: I don't know about Abilify, but I was once on Zyprexa, and the side effects it had on me were bizarre. I experienced a lock-jaw kind of reaction. I couldn't control my speech, kept biting my tongue, and couldn't get words out correctly.It was so bad I had to go to the emergency room. The doctors had never seen this reaction. It was the scariest thing I ever experienced. Apparently, this is a problem that can occur. We found the side effect listed in some medical data about the drug. It was called Articulation side effects. Anyway, be careful with any new drug, and always watch out for any unusual effects. Hope this helps.\n\nAnswer:",

This is necessary because calculus breeds bacteria, which attributes to periodontitis. If this condition advances it actually reduces the amount of bone in your upper and lower jaw. This will cause your teeth to become loose, and you may lose them. If a dentist recommends a dental scaling, it is best to have it done.\n\nAnswer:",

But I still kinda have feelings for him. but I can't decide if I should act on them.  My brother totally hates this guys and because I see my bro everyday this is a prob.  The guy is really nice and cute I just cant make up my mind. He also has a girl that he was dating until she moved to Japan.  Technecly they arn't going out but she still likes him and I am friends with her.  I think the guy likes me because he flirts with me alot.\nAnswer: I am currently and have been for the past 5 years been dating my best guy friend of 15 years, and all is great.  We just had a baby boy together 6 months ago, and nothing has changed between us at all.  We are still just as good of friends as we were all those years.\\n\\nI personally believe that if the person is the one that you are supposed to be with for the rest of your life, you shouldnt have to change one itsy bit about yourself.  And if you accept him for who he is and he accepts you for who you are...then go for it.  You stand a good chance.\\n\\nAlso I am a firm believer in fate, and soul mates.  I believe that you can meet, hang out with or even date your soul mate years before you are destined to be together.  So even though you have had a few go's at it in the past, it doesnt mean that it isnt right this time.  Maybe then just wasnt your time together.\\n\\nI say go for it and let fate decide where you stand.\n\nAnswer:",

Plugging these values into the formula gives us\\n\\n4 = k(2)\\n\\nTo solve for k we divide both sides by 2 which gives us\\n\\nk = 2.\\n\\nIt would also be correct to set up the variation to be\\n\\nx = k y\\n\\nIn this case, we do the same procedures to find k. Plug in the known values for x and y to get that k = 1/2. Unless you are told which one to solve for either are correct.

This internal pressure would be greater than the (very tiny) pressure outside the spacecraft.  And just like increasing the pressure inside a balloon by blowing into it causes it to expand, this increased pressure inside the spacecraft would, if there was a catastrophic failure of some kind, cause the space craft to explode rather than implode.  The exact opposite happens to submarines that are deep underwater.  If something happens to a submarine at depth, it will implode as the pressure of the water around it is greater than the pressure of the interior spaces.\n\nAnswer:",

You can put your other files on the EDD but Windows needs to run from your computer hard-drive.\\n\\nOn the basis that you're making a back up of everything...\\n\\nThe problem with doing this is that you can't easily copy files that are being used by your computer and with Windows running there will be several files that are in use.\\n\\nThere's a couple of things that you can do.  The first is to get a program that does everything for you.  A good one is Norton Ghost, not only will it make a complete back up but in future it will keep making backups - whenever files change or are added to your computer Ghost will copy them to your EDD, that way you always have a mirror of your computer hard-drive and you can forget about manually backing things up.\\n\\nThe other option is to not have Windows running but this means backing up using XCOPY straight from the command prompt in DOS and if you've got XP then you won't have DOS. In other words, this method works only with older versions of Windows.\\n\\nThere's a couple of articles here that may help - the first uses the DOS approach... http://www.csulb.edu/~murdock/xcopy.html and the second is a technical response... http://www.duxcw.com/digest/Howto/hd/cpyhd/index.html \\n\\nPersonally, I'd get Norton Ghost - pop it in your CD Drive and let it do all the work for you.

As far as I can tell (not very far, I'm a newbie), the rim and tire look fine, but the inner tube and the stem seem to have come apart from each other, which obviously leaves a nice big hole in the inner tube.\\n\\nI'm hoping to eventually use the bike as my main commuter vehicle, so I'm trying to figure out exactly what went wrong, and how not to run into this particular trouble again. My (stupid newbie) guess is that this indicates there was too much air in the tube... is that a good guess? Or can this flat happen for other reasons? Because the stem is on the inside of the wheel, I'm not sure the terrain would have anything to do with it.\\n\\nAs an added bonus question, since I'll be picking up a replacement soon, what sort of tubes do you recommend? And does rider weight have any bearing on the sort of tubes to buy?\\n\\nThanks in advance!\nAnswer: What it sounds like was that you didn't have enough air in the tube. When the pressure is too low, the tire & tube slide on the rim as you brake. The result is usually a cut in the valve stem or the valve stem can get completely cut away from the tube.  Rider weight does not affect the tube. If you're going to commute, go with a puncture or thorn resistant tube. It costs a little more, but is made from a heavier rubber and less prone to pinch flats & punctures. The \"slime\" filled tubes will usually stop small punctures but only make a mess when it comes to large punctures or cuts.\n\nAnswer:",

My cousin got her Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery in India. She has lost more than 65 lbs in 5 months and is very happy with the results. The price for obesity surgery is very less in India. My cousin just paid 25% of the cost she was quoted in America. She got her surgery from a company called Forerunners Healthcare.\\n\\nForerunners Healthcare is very famous in India. I read a lot about them in the Newspapers and magazines. I have read a lot of their patient stories also. They arrange financing for USA, Canadian, UK and other international patients who plan to have surgery abroad for low cost, as bariatric surgery and weight loss surgery is not covered by insurance. They also have photos pasted of their International patients. You can checkout their website. There are huge cost savings. As a doctor I personally believe that your Obesity surgery can be easily handled in India, as the quality of healthcare available In India is simply best in the world. The surgeons are USA/UK trained and facilities are 5 star.\\n\\nhttp://www.forerunnershealthcare.com\\nHope this helps.\n\nAnswer:",

But if you gotta do it and you are willing to stick to a strict diet - I guarantee you the cabbage soup diet will work!\\n\\nIt is a fad diet and though the diet is strict, you don't have to be hungry.\\n\\nI lost 12 pounds in 7 days.

It will clean out the system and it does work.  \\n\\nJust remember to hydrate yourself well and take a good multi-vitamin and you will be fine.\\n\\nI can only say this because I am living proof that it works in a pinch when you gotta shed weight fast (like for a special occasion or event.)\\n\\nThe downside - you will more than likely gain it back if you return to your old eating habits and don't exercise.  I have kept mine off for over 3 months.  I have found that it shrank my stomach and I just don't eat as much as I used to.  \\n\\nThere is a website that will give you all the info - the recipe for the soup, the daily diet (only 7 days) and links to chat rooms and other discussions from people who are on the diet.\\n\\nIt's not the best way to lose weight, but I understand about needing to lose weight fast and this diet does work - no doubt.\\n\\nIf you are interested in a management program to diet sensibly, you might try sparkpeople.com.

He is scheduled to pitch Sunday however, in his last rehab start he pitched very poorly. Which leads me to believe that he is not healthy. If that's the case he might need shoulder surgery which would put him back in the DL which will open up a spot in the rotation and they'll be able to bring back Jered.\\n\\nSecondly, his last 5 starts have been really good (only given up 3 earn runs or less) and had it not been for the bad defense he would have won a couple of more games. A perfect example is yesterdays game, he pitched a great game but his defense let him down at least 3 times in 1 game. \\n\\nNow if Colon is healthy they should consider trading Jeff so that they can open up a spot for Jered. However, most of the rumors circulating involve trading Santana which I think, they should not do because he is still young only 23 years old and has a lot of upside. Another thing the Angels should consider doing is moving Kevin Gregg down to the minors and putting Escobar in the bullpen he's just dominant out of the pen. And then they would be able to put Jered in Escobar's spot (for this season only as I think Escobar is a very good starting pitcher).\n\nAnswer:",

If not then it doesn't matter but what is important however, is one of the diving techniques that they use. This technique is called Liquid Breathing. Until not long ago, people thought that this was fictitious and was not possible but in fact it has been around for a lot longer than you might think!\\n\\nThe general type of liquid used by the US Navy and other Navies in the world generally have a perfluorocarbon type composition. The type of halide attached onto the molecule depends but it is either fluorine or bromine. However, the only problem associated with using bromine is that it is a very strong greenhouse gas but it could be regenerated through special filters and rebreathers.\\n\\nADVANTAGES\\n\\nIt  seems like an odd concept but:\\n\\n1- Due to its density, Liquivent (marketed name for liquid breathing liquid) can carry as much as 25 times as much oxygen than blood and it has enormous potential for patients with lung and breathing disorders. \\n\\n2- If fluid is taken into the lungs whilst diving, then the pressure in the body could match that of the pressure of the surrounding water. Thus breathing would be easier and lower concentrations would only be needed. \\n\\n3- Thus, this would also eliminate the need for decompression and its inherent problems i.e. nitrogen narcosis and the bends.\\n\\n4- A given volume of oxygen-saturated fluorocarbon contains 3 times as much oxygen as the same volume of air or whole blood.\\n\\n5- According to the movie \"The Abyss\", the deepest suit dive was to 4800ft which is equivalent to about 300atmospheres of pressure! Tests with mice have been done at pressures of up to 8000ft.\\n\\nHISTORY\\n\\nThis concept originated in the mid 60's when Dr Kylstra a physiologist realised that salt solutions could be saturated with oxygen at high pressures. However, after several experiments he concluded that this mixture becomes toxic due to the build up of carbon dioxide. Therefore, a new mixture that could be saturated with oxygen and get rid of carbon dioxide quickly and efficiently had to be thought of.\\n\\nAfter further experimentation in 1969, Dr Clark realised that oxygen and carbon dioxide were very soluble in fluorocarbon liquids like freon. Assuming the lungs could cope with this material, Dr Clark figured that these fluorocarbons could support respiration of animals.\\n\\nLater developments\\n\\nDuring later years, the techniques of liquid breathing were constantly refined and improved. The survival rate of all the tested animals in recent years has been very high, thanks mainly to improvements in carbon dioxide elimination. Current liquids used can dissolve over 65 ml of oxygen and 228 ml of carbon dioxide per 100 ml perfluorocarbon. By the early 1990s this procedure was developed:-\\n\\n   1. The animal was anesthetized with intravenous sodium thiopental.\\n   2. The animal was put on its back. A tube was placed down its airway, ready for the liquid breathing medium.\\n   3. A blood sample was taken. The temperature of the liquid was adjusted correspondingly. It was no longer necessary to make the animals hypothermic.\\n   4. The perfluorocarbon was instilled into the animal's lungs through the tube.\\n   5. A floor-mounted 3-litre reservoir was filled with the perfluorocarbon. The liquid was driven by a pump through a series of machines which warmed and oxygenated the liquid and took the carbon dioxide out of it. The liquid flowed through a tube into a 3-way pneumatic valve which directed flow to the animal. A computer controlled the inspiration (18 ml of fluid per second), pumping the liquid into the animal's lungs, then back out again to the reservoir, at a rate of about 6 complete respirations per minute.\\n   6. At the end of the test, the animal was tilted for about 15 seconds and the perfluorocarbon was allowed to drain from the lungs. This can be seen in the film The Abyss where Ensign Monk drain\n\nAnswer:",

The distance between bases was already established as 90 feet, which it remains to this day. Through trial and error, 90 feet had been settled upon as the optimal distance. 100 feet would have given too much advantage to the defense, and 80 feet too much to the offense. As athleticism has improved on both sides of the equation, 90 feet remains the appropriate balance between hitting and fielding, as it continues to provide frequent tests between the speed of a batter-runner and the throwing arm of a fielder.\\n\\nThe rules consist of twenty general guidelines to the rules of baseball. The organization for which the guidelines were drawn up was the early 1840s New York ball club called the Knickerbockers.\\n\\nMany of the rules, formalized by Alexander Cartwright on September 23, 1845, were derived from earlier sources, but their compilation by the Knickerbocker Club provided a basis for modern adult organized baseball, in contrast to the various schoolyard ball games that had been around for generations previous.\n\nAnswer:",

The total ROV system is comprised of the vehicle, which is connected to the control van and the operators on the surface by an umbilical cable, a handling system to control the cable dynamics, a launch system (such as the A-frame shown in the photo to the right) and associated power supplies. The umbilical carries the power and the command and control signals to the vehicle and the status and sensory data back to the operators topside. In many cases, the umbilical includes additional strength members to allow recovery of heavy devices or wreckage.\n\nAnswer:",

What branch pays the most on average?\nAnswer: They all pay the same basic pay.  I'm sure the special pay is different for each service.  You can check out the DFAS website, http://www.dod.mil/dfas/.  If you're concerned about your mortgage, you also get a little thing called BAH, Basic Allowance for Housing.  How much you receive is based on rank and duty location.  It's not based on where you live.  For instance, if you are stationed in a high cost area like Washington DC, you will receive more than someone stationed in Indianapolis.  You can check that out yourself, by choosing a service under military pay information.  Then select \"basic pay\" and then click \"current pay rates\".  You should then see a chart for current pay rates and also information about BAH.  Use the calculator to see how much you would get based on the zipcode.\n\nAnswer:",

As it's thrown outside, it starts to move faster (when things move in a circle, the things that are nearer the outside move faster than things near the center; you can see this if you have a \"old-fashioned\" record player by putting two coins on it, one near the center and one near the outer edge and trace how long it takes them to complete the lengths of their paths). So the circling water near the outer rim is moving very fast and experiences bigger forces (since the force is proportional to velocity). But the water near the middle is moving slower because it's being dragged along the bottom and so ends up slowing down much more. Since the water near the bottom is moving so slowly, it exhibits a much lower centrifugal force and so there is little to no centrifugal force near the bottom (or middle). This is why you have a whirlpool (vortex): the water near the top is pushed out more (since there's higher centrifugal force there) and the water near the bottom is hardly pushed outward at all (since there's lower centrifugal force near the bottom to push it out).\n\nAnswer:",

You are labeling yourself as a racist even if you don't mean to.  Everyone who sees you can see that you are white.  Why do you neeed a tattoo to say it again?  What you need to think about is why do you need to have the tatoo say that to feel that you are defining yourself to someone.  We all see races but if you see people for who they really are then you may not need that tattoo.  \\n\\nSince you said, \"I just like being who I am,\" Why do you like about being white?  What did you do besides be born white to merit being proud about it?  Think about that.  Try to be proud of what you have accomplished, not what you have been born with, because that is no accomplishment at all and nothing to be proud of.  The wiser you become the more you will see this.  \\n\\nAlso, go rent a fantastic movie that has a bit about racist tattoos: American History X.

Is there a way to turn it back to 32 bit so he can install software?\nQuestion: He is having trouble installing software because it is not compatible with the 64bit Windows XP and he does not know what to do.\nAnswer: Unfortunately, no. The problem is that 32 bit Windows has a subsystem called WOW (Windows on Windows) which emulates a 16 bit Windows environment. Many installation programs use a 16 bit header file which loads the install. 64 bit Windows has WOW32 which loads Win32 programs, but does not have the original (16 bit) WOW to load programs like that.\\n\\nI think users need to pressure Micro$oft to include WOW with 64 bit versions of Windows. The few good things about Windows has always been backwards compatibility- with 32 bit XP, you can run DOS programs dating back to the original IBM PC- so long as they behave and do not try to access the hardware directly.\\n\\nEDIT: A user above mentioned partitioning. That is certainly a possibility. Another is to get a program like VMWare or Virtual PC. With that, you can run a 32 bit version of Windows in a virtual PC window and since you are running a 64 bit version of windows with a cpu which supports 32 bit emulation, the performance hit should be minimal. In other words, you run a copy of Windows XP (or 98 or 2000) inside Windows XP 64 bit.\n\nAnswer:",

At high temperatures, Fe will fit into the orthoclase lattice.  As temperature drops, the lattice shrinks so that Fe no longer fits.  Fe diffuses out of the latice and accumulates along the planes between orthoclase crystal twins.  Along the way, it grabs O to produce Fe2O3.  If you look closely at pink granite, usually you will see that the pink grains are actually white and red striped.  Those grains are orthoclase crystals with exsolved hematite along twin planes.\\n\\nExsolution and diffusion of Fe from orthoclase can only occur at high temperature.  If the orthoclase cools too quickly for the Fe to diffuse out, it will remain in the orthoclase lattice, which will be distorted to accomodate the larger (larger than K) Fe ion.\\n\\nMaterial science is not boring.\n\nAnswer:",

It was founded by C N Annadurai as a breakaway faction from Dravidar Kazhagam, headed by Periyar. The party is currently headed by M Karunanidhi, the former Chief Minister of the state.\\n\\nThe movement was initially mooted as one that championed the cause of socially and economically disadvantaged sections of the society. It advocated concepts of rationality, self-respect and rejection of casteism and superstitious practices, prevalent in the Tamil society. Prominent members preached militant atheism. The movement was sympathetic to the claim that there were two separate races in India, the Aryans and Dravidians, and the movement claimed to represent the latter. In the early years of its militant struggle, it rejected any concept known to have its origins in the north. There also was a brief period, during which it idealized a separate Dravidian land, comprising the southern regions of India, and Tamil Eelam. The anti-Hindi agitation of 1965, forced the central government to abandon its efforts to stipulate Hindi as the only official language of the country. With the passage of time and a shift in the national political scenario towards coalition governments, however, DMK has adopted a more national outlook. DMK championed the cause of Tamil and used its national clout to make Government of India declare Tamil as classical language. In the enrichment of Tamil literature, the writers belonging to DMK had an important role, although it needs to be pointed out that their contributions have tended to be more of expressions of dissent and disgruntlement at what was perceived as social injustice and domination of certain communities, in the social sphere, and of the Northern parts of India, in the political sphere, and substitution of less often used Tamil words for borrowed-assimilated popular ones for administrative and oratorical purposes, in the linguistic sphere. The 'contributions' pertain to a short period of a few decades and hence their value will need to be evaluated meaningfully only after several more decades, and that only if the contributions evolve additional dimensions of the ethos of linguistic expression that can be compared to those of earlier eras that have truly enriched the Tamil linguistic and literary heritage in a distinct and ever-lasting manner that caters to the innermost spiritual and intellectual needs of not only the upper strata but also the common man in general. The contributions thus far have centered around the party's campaigns for realizing and maintaining political power at a regional (Tamilnadu) level and in central government.\\n\\nThe DMK is also sympathetic and formerly allied to the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam in Sri Lanka.\\n\\nThe DMK has split into the [[AIADMK] and the MDMK. Of this, the AIADMK is the strongest rival party.\n\nAnswer:",

He may give you an oral med to take.  Or if you prefer over-the-counter treatments like vaginal suppositories/creams, you can clear it up in a few days. There are a couple of different kinds; if one ingredient doesn't work, try a different one.  Also over-the-counter cortisone cream will relieve the itch. Stay clear of sweets, white \"carbs\" like bread and pasta, eat yogurt with acidophalus cultures included (kills yeast) or take the over-the-counter acidophalus capsules.  Wear natural-fiber, loose fitting clothing and cotton panties/bras.  You want to keep the areas as dry as possible.  You can apply cornstarch to soothe and dry the areas also.  Don't use harsh soaps; try a bath in tipid water with 1/2 cup of oatmeal in a wash cloth tied with a rubberband.  It's a great gentle cleanser and won't irritate your delicate skin.

I'm really worried about one of my friends she is saying she is fat when she is not. I insist on telling her she is fine the way she is and is beautiful but she thinks she is huge. She's told me she is on this diet that she only eats 800 calories a day. Is this true? is this healthy? will she lose weight? I don't want her to get hurt but she won't listen to me what can I do to help her!!!!!!\nAnswer: Yes, she will lose weight. And muscle tissue and brain functionality,strength and endurance. She is dangerously below what she needs in a day (usually 1200-1600 calories are recommended for those who are extremely overweight). Sounds like she may need to seek counseling because if she sees something different than what really exists when she looks in the mirror, then her mind's eye needs to be reprogrammed. These are often beginning signs of anorexia and bulimia. Encourage her to talk to a counselor. She is in danger of harming herself by doing these things. This is not the time to keep your thoughts to yourself. If necessary, ask for help from a trusted adult to intervene. She may get mad at you, but it's worth it to save her life. Be encouraged.\n\nAnswer:",

I broke my right leg (fibula) shattered my ankle and foot (if it wasn't because my leg had a pulse, they would've amputated it). It's been 6 months and I'm still in a lot of pain...I take Percocet 10/325 every 4hrs and sometimes it's not even enough. This makes me wonder if I'll ever be able to walk again (without crutches) and it makes me so sad. Has anybody been in a similar situation? How long did it take you to recover and how was the process? I would really appreciate it if you could help me understand my recovery better. Thank you so much.\nAnswer: speaking from experience..i broke my leg in 2 place and my wrist in 9 during the same accident.I was out of work for 6 months..i waited and rested as told but also kept stretching and flexing my foot and hand to keep things in motion. if you have had it immobilized for this entire time it will take some rehab.. you may also look at the possibility that your hooked on your pain meds. they will trick your brain into thinking your in pain just so you'll take more.

Being this is the second time that you have sprung the same ankle.  I would suggest an ankle brace one that you can lace up.  They are sold at many pharmacies and medical supply stores.  In the meantime, make sure that you exercise your ankle as much as possible to the point that it hurts then back off.  Moving your foot up and down.  As far as getting good with crutches.  A visual demonstration is always best, if you put the crutches ahead of you when walking possibly a foot then step into it.  Don't go beyond where the crutches are you could loose your balance.  The same for turning.  Going down stairs, put the crutches on the next step keeping your bad foot in front of you and then step down.  Going upstairs, again put the crutches in front of you keeping your bad foot behind you and hop up to the next step.\\n\\nI hope this helps.\n\nAnswer:",

The body of virtually all children produces an enzyme called lactase.  When they grow up, the body switches off the production of that enzyme.\\n\\nDue to a genetic mutation that occurred on chromosome 2 in the population of European humans, virtually everyone of European ancestry can tolerate lactose well into adulthood.  Africans descended from some tribes mostly can - while Africans descended from other tribes mostly cannot.\\n\\nThis is completely with respect to genetic ancestry, not where someone lives or is a citizen, of course.\\n\\nQuite a bit more information on this biological phenomenon is available in the Wikipedia.  I have included a link to a page that explains lactose intolerance in detail.\n\nAnswer:",

If so, how did you/they keep on working (getting cleaned up for work) and taking care of the family? Why does this seem to be happening?  When I see a homeless person I look at them and wonder and not judge because I KNOW how awful it is when bad things happen in a person's life out of their control.  Sometimes I just want to die because I'm tired of being afraid all the time.  It's not even just the fear of being homeless - it's other stuff too.  Can't go to doctor - no insurance and can't take time off work especially right now. There isn't any help for people unless they make very very little money.  Ours is not the case - we don't make a lot of money but at the same time, when things get this bad, there is not help because we make too much money.  Anyone else in this situation? No $$ to move either.\nAnswer: I've been there when my kids were young. I've been evicted because I didn't have a job or a way to pay the rent. I've also had to turn off the heat because I couldn't pay the bill. So you could see your breath in our home. I felt like a terrible mother.\\n\\nNow, many years later, I'm doing great and so are my kids. My experience motivated me to work on the board of directors for our local homelsss organization. We recently put up an apartment house for people who needed to get on their feet. It's free rent, free food, free job help, etc. People can stay for up to four months while they make progress toward getting on their feet, and we have the support of local government and businesses because they know it is a well-run program. \\n\\nWe also have a halfway house for people trying to get off alcohol and drugs. They must remain clean, they must sign in and out, they must attend AA meetings, etc. It has an 85% success rate. They can stay up to 18 months, but most people leave earlier because they successfully got off drugs and found a job an a place to live.\\n\\nWe also have a day center where people can take showers, do their laundry, store their belongings, get job counseling, have two free meals a day, etc. In the winter, our local churches open up to allow people to sleep in the community rooms, and we bus them there. No drugs or alcohol are allowed.\\n\\nI think more communities should be doing this. Too many people are just one paycheck away from the street, especially because today's businesses have no loyalty to their workers. You can be fired for no reason at all. Read the paperwork you sign when you take your job. It specifically says you can be let go with no warning and with no reason. I think that's absolutely shameful.\n\nAnswer:",

Since I've completely changed my ways, I even work with kids now (and no I don't molest them!), although I haven't turned myself in, because if I did I could never make up for the horrible things I did.\\n\\nIf you hate me, you should, because I've done terrible things, but know that I hate myself too, and that I've been to Hell and back and have never truly been happy since.\\n\\nAny questions you want to ask me?\nAnswer: How can you be a former pedophile. I can't imagine that a person would have those urges and suddenly they just go away. It's like saying I used to be a murderer. The urge to kill/molest never goes away. If you have gotten your urges under control it doesn't mean you aren't a pedophile - it just means you control your desire to touch children inappropriately.\\n\\nThe other thing I want to ask you is, how do you think you can make up for what you did? I was molested as a child and it still affects my life every day. You molested at least one child - I think your life should be judged by the pain you caused and how many you children your hurt. I think you need to suffer every single day what you did to each of those children causes them pain or alters their lives....\n\nAnswer:",

While Baptism should be strongly encouraged, because of the external witness it provides, it can by no means be considered salvific.  You are saved through faith, not by works, lest anyone should boast in themselves.  (Ephesians 2:8-9).\n\nAnswer:",

If you could explain this to me I'd be grateful.\nAnswer: First check your Napolean Complex before you reck yourself!  Your not exactly living la viva loca ... please get back on your meds ...\\n\\nAlthough often still discussed in contemporary American politics as representing the quintessential \"fringe\" end of the far-right spectrum, today the group only exists in the form of a number of very isolated, scattered \"supporters\" that probably do not number more than a few thousand. In a 2002 report on \"Extremism in America\", the Anti-Defamation League wrote \"Today, there is no such thing as the Ku Klux Klan. Fragmentation, decentralization and decline have continued unabated.\" However, they also noted that the \"need for justification runs deep in the disaffected and is unlikely to disappear, regardless of how low the Klan's fortunes eventually sink.\"\\n\\nToday the only known former member of the Klan to hold a Federal office in the United States is Senator Robert Byrd, who says he \"deeply regrets\" joining the Klan over half a century ago, when he was about 24 years old. There are currently no known members of the Klan who also hold a Federal office.\\n\\nSome of the larger KKK organizations currently in operation include:\\n\\n\u2022Church of the American Knights of the Ku Klux Klan \\n\\n\u2022Imperial Klans of America \\n\\n\u2022Knights of the White Kamelia \\n\\nThere is a vast number of smaller organizations. As of 2005, there were an estimated 3,000 Klan members, divided among 158 chapters of a variety of splinter organizations, about two-thirds of which were in former Confederate states. The other third are primarily in the Midwest region. \\n\\nThe ACLU has provided legal support to various factions of the KKK in defense of their First Amendment rights to hold public rallies, parades, and marches, and their right to field political candidates.\\n\\nIn a July 2005 incident, a Hispanic man's house was burned down in Hamilton, Ohio, after accusations that he sexually assaulted a nine-year-old white girl. Klan members in Klan robes showed up afterward to distribute pamphlets.\\n\\nSensitivity to the highly-charged topic of the KKK is in evidence at professional baseball games. Fans will sometimes post a letter \"K\" (the scoring symbol for strikeout) every time the home team pitcher strikes out a batter. Typically the letters will be spaced in such a way that no three consecutive K's are run together. Another approach is to have every third one be a backwards K, although a reversed K more typically denotes a strikeout in which the batter does not swing at the third strike.\n\nAnswer:",

And even then, the FDA's guidelines are overly cautious. The FDA has issued no consumption advice about the amount of fish that's safe for older kids, teens, men, post-menopausal women, and women who don't plan to become pregnant.\\nIn the FDA's own words, its mercury guideline \"was established to limit consumers' methyl mercury exposure to levels 10 times lower than the lowest levels associated with adverse effects.\" So even if a pregnant woman consumed twice as much mercury as the FDA's recommended limit, she would still be protected by a 500-percent cushion.\\nSo determine which category you are and eat accordingly. \\nThere is tuna consumption calculator but rough estimate is that it is safe to eat 2 ounces for 3 ponds of you weigh.\\nexample you weight 120 lbs \\nmultiply it by 2 and divided by 3 = 80 ounces of tuna per week almost 2 lbs.\n\nAnswer:",

Epidemiological studies estimate that that around 1% of the entire population likely meet criteria for bipolar. Yet, psychiatrist in particular seem to like to diagnose this disorder whenever they hear somebody has an elevated mood between bouts of depression or has signs of agitation during a depressive phase. These symptoms may be indicative of bipolar, but bipolar requires much more. As a psychologist at a major medical institution, I can tell you that in the past 5 years I've only seen maybe ten true cases of bipolar, but I've probably seen over 100 patients who were incorrectly diagnosed with this disorder. If you think you have bipolar or a psychiatrist diagnosed you with it, you should get a second opinion from a doctoral level psychologist (i.e., Ph.D. or Psy.D.). The other way bipolar tends to be over used is if somebody you know seems unreliable or overly emotional. Such symptoms do not necessarily indicate bipolar, but the media and untrained physicians will use this phrase almost as a colloquialism.\n\nAnswer:",

This may be asking a lot, but what is your financial strategy for a good steady level of growth?\nAnswer: That other answer is not entirely true.  CDs are not backed by the full afaith and credit of the US, they are backed by the FDIC.  That means if the bank fails, your deposit is safe.  Only US Treasuries are backed by the full faith and credit of the US government.\\n\\nYou need to figure out how long you plan on saving for.  If it really is one year, then stick with CDs.  If it's 10 years, you should look at high quality mutual funds that have a decent ten year track record (or longer) and are low cost.  \\n\\nYou may want to consider working with an advisor and put together a solid strategy.

The word hoplite (Greek \u1f41\u03c0\u03bb\u1f77\u03c4\u03b7\u03c2, hoplit\u0113s) derives from hoplon (\u1f45\u03c0\u03bb\u03bf\u03bd, plural hopla, \u1f45\u03c0\u03bb\u03b1) meaning an item of armour or equiment and consequently the entire equipment of the hoplite (but not specifically the circular shield, which is sometimes incorrectly referred to as a hoplon, though it was in fact called an aspis). These soldiers probably first appeared in the late 8th century BC. These were a citizen-militia, and so were armed as spearmen, which are relatively easy to equip and maintain; mainly they represented the middle class, who could afford the cost of the armaments. Almost all the famous men of ancient Greece, even the philosophers and playwrights, fought as hoplites at some point in their lives.\\n\\nHow did they fight?\\nSince the hoplites were a militia force and did not receive permanent wages, campaigns were short and mainly confined to the summer. Armies marched directly to their target. There the defenders could hide behind city walls, in which case the attackers generally had to content themselves with ravaging the countryside as siegecraft was undeveloped, or meet them on the field. Battles were usually set piece and intended to be decisive. Both forces lined up on a level field, usually in a rough phalanx formation around eight ranks deep (though this varied). Other troops were less important; cavalry generally protected the flanks, when present at all, and both light infantry and missile troops were negligible.\\n\\nWith what did they fight?\\nHoplites generally armed themselves immediately before battle, since the equipment was so heavy. Each man provided his own gear so it was fairly non-uniform, and often friendly troops would fail to recognise one another. A hoplite typically had a breastplate, a bronze helmet with cheekplates, as well as greaves and other armor, plus a bowl-shaped wooden shield called an aspis which was around 1 metre across. The primary weapon was a spear, around 2.7 metres in length; as this frequently broke upon charging and was unwieldy for close combat, hoplites also carried a smaller 60 cm thrusting sword called a xiphos. The total cost of the hoplon was roughly equivalent to a middle-sized car in our time.\n\nAnswer:",

I'd been walking briskly around the store before I used the machine.\\n\\nI was shocked by the numbers! My systolic pressure was elevated, and my diastolic was VERY elevated! I waited a few minutes, then did it again and both numbers were PERFECTLY NORMAL. I asked a pharmacist how accurate the machine was, because this seemed weird, especially since only a month ago, I had my BP taken by my doctor and it, too, was normal.\\n\\nThe pharmacist said to sit for another minute and take a THIRD reading, then go with whatever 2 out of the 3 readings indicated. I did that, and the third reading was also normal. I felt very good about that. However....\\n\\nI'm concerned whether my BP rises to dangerous levels when I'm exercising. It's great that it's normal and healthy when I'm sitting around doing nothing, but why was it so high, albeit TEMPORARILY, just from walking briskly in the store?\nAnswer: Physical exertion raises blood pressure, but if your bp has been normal, and returns to normal quickly after you return to rest you have nothing to worry about. If your resting bp is also high, then you have medical hypertension. In your case you sound like a healthy person, whose bp simply elevated to match your exertion. Any time you are physically active, your blood pressure should elevate to provide the needed oxygen, nutrients to the muscles. The muscles themselves help to increase circulation, thereby raising bp, by compressing veins during contraction, which forces the blood to return to the heart at a higher rate. Remember to get plenty of exercise, eat right, and have regular physicals......... Good luck, and I hope you remain healthy in the future.\n\nAnswer:",

I, however, do not have children.  But I was laid off in 2004 from my job as a Probation Officer.  (who would have thought they needed less P.O.s) I have been trying to get hired by the State of Georgia and Alabama as a Probation Officer ever since.  I have interviewed for at least 10 different positions, and so far it has been the same response.  \"We were very impressed with you, however, we chose another candidate.  Please continue to apply.\"  If they were so impressed, then why am I still working for peanuts at my current 'fill-in' job that pays $9,000 less per year than I was making?  Who knows.  One office has a female Chief, she refuses to hire women.  She hired a man that was a car washer and a tax preparer, over me, a qualified (both by College degree and 3.5 years experience) probation officer.  I have been so sick of the whole interview scene and depressed to boot.  But, I haven't given up.  I keep praying, and I know that God will lead me where I need to be.\\n\\nMy advise. Keep your head up and stay motivated and positive.  Eventually, an employer will see what a benefit you would be to his/her company, and you will get the job you deserve.\\n\\nGood luck!!\n\nAnswer:",

My husband seems 2 think that after he comes from overseas he will get a pier diem which is either $3.00 or $3.50 a day 4 his time over there. And he also thinks he is going to receive a clothing allowance for being active duty Army. I'm wondering if either of these are tru and if so how much is the clothing allowance and when should we expect to see either one?\nAnswer: Per Diem is given sometimes, like if you are on TAD (Army and Airforce call it TDY), or when you are transferring.  How much you get for it can vary.  Here's a website where you can look up the amount.  You can also get partial perdiem.  \\n\\nhttps://secureapp2.hqda.pentagon.mil/perdiem/perdiemrates.html\\n\\nYour orders will say if you are authorized perdiem.  \\n\\nClothing allowances vary by which Branch you are in, whether you are male or female, and in some cases what paygrade you are (Navy E7 -E9 get a different amount than Navy E1-E6).  The reason for the difference is because, obviously, the uniforms for the different branches (and different genders) cost different amounts, and it's meant to offset the replacement costs.\\n\\nThe 2006 paychart shows the clothing allowance for a male in the Army to be \\n\\n$1283.49 for the initial allowance (this is what they give them in bootcamp, but turn around and take right back, because they give them all the uniforms).  \\n\\n$356.40 for Basic Uniform Allowance or $511.20 for Standard Uniform Allowance.  \\n\\nUniform allowances are paid every year on the first payday after your anniversary in the military, except for the Navy, where when you make the rank of E7 it switches to the anniversary of your promotion to that paygrade, because you switch uniforms at that time, so they \"reset\" your annual countdown.  \\n\\nHere is a website that should be able to explain what pay and allowances he should be getting, under what circumstances he will be able to get it, and how much it should be.\\n\\nhttp://www.dod.mil/dfas/\\n\\nHope this helps.\n\nAnswer:",

From this point of view they would not have faith, for faith is belief without evidence.\\n\\nso, it seems that agnostics are the ones with faith, while the thesist (christians etc...) are the one without faith. maybe that explains the many problems with todays religions.\nAnswer: I think you may have your terms a little off.  \\n\\nAn agnostic is someone who feels that the belief in a diety cannot be proven therefore his or her own belief is one of ambivalence. They don't necessarily have faith, but they don't necessarily deny God's existence either.  They are simply saying they don't know.  \\n\\nA person who has a belief in a diety, but feeling the existence of that diety, or it's characteristics is unknowable would be a mystic.\n\nAnswer:",

However, I haven't been able to really put my finger on why.  Of course, what's not to like about animes, mangas, and fics with lots of hot, steamy sex?  But I mean the yaoi and slash genres in particular.  I know the fandom for these genres is largely young adult women.  Any theories why?\nAnswer: Yes, several - I'm not sure if any of them is \"right\", though.\\n\\nSome friends have suggested to me that it could be something similar to straight males liking lesbian porn - you get to read or write about two characters you like going at it without any women, who a large proportion of the fandom will not be attracted to, involved to get in the way. However, that still wouldn't explain why I like it, since I'm more attracted to other women than I am to men.\\n\\nIt could partly be the novelty of it - male/male sex and relationships are things that a woman cannot experience in real life so fanfiction could be a good way to explore these things if you're curious about them but don't want to do anything drastic.\\n\\nIn fandom for some animes/mangas/etc. it could also be partly due to the lack of interesting female characters; if the women aren't interesting in canon you're not going to find them interesting when you read about them in a fic, no matter what they're doing with each other or with the male characters.\\n\\nA male/male relationship could also seem more equal, and with a same-sex relationship a woman might feel like there was more freedom for the characters not to behave in the way they would be expected to if they were in a relationship with a female (if that makes sense). In a straight relationship there are roles which each person is kind of expected to take based on their sex (maybe not so much in real life, but in things like movies and TV shows), slash may make it easier for a woman to write about or imagine the characters in a relationship without using these roles.\n\nAnswer:",

Or police, truckers, and EMT signals?\nAnswer: Different reasons -- \\n\\n1.  Frequency separation.  Radio stations operate on different channels (frequencies) than CB radios for example.\\n\\n2.  Different locations.  You can operate on the same frequencies if the transmitters are located far enough away from each other.  Look how many \"Channel 3\" TV stations there are.  They're far enough away from each other so they don't interfere.\\n\\n3.  Different modulation.  FM and AM are types of modulation.  In the case of radio, they're also on different spectrums, but you could have the same frequency modulated differently and have minimal interference.\\n\\n4.  Digital transmission.  You can transmit information digitally over the airwaves and \"multiplex\" it such that it doesn't interfere with other transmissions (cell phones for example).\n\nAnswer:",

Most of the clubs do their recruiting either at the beginning or the end of the semester. See if there are any clubs that are doing anything that you might remotely be interested in. If you know someone who's in a club, asking about the club's activities might be a way to start a friendly conversation. \\n\\nThere are also the usual extra-curricular activities and sports available. When I went off to school, I joined the band and enjoyed it...I got good at it, and ended up going to college for free on music scholarships, so getting involved in an activity can actually be beneficial in more ways than you initially realize. \\n\\nIf there are any opportunities to volunteer around the school, do so. I still use this tactic from time to time when I'm in a new situation and need to meet people. While doing the volunteer activity, you can make small talk with whoever's standing next to you, even if it's something goofy like, \"Hey, I like that shirt you're wearing.\" (However, clothing compliments can only go so far if you're at a school that uses uniforms). \\n\\nThe only real answer is to get involved. Even if you're shy at first, you must get involved. If all else fails, just admit to a teacher that you're having a bit of a hard time adjusting socially. They'll usually be glad to help you hook up with some kind of activity.\n\nAnswer:",

You need to think of yourself as a needle or torpedo in the water.  You want the least resistance as possible so staying straight will make you go faster.  You want to kick from your hips and point your toes.  I used to have a large sissors kick and it only slowed me down.  Other swimmers kept pointing this out to me and I concetrated on keeping my legs together.  You can feel your thighs rub together and let your big toes touch each other each time you kick.  Now that I don't have a big sissors kick and I'm more streamlined I can swim 20 seconds faster for 250 yards.\n\nAnswer:",

We have been closing our gates for the last couple of weeks to keep her vicious dog out so that our grandchildren can play in the yard without fear of getting bitten.   The neighbor will come right behind us everytime we close the gate and open it back up yelling and cussing saying it's her land and we cannot close the gates.  What kind of action can I take against this woman?  I cannot sleepl, eat or have peace of mind for fear of her hurting me or my family.\nAnswer: First you really need to make sure that the gates are on your land and that both your Deed and hers do not contain any type of easement, right of ingress or egress, covenant blah blah that entitles her to do this.  Don't assume anything. You probably have your Deed in your files, and you can look at hers for free at the clerk or recorders office.  Many people are amazed to find that their Deed does have one of the above.  \\n\\nOnce you are certain she does not have this right, you can file a complaint in Municipal Court against her.  Chain and padlock the gate while you wait for your court date.  If she keeps it up after you go to court and win, you can probably have her arrested.  At the very least, the police will have to deal with her because you will have an order or decision.  If she gets herself arrested, and she is truly \"mentally ill\" as you say, there is a chance that she will be remanded for observation.\\n\\n\"We have called the police, 911 and the local dhhr and the humane society and NO ONE will do anything.\"   \\n\\nOf course not. The police don't settle Deed issues, she hasn't done anything crazy enough for dhhr to get involved, and the dog hasn't been ruled vicious.  You are going about this all the wrong way, and all you are doing is frustrating yourself.  You are asking people to do things that are not in their power to do.\\n\\nYou need to first check the Deeds and proceed with a complaint filed in Municipal Court against her if you are truly in the right as per your Deeds. Anything less is just going to generate more frustration on your part.\n\nAnswer:",

This might just be my friends and I, but when I'm with my girfriends, I know that I'm never without protection. We'll be in two adjacent stalls and I'll yell, \"Damnit! Throw me a tampon!\" And two seconds later, a little tube slides under the door. I don't think I could do that with a stranger.\\n-Because we've been doing it since we were potty-trained and don't know any better.\\n\\nJust my theories. I don't really think there's a real explanation.\n\nAnswer:",

And why do they hate Americans so much?\nAnswer: Before 1953, Iran was a secular democracy and radical islam was a minor phenomenon.  In 1953, the US helped the Shah overthrow and destroy the Iranian democracy, creating a brutal dictatorship that benefited the US at the expense of the Iranian people.  \\n\\nThis anti-democratic act by the US polarized Iranians.  Since attempts at peaceful democratic opposition were brutally repressed, violent and radical islamic theology became the only force strong enough to oppose it, much the same way countries turned to communism wherever the US supported fascist regimes (Batista in Cuba, Somoza in Nicaragua and Pinochet in Chile, etc.).\\n\\nIn the end, US support for the Shah ended up funding terrorism against the US for 20+ years.  To help the Shah, the US gave him printing presses, plates, paper and ink to produce US $100 bills.  After the fall of the Shah and the capture of the palace, the presses were used to print money both to pay for their anti-US campaigns as well as to destablize the US economy.\\n\\nUS support for brutal regimes is nothing new.  The US philosophy of international relations was and still remains \"My enemy's enemy is my friend\".  Because of this, the US has gotten into bed with some very reprehensible \"leaders\", all in the name of \"US interests\".  For nearly 20 years, the US supported Saddam and sold him WMDs.  The US funded and helped train the Mujahadeen who later became the Taliban.  The US supports Israel unquestioningly, regardless of its actions (and that includes blaming the captain of the USS Cole for Israeli jet fighters firing on the vessel and killing US soldiers).\n\nAnswer:",

Is it true that Russian women always add an 'a' to the end of the last name? Also, how are patronymic names chosen? What are some common female patronymic names? Thanks.\nAnswer: If you are born outside of Russia, you usually do not add 'a' to the end of your Russian last name. Otherwise, we always do. It is not really our choice, but the way language works. In Russia, middle names are patronymic. For example, a man named Ivan whose father's name is Nikolay would be known as Ivan Nikolayevich or \"Ivan, son of Nikolay\" (with Nikolayevich as a patronymic). For women, the ending is -yevna or -ovna.\n\nAnswer:",

If one person doesn't do their assignment, the whole play is shot!\\n\\nThe most important is the O line.  It doesn't matter if you have the best QB in the world, if he doesn't have the time to throw it to the best reciever in the world.  If you have an average RB behind a good line, he will have more yards than a great RB behind a crap line.  An O line that can block for 4 yards every run play then opens up the QB to do his thing and get all the glory.\\n\\nOn defense, it is the D line.  They are the ones who fill the holes up front against the run, taking blocks and jamming the line, allowing the Linebackers to get the tackles.  Most DB interceptions happen because the D line has pressure the QB into a bad throw.\n\nAnswer:",

Since this equation can be written -9 + 1/x^2, when x gets large, 1/x^2 gets small with respect to -9, and can be ignored, leaving  -9 as the symptote.   As x->0, the 1/x^2 dominates, so the vertical asymptote is 1/x^2.  There is a discontinuity at x=0 where the function is undefined.\n\nAnswer:",

Most women stop growing shortly after they have their first menstruation. Considering that you are 17 years old...I'd have to say that you aren't growing much more, if at all. I'm only 5'4\". I know women that are only 4'11\". Wear heels if you want to be taller. At least you won't be a really tall woman and have to worry about dating a tall guy so that it doesn't look weird or hunch over to talk to my short to average height friends.

Catholics seem to be tolerant of just about everybody.  And that's a good thing.\n\nAnswer:",

In the most basic form, you will need to file a notice of appeal.  In many states, it is up to the appellant to create the record for the court of appeal by designating what documents the trial court clerk should copy and send to the court to the court fo appeal.  The appellant may also need to pay for and arrange for copies of the trial transcript to be availble for the court of appeal.  AFter the record is complete, you must file an opening brief.  The respondent files an opposition brief and you file a reply.  Sometimes the court will hear oral argument.  This is just the BARE basics, so get an attorney right away.\n\nAnswer:",

Here is a general guide for Korea: \\n\\n* GREETING GESTURES\\no Among themselves, bowing is the traditional form for both greeting and departing.\\no Western and Korean male friends usually greet with both a slight bow and shaking hands. When shaking hands, both hands are sometimes used. Women usually do not shake hands, especially with men, but usually just nod slightly. The senior person offers to shake hands first, but the junior person bows first. However, shake hands with a light grip and perhaps with eyes averted.\\no Avoid hugging and kissing when greeting.\\no Prolonged direct eye contact is considered impolite and even intimidating.\\no Business cards are traded respectfully. Keep the card on the table in front of you as just one small gesture of respect.\\no When saying good-bye, the traditional gesture is the bow, but the younger generation has adopted the western custom of waving good-bye by moving their arm side-to-side.\\n* TOUCHING GESTURES\\no Generally speaking, the Koreans are not a touch-oriented society (especially true for visitors.) So avoid touching or any prolonged form of body contact.\\no Public display of affection are very rare. On the other hand, you may note people of the same sex walking hand-in-hand, which is simply a gesture of friendship.\\no Don't worry about a bit of pushing in stores or when groups board public buses or trains. Apologies are neither offered or expected.\\n* BECKONING GESTURES\\no The open hand or the middle finger is used for pointing.\\no To beckon someone, the palm faces downward and the fingers are moved in a scratching motion. Using the arm and hand up, palm toward the face is used only for calling dogs and children.\\n* OTHER NONVERBAL GESTURES\\no Respect is always shown to elderly people, so it is appropriate to rise when a person-- especially an elderly man enters the room or giving up a seat on a subway. However, an elder may not give up a seat for a young boy.\\no Men generally have priority in Korea: Go through a door first, walk ahead of women, and women may help them on with their coats.\\no Among the Koreans, laughter is used to disguise many emotions: anger, frustration, and fear.\\no Loud talking or laughing is usually avoided. Koreans, especially women will cover their mouths laughing, resulting in giggling rather than wide open-mouth laughing.\\no Periods of silence are common and accepted, even during dinners.\\no Correct posture is important, especially when seated. Don't slouch or put your feet on desks or chairs. Try to maintain a balanced posture, stand or sit erectly or squarely. When seated have both feet squarely on the ground with arms in the lap or on the armrests. Crossing the legs at the knees or ankles is the preferred form rather than with one ankle over the other knee.\\no When walking in public, keep to the left side of the walkway and stairway.\\n* OTHER NONVERBAL GESTURES\\no It is considered impolite to enter a room without knocking first. However, Koreans may not wait for you to come to the door and open it. They may knock and then enter.\\no When walking in public places, direct eye contact is uncommon in the larger cities. However, visitors may be the subject of much curiosity and therefore you may notice some stares.\\no Blowing you nose in public is considered rude, especially at a meal. Paper tissues are used for blowing the nose and then discarded.\\no When entering a private home, it is usually customary to remove your shoes.\\no Spitting (except for young women) and burping in public is acceptable.\n\nAnswer:",

Most people have started using an engagement party as an excuse for gifts since everyone invited already knows, which is just tacky. You don't have an engagement party if everyone already know your engaged. Traditionally the bride's parents host an engagement party. The bride's mother sends out invites to a dinner party or barbeque or luncheon, whatever type of party it's going to be. The bride's father announces the engagement at some point during the beginning of the party.\n\nAnswer:",

They can be distinguished because they have different masses (from a different number of neutrons in the nucleus). But this effect is usually very small. One exception is hydrogen. The isotope consisting of one protoon and one neutron in the nucleus (deuterium) has double the mass of a regular hydrogen atom, and this can have observable effects even on the chemistry.\n\nAnswer:",

There are several theories about the origin of the seas, but no single theory explains all aspects of this puzzle. Many earth scientists agree with the hypothesis that both the atmosphere and the oceans have accumulated gradually through geologic time from some process of \"degassing\" of the Earth's interior. According to this theory, the ocean had its origin from the prolonged escape of water vapor and other gases from the molten igneous rocks of the Earth to the clouds surrounding the cooling Earth. After the Earth's surface had cooled to a temperature below the boiling point of water, rain began to fall and continued to fall for centuries. As the water drained into the great hollows in the Earth's surface, the primeval ocean came into existence. The forces of gravity prevented the water from leaving the planet.\\n       All water, even rain water, contains dissolved chemicals which scientists call \"salts.\" But not all water tastes salty. Water is fresh or salty according to individual judgment, and in making this decision man is more convinced by his sense of taste than by a laboratory test. It is one's taste buds that accept one water and reject another.\\nOcean water is indeed a complex solution of mineral salts and of decayed biologic matter that results from the teeming life in the seas. Most of the ocean's salts were derived from gradual processes such the breaking up of the cooled igneous rocks of the Earth's crust by weathering and erosion, the wearing down of mountains, and the dissolving action of rains and streams which transported their mineral washings to the sea. Some of the ocean's salts have been dissolved from rocks and sediments below its floor. Other sources of salts include the solid and gaseous materials that escaped from the Earth's crust through volcanic vents or that originated in the atmosphere.\n\nAnswer:",

The withdrawl sensations are too overwhelming. Help!?\nQuestion: I've tried in the past to slowly decrease the dose so I can be zoloft free, but my face starts to feel numb and I get sensations of electric shocks in my head.  It's so weird!  I've talked to a few doctors about it and it seems that the drug is so new they basically don't understand it either.  The drug has done wonders for me in the last 6 years. Although I agree the drug is not for everyone, it saved me from a very dark place, and now that I've been in the light for a few years, I am ready to try life without the meds.  Anyone with this problem too?  What did you do?  Also, anyone with questions about the drug, please ask because I find that I am informative with experiences while on it, but not when trying to eliminate it from your life.\nAnswer: I know the sensation you're talking about. I was on Paxil for a while and when I was comming off it I got rushes through my head (felt like electricity), plus I'd get dizziness along with it that felt a little bit like vertigo. I cut my dose down gradually over about a month or so. Have you tried 75mg for a week then 50mg for a week, then 25mg for a week, then one every other day for a week?\n\nAnswer:",

Although first postulated in print by a French infantry captain in 1915, infiltration tactics were developed by the German Army and executed from autumn 1917. Their first use is credited to General Oskar von Hutier (1857-1934) in the German Eighth Army\u2019s successful attack on Riga of 1 September 1917, and they were generally known in German circles as \u201cHutier tactics\u201d.\\nInfiltration tactics were a radical departure from orthodox breakthrough assaults against entrenched positions. Instead of following a long preliminary bombardment with a massed infantry rush at wrecked forward trenches, small forces of \u201cstormtroopers\u201d (initially companies, later battalions) were slipped between enemy strongpoints after a short \u201churricane\u201d barrage. Their task was to surprise rear areas and artillery positions while heavily defended positions would be bypassed and dealt with by the main infantry attack, following up to storm frontline trenches, and forward units would be given priority in the use of aircraft support and reinforcements.\n\nAnswer:",

I said MAIN reasons. There are, however, many others that we could address.\\n\\nThe first reason is that around eighty-five per cent of the citizens of the United States of America celebrate Christmas.\\nIf forty-three per cent of the voters in this country could elect Bill Clinton president, then 85 per cent of the people should be able to have it their way, too.\\n\\nSecondly, the people who celebrate Christmas are, for the most part, kind and happy people. And when the birthday of Jesus rolls around they celebrate exuberantly. They want every one in the world to have a happy and merry time along with them.\\nSaying Merry Christmas to you has nothing to do with what you personally believe in. It's what's on the greeting itself that you should concentrate. It's okay if you don't believe in it. Celebrate with the rest of us. Be happy along with us.\\n\\nI woudn't let anyone hug you though. Ya know?\\n\\nI don't even let anyone hug me at Mardi Gras.\\n\\nHey, now there's a celebration you oughta try if you want real happy folks around you.\\n\\nHave a Merry Christmas.\n\nAnswer:",

Even when I apply for store credit cards I get denied. I really don't want a secured card. Any way to get one?\nAnswer: You have to build credit history first. The first card is the hardest to get. Get a secured card first, then once you build credit history then you can have a regular credit card. Secured card is you give the bank the amount of money that you want for your credit limit and the give you a card for that amount.. For instance if you give them $200.00 then they will give you a line of credit for $200. If you give $300' then the give you a $300. credit line. Than  once you do that for about 6 months or more then try for a card. Good Luck to you. Even if you don't want it a secured card is the only way you will get the regular one i don't think you have any other options.\n\nAnswer:",

The only stuff i know is Greek, and that isnt much. So if  you could tell me everything you know about WHATEVER kind of Mythology, i would appriciate it alot. I cant go to anywhere but yahoo, so please dont give me references. Thank you!\\n\\n\\nI would like as many people as possible to answer this question, no matter if someone else already answered something that you know about as well. There are many different versions!\nAnswer: Here is what I found on Egyptian mythology\\nGods\\nEarly beliefs can be split into 5 distinct localized groups,\\n\\nthe Ennead of Heliopolis, whose chief god was Atum \\nthe Ogdoad of Hermopolis, where the chief god was Ra \\nthe Chnum-Satet-Anuket triad of Elephantine, where the chief god was Chnum \\nthe Amun-Mut-Chons triad of Thebes, where the chief god was Amun \\nthe Ptah-Sekhmet-Nefertem triad of Memphis, unusual in that the gods were unconnected before the triad was formalized, where the chief god was Ptah \\nThroughout the vast and complex history of Egypt, the dominant beliefs of the ancient Egyptians merged and mutated as leaders of different groups gained power. This process continued even after the end of the Egyptian civilization as we know it today. As an example, during the New Kingdom Ra and Amun became Amun-Ra. This \"merging\" into a single god is typically referred to as syncretism. Syncretism should be distinguished from mere groupings, also referred to as \"families\" such as Amun, Mut and Khonsu, where no \"merging\" takes place. Over time, deities took part in multiple syncretic relationships, for instance, the combination of Ra and Horus into Ra-Herakty. However, even when taking part in such a syncretic relationship, the original deities did not become completely \"absorbed\" into the combined deity, although the individuality of the one was often greatly weakened. Also, these syncretic relationships sometimes involved more than just two deities, for instance, Ptah, Seker and Osiris, becoming Ptah-Seker-Osiris. The goddesses followed a similar pattern. Also important to keep in mind is that sometimes the attributes of one deity got closely associated with another, without any \"formal\" syncretism taking place. For instance, the loose association of Hathor with Isis.\\n\\nAn interesting aspect of ancient Egyptian religion is that deities sometimes played different conflicting roles. As an example, the lioness Sekhmet being sent out by Ra to devour the humans for having rebelled against him, but later on becoming a fierce protectress of the kingdom, life in general and the sick. Even more complex is the roles of Set. Judging the mythology of Set from a modern perspective, especially the mythology surrounding Set's relationship with Osiris, it is easy to cast Set as the arch villain and source of evil. This is wrong, however, as Set was earlier playing the role of destroyer of Apep, in the service of Ra on his barge, and thus serving to uphold Ma'at (Truth, Justice and Harmony).\\n\\nGiven the diverse tapestry of religious history in ancient Egypt, it comes as no surprise that many different forms of theism evolved. Although mainly henotheistic in nature, at some point even monotheism, as introduced by Akhenaten thrived. What is important to realize is that it is very dangerous to try and cast the religion of the ancient Egyptians in any particular theistic form. Even more dangerous to claim is that, towards the end of the Egyptian civilization, a drive toward monotheism was taking place. The evidence of the time (Greaco-Roman period) seems counter to this belief: although syncretism was still taking place (sometimes and more frequently between Egyptian and non-Egyptian deities), many deities were still revered and served. As an example the following which Thoth enjoyed during these later periods. This is quite evident when one simply looks at the vast number of mummified Ibis birds offered to him. Also, the belief in Egyptian deities were spreading to countries other than Egypt. For instance the Roman belief in, and following of Isis.\\n\\nThe Egyptians believed that in the beginning, the universe was filled with the dark waters of chaos. The first god, Re-Atum, appeared from the water as the land of Egypt appears every year out of the flood waters of the Nile. Re-Atum spat and out of the spittle came out the gods Shu (air) and Tefnut (moisture). The world was created\n\nAnswer:",

And if we were to only take it up, we could lift our world instead of being frightened and overwhelmed by it. \\nLeverage is the multiplier effect that lets you create tipping points that help you lift your world. Inspiration for Leverage comes from Archimedes, the early Greek mathematician who proclaimed, \"Give me a lever long enough and a place to stand, and I could lift the world.\" Checketts has written a book that shows us where our levers are in every situation. Because the fast-paced world we live in is all about leverage - those with it, win; those without it, stay mired in the muck. \\n\\nLeverage contains 25 keys to greater leverage for leadership in business and success in life. You will learn how to: \\n\\n\u2022 Demystify the idea of vision and make it the force for getting where you intend to go. \u2022 Discover what you really want and what you must give to get it. \u2022 Embrace the 21st Century standard of excellence: What is theoretically possible? \u2022 Move beyond conflict resolution to harness the power of opposites. \u2022 Turn on your \"receptive force\" to hear what the world is trying to tell you. \u2022 Make commitment the most magnificent word in your vocabulary. \u2022 Achieve crystal-clear agreement with those who share your destiny. \u2022 Discover four distinct dimensions of thinking that will deepen your understanding and invigorate your intuition. \u2022 Expand your partnerships as the most powerful way to extend your leverage. \u2022 Know the value of what you create to build the wealth that will last. \\n\\nChecketts will take you to memorable places, introduce you to fascinating personalities, and explore situations that illustrate the power of the leverage we all seek. \\n\\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Leverage-Create-Tipping-Points-Business/dp/156414870X\\n\\nEnjoy :-)\n\nAnswer:",

He has no friends out here. He is a total snob. He shows off to everyone out here. We have an association and he does not abide by any of the rules. They have fined him. He defies that. They have gone as far as law suits. He threatens them and they back off. He took out a half page of the local newspaper telling how horrible his home was to try and make the other home values go down. He is smart enough to know his limits. He has never crossed the line, so nothing can be done to him. He was once made to put his house up for sale by the association. He made sure that he was a total a$$ to all prospects, which led to no sale and getting rid of him. He paid cash for his house and he flaunts that at everyone. What would you do? I am newly elected on the board here and we are totally dumbfounded. Our attorney says there is nothing more we can do until he breaks the law. We just want to get rid of him!!\nAnswer: So what, he threatened to sell to a sex offender? What is the problem there? At least he didn't threaten to sell to a drug dealer/user or a drunk driver. They both have a much higher rate of recidivism than a rehabilitated former sex offender. They also kill more children than a rehabilitated former sex offender. So would you rather have those in your neighborhood? Of course, in all actuality, you most likely already have them in your neighborhood. You just don't know it because there is no registry for them.\\n\\nYour child also has a 90 to 95% chance of being sexually abused by someone known to the family that isn't on a registry. Compare that to the 5.3% rearrest and 3.5% reconviction rate for rehabilitated former sex offenders.\\n\\nJust leave the guy alone. You people are feeding into him. He is enjoying the fight. You already know you can't beat him so just ignore him. You know what they say, \"Ignorance is Bliss\".\n\nAnswer:",

It's a slap in the face to all the self-victimized, welfare cultured african-americans who blame all their ills on white racism.  If black africans can come to this country, often with little or nothing, and succeed in a relatively short timeframe, it proves that the racism that the african american leaders, such as Al Sharpton and Jesse Jackson, claim to be pervasive, doesn't exist at all.\\n\\nBottom line:  It proves to the african american population that they are largely lazy, ignorant failures...and it's all self-inflicted.\n\nAnswer:",

This is bothering me.?\nQuestion: I love my boyfriend....we have been together over 4 years now, and we are both 21. He is into a lot of game playing, and I am not--so he hangs out with a group of guys that I haven't really met. Because I have no interest in playing a lot of games, that is all fine and dandy.\\n\\nHowever, he acts so differently around his friends! I have met a few of them, and when he is around them he gets all hyper and \"jokingly arrogant\". He is always cracking jokes and being somewhat loud and outspoken. When he is around me, he is the total opposite. I know him to be somewhat quiet, softspoken, and sweet. Even when he talks on the phone to his friends, this weird personality deviation is in place. Why does he act one way to me....and so differently toward his male friends? Should I be worried?\nAnswer: I know what you mean. It's like when he get's together with his friends they turn onn a switch that makes him totally different. Trust me I had the same problem. I talked to him and asked why he acts so different around his frinds. You should ask him why he acts like that and talk to him about how you feel.\\n\\nTrust me it will work 9 out of 10 times if he really cares for you.\n\nAnswer:",

A DNA molecule refers to just a double stranded molecule but a chromosome is a condensed form of DNA complexed with proteins. An intermediate is the chromatin which is a network of fibrils consisting of DNA and they exist when the cell is not dividing.\\n\\n2. Prokaryotes have a single chromosme that contains only few proteins and appear as an electron-dense irregular shaped region called the nucleoid which is not enclosed by membrane. If you stretched this out, the chromosome would be a circular loop attached to the plasma membrane of the cell. Also, when they replicate, the replication occurs in two directions at once since the DNA molecule is cirular. Eukaryotes have much more proteins and when not being replicated are in the membrane bound nucleas as chromatin. Then the DNA replicates, it is dones by numerous origins of replication initially called replication bubbles that meet up to form replication forks. The broken segments of this replication method is calked Okazaki framents.\\n\\n3.Autosomal chromosomes are the rest of the chromosomes that are nonsex and are the same no matter what sex the person is. For example, there are 46 chromosomes in humans and one PAIR is your sex chromosome which determine your sex (girl = XX and boy = XY) while the other 44 are autosomal which you inherited no matter what your sex was.\\n\\n4. The word \"complexity\" is hard to define here because it is ambiguous and subjective. To us humans, a zebra may seem less complex since we cant tell them appart, but from the zebra's prospective, their unique stripe patterns differntiate very clearly who is who. At birth, the mother zebra spends 20 min. with its calf so it can memorize stripe patterns. However, understand the aim of the question, the answer is no. There is no proven evidence that shows a direct correlation of chromosome number to complexity. Well, you may think that since there are more chromosomes, these organisms have more alleles coded for them and are thus more complex. Not necessarily true. Some genes code for mutliple traits while others may have multiple genes for one trait. Also the vast number of genes that are coded in a single chromosome is very high. Ex. A Human has 46 chromosomes but a Crayfish has 200! Therefore more chromosomes do not mean higher \"complexity\" (at least in this implied definition)\n\nAnswer:",

However, I did quite well when I got to college.  You will find that there are plenty of students in the same boat as you.  In fact,  those students who did well at AP won't be in your fall semester classes anyway, because they probably passed the test and got credit.  They'll join in 2nd semester, and it will be that much more difficult for them, as it will have been a semester since they had science.  Here are some tips for success:  \\n\\n1.  Form a study group.  It always helps to have a little extra motivation.\\n\\n2.  Do all of your homework.  Homework isn't for the prof, he/she probably won't even grade it.  It helps you learn the material.\\n\\n3.  Do EXTRA problems.  My profs bought the solutions manuals (if yours don't, you could buy it yourself) and put them in the library so that we could check all of our work.\\n\\n4.Tutor.  It is when you can teach the material to another person that you begin to truely understand.  I tutored my way through college, and found that it was not only a great money maker (and I could set my own hours), but it helped me learn the most.  Now of course, this one will only work as long as your grades are kept up...but again, its extra motivation.\\n\\nGood luck!  You will do fine.\n\nAnswer:",

What happens in the eye when we do that?\nAnswer: there are little muscles above and below the lens of the eye, which, in profile, is shaped like an oval or elipse.  When those muscles are relaxed or flexed, the oval is either stretched or becomes shorter, changing the shape of the lens, thus manipulating lightrays (reflecting off of the thing we are \"seeing\") traveling through the lens, so that these rays (depending on the distance you are from what you're looking at and what you're doing with those muscles) are more focused or less focused in the retina.  If the light rays aren't focused correctly back there, then you've got a blurry image.  At least, that's what I THINK is going on if I remember correctly from a class I took last year....  So, in short, it's our ability to manipulate our eyes' lenses with those little muscles that makes us able to blur (or focus) our vision... good luck.\n\nAnswer:",

Thank you.?\nQuestion: I am looking to buy a new laptop and i know very little about them or computers period for that matter. I'm looking for reliabilty more than anything else. I dont want to be fixing the damn thing up every two weeks. No screen problems, no crashing motherboards, no excessive overheating. I hope you guys can help!!! Thanks again. Also if you could give me a crash course on computer specifications and what exactly they mean. (gigahertz, pentium, celeron) what is all that a measurement of, and how should it affect me when i go to buy my notebook. What should i be looking for. I'll be using the notebook for internet and typing papers. Thanks guys!!!\nAnswer: I work on an HP Compaq NC6000 that work supplied me and I like it.  I've had it over a year. It's been reliable and fast.  My wife has owned a Toshiba for over three years.\\n\\nI surf the internet, play music on it, write technical papers, send e-mails, write programs, and run numerical analyses on it.\\n\\nBattery life could be better.  I can only go for about an hour and a half before the battery depletes.\\n\\nIf you are going to be taking notes in classes, you may want to get two batteries for it so you can get several hours of uptime without connecting to a power supply.\\n\\nThe rest of it ... Gigahertz, Pentium, Celeron, AMD really doesn't matter these days.  Almost any laptop will play DVDs (with a DVD player), CDs, etc plenty fast.\\n\\nIn fact, the lower the Gigahertz (the clock rate which at which the processor (AMD or Intel) ticks along), the longer your batter life may be.  Slowest Gigahertz you should go with is about 1.5GHz.\\n\\nI would make sure that the notebook has at least 512MB of memory, preferably 1GB.  This is important if you run several programs at once (e-mail, internet, music player, and word processor).  If you don't, things can slow down and wear down battery life faster as data is moved on and off disk.\\n\\nI would go with a 15\" LCD.  17\" is better if you are at your desk all the time, but if you are carrying the thing around a lot, the smaller display makes for a more compact laptop.  To each his own.\\n\\nAny brand-name laptop (HP, Dell, IBM, Toshiba) should do well to meet your requirements.\n\nAnswer:",

So if you really just need Omega 3s Flax is the best choice.\\nIf you also want Omega 6s then Hemp. \\n\\nBTW: Flax is probably the cheapest. You can buy a small bag that could last you a couple of months for less than $3 at any health food store.  All you have to do is grind it up in a coffee grinder and sprinkle the crushed seeds onto cereal, salads or bake into bread or muffins. \\n\\nI tried hemp oil some time back and didn't care for how it made me feel in the morning.  \\nYou might try both in small amounts one at a time and take note of how you feel afterwards.\\n\\nThe very best is fish oil but you have to make sure it's filtered. The body must convert vegetable sources of Omega 3s to the kind your body can use.\n\nAnswer:",

Like Slimquick and any others you can think of.?\nAnswer: Any diet will work, keep in mind the following before choosing your next diet:\\n\\nDiets and changing your eating to healthy food choices can work but because we know so little about ourselves and our relationship with food, it makes it difficult to win the battle. A lot of us have problems with dieting because we have a problem called \"emotional eating\" we eat to comfort ourselves during difficult, stressful, sad, etc times in our lives.\\n\\nYou may experience all those emotions during dieting as we continuously get on the scale hoping to see a big difference in numbers after dieting only for a day or two. Also what is stressful when dieting is that we try to lose a large number of weight in such a short period of time which in most cases is unreasonable. \\n\\nThis all brings about stress, discomfort and sadness. When we feel this way, we turn to our best friend for help and support which for many of us is food. The diet is now broken and we feel that we can't stick to diets. We then try fad diet after fad diet hoping to lose the original 20 pounds and now we may have as much as 30 pounds to lose because we continue to put on weight as we continue to break these fad diets by binging before starting our next diet. \\n\\nPlease learn about your relationship with food before your next diet so that you may achieve your goals. To help a little, keep in mind the following:\\n\\nYou already know how to lose weight. You know that if you eat less and exercise more eventually you\u2019ll see the pounds come off. What\u2019s getting in your way? Why do you usually regain the weight you lost? The answer to all these questions is the same \u201cEmotional Eating.\u201d Simply defined, emotional eating means you eat to satisfy emotional hunger; it means you use food for comfort or as a way to cope with life; and it means you eat for reasons other than what your body needs. Whenever you reach for a boredom-breaking snack despite your commitment, or whenever you eat to quell anxiety, that\u2019s emotional eating. Whenever you binge after a fight, or double up on portions because your day turned sour, that\u2019s emotional eating. Whenever you feel that sharp craving for your favorite food, that\u2019s emotional eating. When we eat during these times while on a diet, we believe the diet doesn\u2019t work or that we lack self control and then look for the quickest way to lose weight (fasting/diet pills, ect) after eating all we can since we already messed the diet day up. Read the information below but remember that emotional eating plays a big part in why we don\u2019t continue dieting and why we regain lost weight and why we binge today and start a new diet tomorrow. Best of Luck.\\n\\nP.S. After learning about my relationship with food, I was able to drop my weight from 263 pounds down to 151 pounds which is a 112 pound weight lost.\n\nAnswer:",

He is 6ft tall and 200lb, and 13years old. He wants somthing plenty powerful and somthing that he doesn't have to work on alot and he wants either a honda or yamaha. And he would be riding it up and down the roads alot so i think it needs to be an offroad bike.\nAnswer: The best dirtbike is the safest one.  That usually means a snickers-powered one.  These are also known by the more common name of mountain bikes.  The best ones are made by Cannondale and Trek, and start at about $400.  They require relatively inexpensive tune-ups every so often, and new brake and shifter cables about once a year.  This will get him off his tuches and out in the wilderness.  Remember that a $100 helmet will protect him more than a $100 pair of shoes!\n\nAnswer:",

Swing is one part of the Java Foundation Classes (JFC). Swing includes graphical user interface (GUI) widgets such as text boxes, buttons, split-panes, and tables.\\n\\nSwing widgets provide more sophisticated GUI components than the earlier Abstract Windowing Toolkit. Since they are written in pure Java, they run the same on all platforms, unlike the AWT which is tied to the underlying platform's windowing system. Swing supports pluggable look and feel \u2013 not by using the native platform's facilities, but by roughly emulating them. This means you can get any supported look and feel on any platform. The disadvantage of lightweight components is possibly slower execution. The advantage is uniform behavior on all platforms.\n\nAnswer:",

My daughter has biblical beleifs towards evolution and this boy just wasnt buying it. But he was opened to what she had to say. Everything she shared with him, he had an opposite response to. he kept asking her to \"please convince me. i want to believe\"  So my daughter came to me for advice, and im at a loss.\nAnswer: I will have to support Evolution! Let me give you a definition of Evolution!\\nBiological evolution, simply put, is descent with modification. This definition encompasses small-scale evolution (changes in gene frequency in a population from one generation to the next) and large-scale evolution (the descent of different species from a common ancestor over many generations).\\nDocumentation of ancestor-descendant relationships among organisms also comes from the fields of biogeography, taxonomy, anatomy, embryology and, most recently, genetics \u2014 particularly DNA analysis.\\nThe fossil record remains first and foremost among the databases that document changes in past life on Earth. Fossils provide the dimension of time to the study of life. Some of the most basic observations about fossils and the rock record were made long before Darwin formulated his theory of \u201cdescent with modification.\u201d The fossil record clearly shows changes in life through almost any sequence of sedimentary rock layers. Successive rock layers contain different groups or assemblages of fossil species.\\n{We have now more than enough fossils to determine for sure that humans didn\u2019t appear on this planet in the genetic form they are today!\\nWE HAVE MORE THAN ENOUGH EVIDENCE THAT THERE WAS AT LEAST ANOTHER SPECIES WHICH LIVED WITH US!! And I am talking about Neanderthal man who was not our ancestor but a different Human than us!!! (Did God experiment with human species?) We even have proof that at a certain point in time 3 human species shared the planet! (Homo sapiens, Homo Erectus, Homo Neanderthals)}\\nOf course I want comment the stupid argument why all the apes didn\u2019t evolve to humans. Ok I will comment!!\\n(We share a recent common ancestor with chimpanzees and gorillas; we have many anatomical, genetic, biochemical, and even behavioral similarities with these African great apes. We are less similar to the Asian apes--orangutans and gibbons--and even less similar to monkeys, because we share common ancestors with these groups in the more distant past. \\n! By the way why God decided to create 5 different species of primates and 280 different species of monkeys?)\\nAs a conclusion Evolution is not a theory but a proven fact (In scientific terms, \"theory\" does not mean \"guess\" or \"hunch\" as it does in everyday usage. Scientific theories are explanations of natural phenomena built up logically from testable observations and hypotheses. Biological evolution is the best scientific explanation we have for the enormous range of observations about the living world.) Creation is a Hebrew Myth and unfortunately is not a fact but a myth!!!!\n\nAnswer:",

The chief problem may be that you are keying on the earnings reporting date, not the quarter ending date.  \\n\\nThus, if a company reports great results for the quarter 1/06-3/06, but they report their earnings on 4/15/06, you want to see what happened to the stock beginning 4/15 going forward (and you may or may not be interested in the activity on 4/15 itself depending on whether they reported before the market opened, or after it closed).  To do this analysis precisely and automatically with some sort of screening software may not be possible because the earnings reporting dates vary.\\n\\nBest way I can think of to do this is go to \\n\\nwww.earnings.com\\n\\nNot all companies info will be given here, but for a whole lot of companies you can get the history of conference calls for a company, what they reported as earnings, and how this reported number compares to their guidance if they gave any.  Based on the time of day for the conference call you can also make a good guess as to whether the company reported earnings before the market opened or after the market closed.  From there you have to just look for companies that consistently beat quidance and had increasing earnings and check them out.\\n\\nAlso, though you are not asking for my advice, let me throw it in anyhow (you can ignore it if you want).  It sounds like you are trying to get a system for buying certain companies before earnings hoping for either a pop in price after earnings or a slow progression upwards until the next earnings date.  I think you may be onto something, but I doubt you will find an easy little system to follow.  Each company behaves differently (some always beat earnings, some usually hit earnings, some are erratic) but the companies behavior is well known by the people who track the stock and probably built into the price before earnings.  Thus, you are trying to estimate what actual earnings will be compared not to what past earings have been, nor compared to the companies own guidance but rather compared to the markets consensus of what the earnings should be and who knows what that number is.  Also, more important than the companies earnings might be their forward guidance and this may drive the price alot more than the actual earnings.\\n\\nTo give an example for that last sentence, supposed a company consistently beats earnings by varying amounts, and is growing at 20-30% per year.  They guide their earnings 10% above last years number, but since they always beat the market may decide they are just being cautious and based on how their industry has been chugging along the market prices the stock as if earnings will come in 30% above last year.  Earnings come in and are 20% above last year.  On the day they report earnings, the company shows 20% growth, and is still 10% above quidance but will nonetheless probably have a really bad day because the actual earnings are 10% below what the market was expecting.\\n\\nTo give another example suppose a company is growing 20%, is expected to earn 20% more than last year, hits the number perfectly, but then guides lower for next quarter.  Watch out below, the earnings in this case is meaningless.\\n\\nI guess what I'm saying is there are alot of details to consider and if you get it right 2/3rd of the time you may end up a millionaire in spite of having some really bad days.  Anyhow, www.earnings.com may be the place to look for this data, and best luck with your analysis.\n\nAnswer:",

I personally agree with the author of the article.  In it he describes how the race for this nomination is party machine (Clinton) versus what he calls the 'netroots', the rising influence of the hip new internet bloggers and website go-ers.  This was the case with the last election where Kerry (the Establishment party machine) won against Dean (the netroot) in the end, and yet wound up losing anyway.  People hate Hillary, and I think she will lose against ANY Republican candidate (especially McCain).  So do you think she should get the nomination.  Personally I think she should act like a Trojan horse for the Dems; let the Republicans think she is the one they are backing, and then at the last minute throw support into some long shot candidate.\\n\\nhttp://observer.guardian.co.uk/columnists/story/0,,1771831,00.html\\n\\nThats the article, what do you think?\nAnswer: It doesn't really matter now does it. The only hope for this country is if a viable third party candidate runs. The two major parties are totally out of touch with the American public, the constitution and the vision of our founding fathers.\\n\\n They both have their own agendas,Republicans-big business interests and big business interests(One track minds),Democrats-social programs and big business interests. The heart of America(The middle class) is left out.\\n\\n A good third party candidate is our only hope.\\n\\n I will tell the Dems this. If you put ANY candidate out there that supports pro-choice, you will lose. That is a no compromise issue. I know many many people that agreed with Democrats on many issues, as a matter of fact on most issues, but they would not and WILL NEVER compromise on that issue. That is so important to them that they will vote on that one issue only. As much as they may hate the candidate's stand on every other issue, it doesn't matter if he supports them on that issue. They will vote for him. Bank on it.\\n\\n Also the gay issue drives them crazy. These are not right wing religious crazies either. These are Joe and Sue six pack that doesn't want to see guys walking down the street holding hands and kissing. They don't want their kids to see it either. That's reality people. They are not homophobes. A phobia, by the way, is a fear. They are not afraid of them. They just hold the belief that that way of life is not moral and they don't want their child to see it. Believe it or not the parents have rights too.\\n\\n So everyone be forewarned that if the Democratic candidate comes out in favor of pro-choice and pro gay marriage they  will lose. Sorry, that's just the way it is. Those are the two issues that cost Dems the last two elections and THINGS HAVE NOT CHANGED. Those are no compromise issues! As much as you rant and rail and tell them that they are homophobes and are not allowing women the right to make decisions about their own bodies, it will not matter. It's not, as many Dems. so arrogantly think, that people don't get it or that they are backward or are religious loons. It's simply that they DISAGREE WITH YOU!\\n \\n Now don't get me wrong, my personal belief is that Bush is a loon and that Chaney is a truly evil person. I didn't vote for them. But I didn't vote for Kerry either. They were both awful. But people feel VERY strongly about those issues and they will FIGHT VERY HARD to make sure a candidate doesn't win who supports them. That has not changed! So as happy as you are about Bush's current free fall be prepared for a vicious fight.\n\nAnswer:",

The von Bertalanffy growth function (VBGF) introduced by von Bertalanffy in 1938 predicts the length of a shark as a function of its age, L = L(t): L(t) = Loo - (Loo - Lo) exp(-kt) \\n2.  Examples of exponential growth\\nBiology. \\nMicroorganisms in a culture dish will grow exponentially, at first, after the first microorganism appears (but then logistically until the available food is exhausted, when growth stops). \\nA virus (SARS, West Nile, smallpox) of sufficient infectivity (k > 0) will spread exponentially at first, if no artificial immunization is available. Each infected person can infect multiple new people. \\nHuman population, if the number of births and deaths per person per year were to remain constant (but also see logistic growth). \\nMany responses of living beings to stimuli, including human perception, are logarithmic responses, which are the inverse of exponential responses; the loudness and frequency of sound are perceived logarithmically, even with very faint stimulus, within the limits of perception. This is the reason that exponentially increasing the brightness of visual stimuli is perceived by humans as a smooth (linear) increase, rather than an exponential increase. This has survival value. Generally it is important for the organisms to respond to stimuli in a wide range of levels, from very low levels, to very high levels, while the accuracy of the estimation of differences at high levels of stimulus is much less important for survival. \\nElectroengineering \\nCharging and discharging of capacitors and changes in current in inductors are also exponential growth and decay phenomena. Engineers use a rule of five time constants to estimate when a steady state has been reached. \\nComputer technology \\nProcessing power of computers. See also Moore's law and technological singularity (under exponential growth, there are no such singularities). \\nInternet traffic growth. \\nWikipedia:Modelling Wikipedia's growth - an analysis of Wikipedia's growth rates based on article growth rates and other statistics \\nInvestment. The effect of compound interest over many years has a substantial effect on savings and a person's ability to retire. See also rule of 72 \\nPhysics \\nAtmospheric pressure decreases exponentially with increasing height above sea level, at a rate of about 12% per 1000m. \\nNuclear chain reaction (the concept behind nuclear weapons). Each uranium nucleus that undergoes fission produces multiple neutrons, each of which can be absorbed by adjacent uranium atoms, causing them to fission in turn. If the probability of neutron absorption exceeds the probability of neutron escape (a function of the shape and mass of the uranium), k > 0 and so the production rate of neutrons and induced uranium fissions increases exponentially, in an uncontrolled reaction. \\nNewton's law of cooling  where T is temperature, t is time, and, A, D, and k > 0 are constants, is an example of exponential decay. \\nMulti-level marketing \\nExponential increases appear in each level of a starting member's downline as each subsequent member recruits more people.\n\nAnswer:",

Who do you blame? Friar Lawrence/Romeo&Juliet/Chance/Fate? Why?\nAnswer: Hmm... I blame the feud between the houses of Capulet and Montague.  Without the fighting, Romeo might not have been banished, and then he wouldn't have heard that Juliet died and he wouldn't have killed himself and therefore Juliet wouldn't have killed herself.  Lady Montague wouldnt have died from heartache of Romeo's banishment.  Tybalt and Mercutio wouldn't have died from a swordfight.  Lots of trouble from that feuding...\n\nAnswer:",

My rent is 1800./month. I moved in in August 2005 and signed a one year lease. In February, 2006, the owners put it on the market.\\n\\nWhat are my rights AND responsibilities in terms of making this home available to prospective buyers?\\n\\nSo far, I have allowed showings without appointments three days a week within certain hours.\\n\\nI will be working from home for the summer, and cannot work with the threat of the doorbell ringing at any time. I have requested \"by appointment only\" and am getting significant flak from the listing agent.\\n\\nMy lease is up 7/31 at which point I'll be moving, but I need some advice for getting through the summer -- and to know whether if this all becomes to much, if I have the right to say \"ENOUGH.\" DO I HAVE TO LET PROSPECTIVE BUYERS IN THIS HOUSE, BY CA LAW? I need some advice as I have had no luck reading and interpreting CA code. Thanks.\nAnswer: The sale of the house has NO affect on your lease.  The buyer takes the house subject to the lease.\\n\\nThe lease should say something about the landlord's right to enter the premises.  While a showing is a valid purpose most states require advanced notice of intent to enter in writing.  There are also legal restrictions on the time of day i.e. not too early in the morning of after dinner at night.  The landlord's entry without advance notice is a lease violation.  You may be entitled to stop paying rent or terminate your tenancy as a result.\\n\\nThe bottom line is that you two are going to have to work it out.  If you are hostile during the showings the house will never sell, and thus the showings will never stop.\n\nAnswer:",

Gold is particularly good as a hedge against inflation, so if you're afraid of declining purchasing power of the dollar, gold may do well.  On the other hand, gold is a sterile investment, in that it doesn't produce any income.  It doesn't earn anything!  You're just counting on the fact that perhaps someone will value it more next year.  Maybe so, maybe not.\\n\\nI think the best strategy is to hold a small portion of gold as part of a larger investment strategy, but it would seem very unwise to put everything into gold.\n\nAnswer:",

Noise is primarily a nuisance effect, but heat is a potentially serious problem because winding insulation will be damaged if allowed to overheat. Heating may be minimized by good design, ensuring that the core does not approach saturation levels, that eddy currents are minimized, and that the windings are not overloaded or operated too close to maximum ampacity. \\n\\nLarge power transformers have their core and windings submerged in an oil bath to transfer heat and muffle noise, and also to displace moisture which would otherwise compromise the integrity of the winding insulation. Heat-dissipating \"radiator\" tubes on the outside of the transformer case provide a convective oil flow path to transfer heat from the transformer's core to ambient air: \\n\\nFollow the link for more information.\\nHope this helps you!\n\nAnswer:",

And that's probably hard to believe since you two are so close. Men like kissing and fooling around with women and they don't really care who the woman is or about her feelings. Maybe he is lonely and hadn't been with a girl in a long time and you were just there so he decided to fool around with you with out considering your feelings. I'm sorry but he doesn't seem like a good friend. I'd try to find other friends and spend more time with them. It doesn't mean you have to ignore him completely. But he obviously doesn't care about your feelings and you should hang out with  other people who will. \\n\\nAnother possibility is that he might have been confused and wanted to kiss you to see if he might have had any feelings for you as more than a friend. Then he realized you two can only be friends. \\n\\nHowever, I think that the first might be more correct. He was not being respectful or considerate. Even if he wanted to try going out with you, he shouldn't have fingered you. He could have asked you out on a date but not go so far. I think he was just being plain selfish and took advantage of you. \\n\\nI would advise you to forget him and find another guy. But if you still want to try to get closer to him and get into a boy friend-girl friend  relationship, I would advise you to give him some time, but always treat him well, but don't really hint or talk about romance. Just show him you care by your actions. If after a while, it still didn't work, ask him out and say that you would really appreciate it if he could at least give you a chance. Tell him you think that you two would get a long great and that you want a chance because it's worth getting to know a girl who loves him so much. But don't let anything too intimate happen between you two on the first dates. He should respect that. Good luck! I hope everything works out for you!\n\nAnswer:",

Iam currently on anti depressants and I feel as though I may be bipolar.\nAnswer: Talk to you psychiatrist.  The most notable clinical feature of bipolar disorder is dramatic mood swings.  As compared to an anxiety disorder or depression where your moods will may be impacted by external factors, but will otherwise remain relatively level, in bipolar disorder patients cycle through periods of mania and depression.  But you should really really talk to your psychiatrist - I assure you he or she knows a lot more about it that I do.  Also, antidepressents effect your mood (obviously - that's the whole point), and may be responsible for some or all of you symptoms.  Your doctor may want to try a different anti-depressent or take you off them entirely for a while before deciding on a new diagnosis.\\n\\nPS.

It may have something to do with our angular measurement system.  The Earth rotates 360\u00b0 every 24 hours.  Each hour represents 15\u00b0 of angular rotation.  Each minute of time represents 15 minutes of angular rotation and each second of time represents 15 seconds of angular rotation.

It seems like we've tried everything and nothings working. We've been trying for over 9 months now. I don't think we need to see a fertility doctor because we had no problems conceiving our first child. Any suggestions?\nAnswer: I assume your first pregnancy and birth went just fine, there's nothing that could have happened with your first baby to think there may be problems conceiving another one. \\nI know there is only a one week window each month in which a women can conceive, right after ovulation. Which is why OBGYN's tell you not to get worried until after a year or so of trying. I would recommend your husband wearing boxers (briefs constrict blood flow and keep their testicles too warm causing a lower sperm count). Changing your diet can make a difference too; avoid caffeine, nicotine, and liquor. Try reading Fertility Foods by Jeremy Groll. Over exercise can hinder ovulation in women also.\\nOther than that I would relax, don't worry too much about it, have some fun with the time you have together and all will come in due time.\\nGood luck!\n\nAnswer:",

In order to get elected, they require campaign donations. While most private citizens give these out of the goodness of their hearts, corporations and special interest groups do it to further their own interests. It's an investment to them. The larger the donation, the more ads they can run. The more ads they run, the greater their chance of winning.\\n\\n  Then, after they win, they have a list of \"favors\" that need to be repaid.\\n\\n  Consider this: George Bush's largest corporate campaign contributors were financial service companies, defense contractors, and pharmaceutical companies. From this we got the Social Security privatization plan, the Iraq War, and Medicaid Prescription drug plan.\n\nAnswer:",

Do you want to have all your financial worries sorted out? Do you want to win the lottery? The secret is very, very simple. Anybody can manage it. All you have to do is buy a ticket with the numbers that are going to be drawn at the next draw. If you do this I can GUARANTEE you will win the lottery.\\n\\n That's not exactly new information, is it?\\n\\nNeither is the idea that nobody can predict what those numbers will be. However, when a lottery machine selects the numbers this is in no sense a random action. It is 100% predictable. There is nothing stopping anybody calculating exactly which balls not only will, but MUST be drawn. Nothing stopping you. It will simply take a measuring and timing tolerance at the edge of possibility combined with a huge series of calculations.\\n\\nYou can measure the balls and know their properties. You can time the intervals between starting and stopping the contra-rotating tumble dryers. You can project the trajectories of every single ball and their interactions with each other. It can be done. But it would probably cost more than the size of the lottery jackpot to fund the project and nobody is going to be very happy with people standing around and timing the balls to that degree of accuracy, because one microsecond will totally disrupt all the calculations. The lottery ball machine is totally predictable and not in any way random, but exactly the same thing can be said about a woman. Both are determined and predictable systems, but they simulate randomness far more elegantly than true randomness would. True randomness is a willo-the-wisp entity, like infinity, the highest prime number and the function of half of the roundabouts in Warrington. Lottery machines are not random, but they are chaotic, and therefore, like the minds of women, very difficult to probe with the crude analytical tools we have at our disposal.\\n\\nSo, I can't tell you how to win the lottery. However, I can offer you some interesting advice that you might find helpful.\\n\\nYou have to be in it to win it\\nThis is a very common slogan used by lotteries and football pools companies alike. What this slogan is saying is you can't dream of winning the lottery or the pools unless you part with your beer tokens. Of course they are right. If you never buy a ticket you can never win. But how many times do you dream of winning? Do you have to win every week to be happy? Of course not. You only have to win once. So you only have to buy one ticket, at some time in the future to be able to legitimately dream of winning a huge jackpot.\\n\\nOne ticket will do\\nYour chance of winning a share in a big jackpot prize is very low. In the UK national lottery (now named Lotto) your chances of having a share of a top jackpot, by getting 6 balls out of 6 representing the numbers 1 to 49 are 1 in 13,983,816. \\n\\nNow most weeks people win, often several people share the jackpot. So it does happen. But if you staked \u00a35 every week on those odds you would not have a realistic expectation of winning a share in a jackpot in a normal lifetime. But you knew that anyway, didn't you?\\n\\nSo you might as well get used to the idea that winning the lottery is unlikely. But it's also nice to have a dream, it is good for your mental health. So here is the secret: Buy a ticket. One day. Maybe tomorrow. Maybe not.\n\nAnswer:",

I lost my footing and landed on my elbow, which resulted in my shoulder being jammed up.  It hurt the rest of the game but not to the point where playing was impossible.  my question to you is will this go away with some ice, anti inflammatories and rest? because usually when i land on my elbow like this it goes away by itself, but never had one hurt this much.\nAnswer: It's possible that it's more than just jammed - you may have sublexed it and damaged some tendons and/or muscles.  Wouldn't hurt to see a sports trainer at your school or an orthopedic doctor to make sure nothing is serious.  In the meantime, RICE (Rest, Ice, Compression, Elevation) to manage the swelling and the pain.\n\nAnswer:",

Its best as an asset allocation.  It just depends on the percentage you should put in your portfolio.  I wouldnt put any more than 5-10 percent in it.  I dont think now is a good time to have a large percentage of oil in your portfolio.  Oil is a business of boom and bust cycles.  And I think we are about at the end of this boom part of the cycle.  Inventories are going up and drilling is still pretty strong.  I think oil will drop significantly in the next few months.  The only thing thats holding it up now I believe is politics, and this business with Iran.  Once that's over with I think the price of oil will go down.  Although the US doesnt get any oil from Iran right now.\n\nAnswer:",

I think the best thing to do is go to your counselor (if you're in high school) and ask for a list of scholarship that are being offered. Check each one to see if you qualify for any and apply. Before you start college, make sure you fill out a FAFSA form.

The Bible speaks about sodomy, but always as a forced act or as part of a purely hedonistic culture.  Does this mean that God hates sodomy, or that he hates hedonism and rape?\\n\\nTo further question the teachings, one would begin to wonder, if God is all powerfull, and all-knowing (as in, he knows everything that was, everything that is, and everything that will be) and created everyone, why would he create some people knowing that they would do evil?\\n\\nFurther, why would God create these people, knowing that they would perform evil acts, and that he would have to punish them for all eternity in a torment beyond all possable comprehension?  If God loves us, why would he do this to us?\\n\\nWhat kind of God would tell us that he loves us, and then create us, with complete knowledge that our ultimate goal would be eternity in unimaginable horror?\\n\\nIf we start with the assumption that we have a Good and loving God, for no other kind of God is worth worship, then we must also assume that the Bible passages that tell of him punishing and tormenting us for our actions are flawed, either by misinterpretation of God's word, or to fullfill the purposes of whoever wrote those passages.\\n\\nThis will leave us with only one possable conclusion: that God does not truely hate or intend to punish people for things that they have no control over, or things that they are naturally predisposed to.  For, whether homosexuality is a choice or a fact of an individual's nature, it cannot be argued that the individual's personality is predisposed to homosexuality, for any choice comes from a natural inclination to make that particular choice.\\n\\nThis would leave most of our actions in God's hands, for God, as all knowing, knew every act we would perform in our entire lives before we are even born.  But a person must be held accountable for his actions, and some actions, such as murder, are clearly wrong.\\n\\nWhich brings us around to the possability that God is not all knowing and is as much in the dark about our actions as we are.  This would also open the door for homosexuality being a despised sin that God did not forsee occuring in an individual.\\n\\nPerhaps it's simply not possable to understand all the reasons and thoughts of God, or to truely get a grasp upon which of the Bible teachings are accurate to God's word and which are not.\\n\\nMaybe we can only do the best we can do, being the best person that we can be and hoping that our actions make God happy.\\n\\nThe best person that we can possably be is ourselves, to be somebody else is impossable.  I think that is all God really expects of us.\\n\\nFollow your heart when deciding what is sin and what is not.  And never judge somebody for their actions.  Only those who have never sinned or thought of sinning are worthy to judge.  Maybe some of us are wrong, maybe all of us are wrong, but we simply aren't in the position to decide that.\n\nAnswer:",

For a plane that flew into the ground, Flight 93 left a rather widespread debris field. Investigators found a second debris field three miles away from the main crash site at Indian Lake, and a third debris field in New Baltimore, eight miles away. NTSB officials suggested that the debris at these distant locations blew there in the wind after the crash, but eyewitnesses at Indian Lake saw the debris falling out of the sky like confetti. One of the engines was 600 feet from the main debris field by some accounts and a mile by others. The eyewitness accounts are consistent with a missile strike and not with a plane being flown into the ground. Why will they not release details of what the black box told them? Why did Air Traffic Controllers in a Nashua Telegraph article report an F-16 was circling Flight 93 and was in visual range at the time?\nAnswer: The film \"Flight 93\" will likely follow the media's portrayal of the event. Personally, it's a beautiful story of human courage, but it's simply implausible. All those people getting through on their cell phones? From an altitude of 30,000 feet? With all the conceivable cell phone traffic already on the airwaves generated by the days events? It's preposterous, but I would be well impressed if the forthcoming film would delve into these possibilities.\n\nAnswer:",

(Please don't say excercise, It's ot working for me)\nAnswer: I lost 143 lbs over 7 years ago and have kept it off-and I did it all naturally-no medical intervention! Since I was so overweight all I could do was walk. Forget about hardcore exercise! You need to take a 30min walk every night. Walk as fast as you can handle and move those arms! As far as food, all I did was cut out all fast food, junk food (snacks), soda and juice. Drink only water and unsweetened tea but mainly water!ALOT OF IT! Eat 5-6 times per day but very small meals. For instance here is a typical day back then for me: 6am-1 pack oatmeal and cup hot green tea. 9am- fat free cottage cheese and diced apple 12pm-chicken breast with salsa on top and piece whole grain bread 3pm-very small handful of almonds and raisins 6pm-chicken breast and small side salad with only lettuce tomatoes carrots and a fat free italian dressing. DRINK WATER THRU OUT THE DAY. If your anything like me I used to HATE water but as I made myself drink it- my body craved it! Still does! I am very proud of you for wanting to do this! As you begin to lose weight and fell better you will naturally start to change up your exercise routine as well-you will want the challenge as you begin to feel healthy and strong! At 31 years old now I feel healthier, sexier, and happier than I have ever felt in my whole life and let me tell you... I LOOK GREAT! GOOD LUCK- YOU CAN DO IT!\n\nAnswer:",

Wiccans, Buddhist, even Christianity did not start here in the US, yet they are recognized.\\n\\nIt seems to me that Native American tribes & nations are unliked by the US government.\\n\\nIs that a form of prejudice?\nAnswer: It depends on what you mean by \"recognized.\"\\n\\nIf you mean that a religion is given freedom to be practiced in the USA by anyone who wants to practice it -- then Native American religions are already \"recognized.\"\\n\\nIf you mean that a religion is given some sort of official status by the US government -- well, that never happens.  \\n\\nThe US government never formally sanctions or endorses ANY religion -- the US Constitution prevents it.  \\n\\nIt allows the free practice of any religion, while not officially endorsing or giving special treatment or privilege to any.\n\nAnswer:",

It would be like people hating you for having blue eyes, or for having freckles.\\n\\nIf youre in doubt if feeling a certain way about someone is bad, put yourself in their shoes for a moment.

We derive the van der Waals equation of state, which is an improvement on the ideal gas equation pV=nRT. The ideal gas equation is based on two assumptions: 1. Particles occupy zero volume, and 2. Particles do not interact. Allowing for particles to have a finite size, and also allowing for the fact that at close range, gas particles feel van der Waals attractions, we get the new improved van der Waals equation of state for a gas made of sticky but hard molecules. Van der Waals attractions work because at close range, atoms and molecules notice each other's dipole moments. The dipole moments are due to the fact that at any given instant, the electron cloud is not quite centered on the nucleus of the atom (although it will be centered on average). This instantaneous dipole moment causes atoms in the vicinity to arrange their instantaneous dipoles so as to lower their energy, which causes attraction. \\nIt turns out that geckos can cling to walls and ceilings because of van der Waals attractions. Gecko feet have tiny hairs that split many times to make many very fine tips, giving the hairs a very large total surface area. The fine hairs are able to form many contacts with any surface, and the surface-to-hair contact is adhesive due to van der Waals forces. One gecko foot can support the weight of an entire human.\\nVideo: Sticky gecko feet, and their van der Waals adhesive properties.\n\nAnswer:",

Rills may be faults, possibly caused by ancient tectonic activity or cooling processes.\\n\\nWeathering is indeed done on the moon by the intense Solar Radiation that bombards the lunar surface daily.  Temperatures on the Lunar surface vary widely on location. Although beyond the first few centimeters of the regolith the temperature is a nearly constant -35 C (at a depth of 1 meter), the surface is influenced widely by the day-night cycle. The average temperature on the surface is about 40-45 C lower than it is just below the surface.\\n\\nIn the day, the temperature of the Moon averages 107 C, although it rises as high as 123 C. The night cools the surface to an average of -153 C, or -233 C in the permanently shaded south polar basin. A typical non-polar minimum temperature is -181 C (at the Apollo 15 site).\\n\\nThe Lunar temperature increases about 280 C from just before dawn to Lunar noon.  Average temperature also changes about 6 C betwen aphelion and perihelion.  Meaning the closest and furthest the moon comes to; and far away it gets from the sun.\\n\\nLunar Temperature Differences\\nhttp://www.asi.org/adb/m/03/05/average-temperatures.html\\n\\nLunar Soil\\nhttp://epsc.wustl.edu/admin/resources/meteorites/regolith_breccia.html\\n\\nLunar Regolith and Fragmental Breccias\\n\\nRegolith is the name given to the layer of unconsolidated material at the surface of a planet \u2013 the loose stuff that overlies the solid rock.

Speak with friends and family members who you really trust because they maybe able to refer you to someone. They can give you some insight. Also when speaking with a realtor make for sure that they take the time to explain to you EVERYTHING. Once you sign the contract , there is no changing your mind. It is always good to speak with someone who has had many years in this field. There are so many people who have built homes and are turning around and selling them but, aren't experts in the field of real estate. That is only one area of it.

I roll my neck constantly. Could this be bad? How can i stop or at least try doing it less? Help me please!\nAnswer: There is nothing wrong with cracking your neck.  There is still some speculation with what it is actually doing, but most have concluded that it is simply releasing the carbon dioxide (or some other sort of gas) that is built up between your vertebrae.  The only thing I would suggest would be not to force it.  If you are cracking your neck, don't force to crack if it won't.  It could damage something.  \\n\\nCracking your neck can be helpful too.  It reduces stress in the neck, if done properly.  The reduce of stress can result in less headaches.  I'm sure if you go to your local chiropractor, he/she could tell you more about it.\n\nAnswer:",

Recently, a friend was very blunt with me, telling me that more than half of the campus can't stand me, that I'm so annoying, that I ask too many questions, I can be rude to others, and that I try too hard to fit in. However, I see myself as a nice person, and I try very hard to be sensitive to others' needs. I'll admit I do ask many questions - but I didn't realize I was that bad. What she said really hurts, and I have tried so hard over the years to improve myself, but I seem to have failed, and I feel like I'm at a dead end. I have lost many of my friends lately and I just feel so lost. Any suggestions on how to lessen being annoying, and make good friends? Any good conversation topics? I have been from hell to back, and I just want to be happy and have a good / best friend, but I haven't been able to achieve that yet.\\n\\nThanks. I really appreciate it. :)\nAnswer: From what I can decipher from your writing, you seem like a well-spoken, educated, sympathetic individual.  Though you seem to care greatly about what this 'friend' thinks, she doesn't seem to care that much about your feelings.  'Bluntly' exclaiming that half the school dislikes you is a gross exaggeration and extremely rude.  Try to distance yourself from her as she isn\u2019t offering constructive support.\\n\\nI think everyone on this earth can be annoying at times.  Improving yourself is great, but try not to be too hard on yourself!  I'm in college too, and I find that it's hard to make close, lasting friendships.  Don't be discouraged.  Try joining clubs that interest you.  There, you'll find other people with similar interests, and that makes it really easy to talk to them.  You could also do an on-campus work-study where you interact with all kinds college people.\\n\\nBut if you still think you want more social help, try the self-help section at any large bookstore.  There are tons of information out there.  Believe me, you're not the only one who has troubles about this kind of stuff; I know all too well but this kind of stress.  \\n\\nAs for a personal suggestion, I tend to imitate people I admire.  I note how they act or react in particular situations and I end up trying it myself.  I, also, do \"small talk\".  Just by asking general questions like (\"what are you majoring in\" or \"own any pets\") I try to find their interests and look interested at the same time.\\n\\nHope this helps!\n\nAnswer:",

I have seen patients with that sort of heart rate and it feels like the pulse is vibrating rather than beating.  Even with a stethoscope it was impossible to count the heart rate.  Only with the use of EKG equipment did we get an actual accounting of the heart rate.  Secondly it is very unlikely that your heart is beating like that and you are not symptomatic in any way (lightheadedness, shortness of breath, nearly passing out, chest pain).  I'm not saying it couldn't happen but it doesn't exactly add up.  \\n\\nADDENDUM:  You say you are getting 64 beats in 15 seconds - as I said above, I have tried to take someone's pulse whose heart was moving that fast and could not discern a pulse.  At that rate your heart does not have time to fill with blood to even produce a full pulse.\\n\\nThe EKG's you had were static, that is you were not moving.  You do need a work up by a cardiologist.  There is a test called a tilt table that can replicate the action of you bending over while you are hooked up to the monitoring equipment.  I would bet this is a supraventricular tachycardia.  If it is there is a procedure - ablation therapy - that can complete cure the problem for life without medication.  Until then there are medications that can control the rate.

It was then that I realized how much time I wasted and how addictive it was so I closed my account that same day.  All of my friends are on it and are telling me to get it since many of them are either graduating from college this year or go to schools in other states and say it helps to keep in touch.

So how did it reach earth surface?\nAnswer: Tectonic movements (earthquakes), volcanic action, and erosion.  \\n\\n1. Tectonic movements -- As the various plates that make up the Earth's surface move around, some crash into each other and one is forced up over the other.  Thus, for example, Himalayas.  The rocks that were deep underground are forced up near the surface.\\n\\n2. Volcanoes spew out lava which forms igneous rocks, but certain kinds of explosions will toss out large chunks of metamorphic rock from deep underground as well.\\n\\n3.  Erosion is primarily responsible for most of what we see as the surface of the Earth. While the other two actions will bring the rock near the surface, the action of wind and water removes the top layers of dirt and lighter rock.  Most significant is the action of glaciers, which strip everything down to the bare rock -- this is, I believe, why you find granite near the surface in New Hampshire.\n\nAnswer:",

Together with the recently identified IMMUTANS protein, a homologue of the alternative oxidase of mitochondria, one role of the Ndh complex may be to participate in a chlororespiratory electron transfer pathway . Additionally Ndh may play a role in cyclic electron flow around photosystem one.\\n\\n2-Evidence is presented to substantiate a chloroplastic respiratory pathway in the green alga, Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, whereby reducing equivalents generated during the degradation of starch enter the thylakoidal chain at the plastoquinone site catalyzed by NADH-plastoquinone reductase. In this formulation, the reduced plastoquinone is oxidized either by the photoevolution (photosystem I) of H2 under anaerobic conditions or by O2 during dark respiration.\n\nAnswer:",

A digital video (DV) camcorder, for example, is a video camera that captures and stores images on a digital medium such as a DAT.....The history of digital video can be helpful in understanding the background of the technology that has had to evolve in order to produce quality reproductions of sound and images. The development of electronic reproduction of sound began at the end of the nineteenth century with the invention of the telephone. By the beginning of the twentieth century, the invention of the phonograph and radio had expanded the applications of electronic sound.\\n\\nAfter World War II, electronic motion pictures were found in people's homes through the invention of television. Television used analog technology to produce these pictures with sound. Analog technology requires information representing images and sound to be in a real-time continuous-scale electric signal between sources and receivers. Analog systems have become highly developed and widely used today.\\n\\nHowever, digital technology has also become widely used and a cost effective technology. Its roots also go back to the early nineteenth and early twentieth century. Digital technology is the representation of data by a fixed number of discrete points. Originally digital technology was developed for the purpose electronic computation. After World War II, digital computers were available, but they were expensive and difficult to use. This was true until the 1960's when solid state integrated circuits were developed. With this development, computing costs dropped, and computing speed and reliability increased, as well as the use of computers.\\n\\nWith the millions of televisions and VCRs in use today and the commonality of the personal computer, the merging of the controllability of personal computers with the quality images of television was inevitable. This merger can best be described as an evolution of computers and television technology which have united to produce interactive digital video.\n\nAnswer:",

I get little spots (that are only noticable when I itch and the area turns red). I went to my doctor who told me it is shaving rash, which is possibly true because the itching always starts a day after I shave my legs and usually stops when the hairs have re-grown. He prescribed me anti-histamines but the itchiness returned when I finished the pills. I went back and he said there is not much he can do except prescribe more anti-histamines and also suggested that I try another method of hair removal. I have tried hair removal creams but they make my legs feel like they are on fire. I do not want to wax my legs so please do not suggest that anyone, and nor do i want to go to salons for treatment. Does anyone have any suggestions to get rid of the itchiness. I use emulsifying ointment when I wash and I also apply aqeuous cream after shaving - although they have helped a bit I still itch quite a lot\nAnswer: it might be an allergy, i have a nickle allergy, and nickle is in the blade of razors, i itch just like you,in fact it was really bad earlier tonight, i find it helps to put a cold, wet flannel or towel on my legs, it calms it down, my doctor sent me to the hospital for tests and thats how i found out i was allergic to nickel, itchy legs also affect me at \"that\" time of the month,no cream works for me, try the doctor again and ask for an allergy test, good luck\n\nAnswer:",

Is sound the reception of sound waves or the creation of sound ways? Hmmm...\nAnswer: Never mind. No question is a stupid question as long as u learn from it. Here's my explanation. Where does sound come from? Sound is actually produced by vibration. As long as it has vibration, it produces sound, no matter how loud or how soft. Even molecules in a solid produces sound because it vibrates, but we can't hear the sound because it is out of our hearing range. Well, as you asked, when a tree falls, it actually vibrates, hence, sound is actuallly produced although we can't hear it. For your second question, IF, lets say you are in the woods and happen to see the tree fall, and you can hear the sound of the fall of the tree. Your question was, how on earth you heard that sound, right? Here's the explanation. When the tree falls, it vibrates. When it vibrates, energy is transfered to the air. The air molecule will then vibrate and the so-called sound wave will then be transmitted into your ears.\n\nAnswer:",

Assuming you have windows XP, you need to delete the existing partition and create a new one. After that you can format it and use it like any other hard drive.  To delete/create partitions, you need to go into the control panel -> administrative tools -> computer management -> disk management. Then select the xbox drive, then delete the existing partition, then create a new one - either NTFS or FAT32. Then format it.  The xbox drives are very small - why bother? ;-)\n\nAnswer:",

Why is the mountain guarded?\nQuestion: I mean, there are people all over the world who have climbed Mt. Everest, but Mt. Ararat is unattainable?? Are there religious fanatics and crooks who don't want us to find out the truth, that nothing of the sort (noahs ark) exists?\nAnswer: Well, I think it's more politics that keep people from climbing Mt. Ararat, as it is in a politically volatile region. I'm sure the local gov't. doesn't want a bunch of religious loonies clambering around in their mountains, leaving trash everywhere and trying to find some non-existent boat. Of course, that doesn't stop Christians from believing any old thing they read about it.\\n\\nPlease, people, for once, think about the logistics of it. A boat that huge, made entirely of wood, COULD NOT survive an ocean voyage--it would collapse under its own weight, to say nothing of tons of cargo!  You cannot fit thousands upon thousands of animals onto a ship that size. There was almost no ventilation, except for tiny windows up at the top. Hello, FUMES, ANYONE?? Could 8 people keep up with the crap from thousands of animals? Where was it disposed of? Where did they keep food for that many animals? \\n\\nWhat about plant life? No, most seeds do not survive brackish water.  What about the fish? With few exceptions, they are adapted to either fresh or salt water, not both. \\n\\nWhat about animals that are so highly adapted to a specific environment that they die if taken out of it? Everglade kites feed exclusively on a specific type of snail, for which their beaks are adapted perfectly. Where did Noah get both the kites AND the snails?? Koalas and eucalyptus trees? Pandas and bamboo? Hummingbirds and various trumpet-shaped flowers?  Roadrunners and lizards? Egg-eating snakes and the eggs they feed on? Vultures and carrion? And then, how did he get them all back where they belong?  Good grief, this story is so silly that I can't believe anyone in the 21st century still takes it literally.\n\nAnswer:",

Sentence 2 is more on the order of a simple statement about what will be accomplished (or completed) at the moment the next ten minutes have passed. Again the difference between the two sentences is very subtle.\\n\\nI think there is a fundamental problem which this question illustrates quite well. That problem is this: You are being instructed in the rules of formal English grammar from a textbook. But these are not necessarily the forms that (most) English-speaking peoples use in their everyday conversation. \\n\\nI think it more likely that one would say (at least here in the U.S.):\\n\\n1-By ten minutes from now you will have finished reading this.\\nor\\n1-By the time ten minutes are up you will have finished reading this.\\n\\nor\\n\\n1-By the time ten minutes have passed you will be done reading this.\\n\\nI like the third way best. It is simple and clear. There are other ways to say the same thing besides these three. These are just some of the more common examples.\\n\\nYou see the problem though. If you use the form I am suggesting here then you are not studying the future perfect tense. But again there is to my mind something lacking in the method of instruction here. I can guarantee you that NO ONE speaking English as a primary language stops to think, \"Shall I use future perfect tense her or just future?\" It just isn't done. EVER. I had totally forgotten that a tense called future perfect even existed until you called my attention to it again. And this would be the case with most any native speaker who has completed school and pays little attention to rules of grammar. Still we get along and make ourselves understood. The point further is that I think the third example I gave above is easier to understand.\\n\\nSo that leaves you with a very real dilemma. On the one hand you must learn the formal rules of English grammar from the textbooks as your instructor(s) want you to. But on the other hand, you'd also like to learn how English is actually spoken and written by native users, wouldn't you?\\n\\nNow, back to your second sentence. It might be said the way you have it. Sure. But you are more likely to hear something like\\n\\n2-In ten minutes you will finish reading this.\\n\\nor\\n\\n\\n2-Ten minutes from now you will finish reading this. \\n\\nWell I have had my say and I'm afraid I may just have confused you more. Just keep this in mind: there is the English of formal grammar on the one hand and on the other, the English as it is actually used by the users. In the very long view (generations or even centuries) the second determines the first.\n\nAnswer:",

Exit interviews are designed to do two things.  Sometimes three.\\n\\n1.  If you are a valued employee and leaving voluntarily, they may try to make you a counter-offer and get you to change your mind about leaving.  People disagree as to whether it is a good idea to accept a counter-off once you have decided to leave.  Conventional wisdom says that you shouldn't but there are exceptions to every rule.\\n\\n2. But the primary purpose of an exit interview is collect your ID badge, your key if you have one, laptops or cell phones if you have those, to discuss how much you will be paid out for unused vacation time, etc.  If the termination is involuntary you'll be told about any outplacement services they are offering you, any severance that you will be getting, how and when you'll be able to apply for COBRA insurance coverage, etc.  If you are being given severance or outplacement services, you may be asked to sign an agreement that you will not sue them for anything.\\n\\n3.  Some companies that are more concerned about having a positive workplace and retaining their valued employees will ask questions about why you are leaving.  These aren't intended to put you on the spot, but to learn why people leave so they know what they need to tackle in order for more people to stay.  A - these interviews should never be given by the company itself, there should always be a 3rd party who will keep your information confidential and B) be VERY VERY careful here.  If the bridge behind you isn't totally burned already, don't burn it here.  Their need for this information is far secondary for your possible need to return to the company, to get references from people, to network with them in the future, etc.  So even if the reason you are leaving is that your boss is a horse's butt, I would never say that.  I would always just say that you found another opportunity that you feel you have to take for your career, and that it has been such a pleasure, and you really value the culture and the people here, its been a good place to work, blah blah blah, but that right now you really have to go do X.  Never whine, never complain, etc.  My feeling about exit interviews is that if companies aren't in tune enough with their work environment to know why people are leaving, exit interviews are not going to solve their problem.  And your first and only responsibility at this point is to yourself.\n\nAnswer:",

It's commonly believed that the cause of psychedelic \"flashbacks\" is LSD that remains in the spinal cord.  In fact, LSD is completely excreted in the urine within a day or two.  Flashbacks are a completely psychological phenomenon.  The only substances that will remain in the body permanently are heavy metals (lead, lithium, gold, etc.).  \\n\\nHaving said that, LSD does bind to serotonin receptors in the spinal cord and brain, and can permanently damage these receptors.  While this is unlikely to occur with a single use, it's certainly a good idea NOT to damage your brain.\n\nAnswer:",

Is it cost effective?  That's a better question.  Consider the job market where you live?  Is there a need for such?  Will you require furthering your education to keep your job?  Are you willing to move to get a job in another location?  Automotive technology is constantly changing.  You'll be studying in that field for the rest of your career.  If you enjoy it, you can earn a living at it.  You'll probably never become independently wealthy as a technician.  But you will be doing something you enjoy.  That is a great plus.  Diesel is a good one also.  My uncle does that.  He mostly works on tractors, but does other diesels as well.  Sometimes he works on other engines.  Unless your job requires the question, \"Do you want fries with that\", you'll always be learning.\n\nAnswer:",

The truth is they were only very distantly related, and certainly had never met before the former's rise to prominence. The closest relationship that has been identified for them is 19th cousins once removed. It has also been claimed that Audrey chose the last name Hepburn in honor of Katharine when she became an actress; however, the record shows that it was part of her family name for some time before she entered show business.\n\nAnswer:",

If you need any more information, try googling \"Brian Greene.\" He was not the first to develop string theory, but he was the first to explain it in lay terms. Or, checkout his book, \"The Elegant Universe,\" from the library. It's really an easy read.\\n\\nBasically, parallel universes explain why gravity is so weak compared to the other forces of nature \u2013 electromagnetism, the weak nuclear force, and the strong nuclear force. It is suggested that gravity is weak because it travels between parallel universes. So, as Brian Greene suggests, it may be possible to \u201ctalk\u201d to aliens in parallel universes using gravity waves. Gravity waves were predicted by Einstein, but no one has discovered them\u2026yet.\\n\\nSo far as aliens, if you are referring to green men from Mars, no one has found any hint of intelligent life. So far as alien bacteria, there have been a handful of claims of alien bacteria inside metorites, but these claims have been met with skepticism.\n\nAnswer:",

Does it take long to aclamate to the humid climate? We are looking at property w/ in a 30 mile radius of Nashville> Somewhere fun and safe for teenagers. Any info would ber apreciated. Thanks.\nAnswer: I was raised in Nashville.  I still live in middle Tennessee, but now I\u2019m about 70 miles from Nashville.\\n\\nIt does get pretty humid at times here in middle Tennessee.  There are some days that seem almost intolerable, but mostly it\u2019s hardly noticeable, especially once you get acclimated.  As far as how long it would take a person to get accustomed to this humid climate, I can\u2019t tell you, because I\u2019ve always been here.  In so far as the bugs and snakes are concerned, I would think that they are no more copious or intrusive then any other place.  The only \u201cnatural disasters\u201d that would occur in this area come from the storms that we have occasionally.  Damage could come from hail, lightning or tornados.\\n\\nA good place to set up residence outside of Nashville is in Wilson County.  It\u2019s just East of Nashville on Interstate 40 and includes the towns of Mt Juliet and Lebanon.  Lebanon is about 20 miles from Nashville.\\n\\nI hope this has been helpful.\n\nAnswer:",

Browse through the listings and see if you can find any grant that would support your purposes.\\n\\nEven if you buy books on \"how to get grants\" or list that supposedly has information on grants -- all of them are mere rehash of what CFDA has, albeit packaged differently.\\n\\nNote though that these grants generally support non-profit organizations, intermediary lending institutions, and state and local governments. Most of the federal grants are given to specific target groups with specific requirements (e.g. minority business owners involved in transportation related contracts emanating from DOT - Grant#20.905 Disadvantaged Business Enterprises Short Term Lending Program. Individuals especially for personal purposes are not eligible for federal grants. \\n\\nGrants are also often given to non profit groups or organizations involved in training or other similar activities (grant 59.043 Women's Business Ownership Assistance that are given to those who will create women's business center that will train women entrepreneurs \\n\\nThe government is NOT in the business of giving away free money for the sake of giving away money. Grants are free, but it means OBLIGATION. You will be obligated to do as the grant sets out to do. Grants have objectives, and your purpose must fit the objective of the grant.\\n\\nFor one, you have to write the grant application and the grant application is not a simple document - you have to explain how your purpose for applying for the grant fits well with the objectives set out by the grant. Grants have objectives, and the grant applications that best captures the grant's objectives are approved.\\n\\nThere is a stringent review process through a committee composed of federal employees and selected experts in the field. You will compete with other applicants for the grant money, and this grant review committee will evaluate the merits of each proposal. Only those that they feel exemplifies the objective of the grant will be approved.\n\nAnswer:",

So what (if anything) was there before the big bang,  Dark matter? If it was an empty void, then a sphere would seem likely,  but if some form of energy or matter pre-exsisted would it not help in the forming of the shape of the universe?\nAnswer: Actually we don't even know enough about the shape of the Universe to affirm that the Universe is infinite or not.\\n\\nSuppose we put an ant on a infinite sheet of paper. The ant is short-sighted and sees only that close to him his universe look pretty flat. If he starts walking he will never meet a boundary and never come back to the same place again. The two-dimensional plane is infinite and without bounds.\\n\\nNext put the ant on a large sphere. Again our ant can not see far enough to observe any curvature. If he starts walking in one direction he will never come to a boundary, but this time he can make a roundtrip. The spherical universe is unbounded but finite.\\n\\nWe are in the same position as the ant, but in three dimensions. Locally our Universe seems flat and unbounded, but we don't know if we are in the 3 dimensional equivalent of the plane or the sphere. In the first case the Universe would be infinite, in the second place it would be finite.\\n\\nNow the fun and speculation starts....\\nEven weirder shapes are possible. In two dimensions our ant has a third possibility, a universe shaped as a torus or a donut. We can make a torus by taking a sheet of paper, roll it up in a cylinder and then glue the two open ends together.\\nThe torus also has a three dimensional equivalent. Take a cube and imagine the following rule: everytime we leave the cube-universe through a side, we immediately enter it again to the side opposite. It is as if the opposing sides are glued together.\\n\\nStrange? Yes, but not excluded...\\n\\nMy current favourite shape for the Universe is the following. Think of *two* three dimensional spheres. We live inside one of the spheres. A spaceship that flies to the boundary of one sphere immediately reappears on the corresponding point on the boundary of the other sphere and continues its voyage there. It is as if the boundaries of the two spheres are somehow glued together.\\n\\nNeat, isn't it?\n\nAnswer:",

Youre cute but you just need to lose some weight. Honestly, I dont think Im fat. My measurments are 42-30-38 (my butt is big). Why cant nice, healthy size girls get some love too?\nAnswer: Truthfully speaking, I believe most men are attracted to women with curves, but they are afraid to admit it, as if it were illegal to do so. You see society predicates what is beautiful, and honey we aint it!, and that's a shame, because the average woman is a size 14.\\n\\nSociety needs to reconfigure its idea of beauty, and realize that \"REAL WOMEN HAVE CURVES\" not every man wants a twiggy. Society views a woman with curves to be overweight, and she may not be, there is nothing wrong with being healthy and having some junk in your trunk too. Most men dont want a bone, most men want meat on their bones, you know what I mean!\\n\\nI wish that us thick girls could get some love too, just like our thinner counterparts. I guess guys are afraid of what others will think, as a matter of fact I have a male friend that is attracted to thick women, and all his friends tell him he's a chubby chaser, now that is just not fair, but he doesnt care, he tells them they dont know what their missing, but you can see where I'm going with this, his friends are the equivilent of how society views us thick girls, and that is just so sad, because we are the majority not the minority!\\n\\nHowever I am feeling confident that slowly but surely societies ideals of us is changing, thanks to people like Mo'Nique and Toccara, they are starting to break down some barriers.\\n\\nI hope my answer, as long as it is, was helpful to you.

While I am more computer savvy than the average person, as far as any type of programming goes, I am basically ignorant, and would like to learn in the very least, enough to host this game. I've been poking around the web, but I'm not quite sure where to start. Any direction would be greatly appreciated!\nAnswer: Hi there! Welcome to the world of PHP. Hosting a web application shouldn't be that difficult. I had a quick look at the project, and it comes bundled in a .tar.gz (packaged for tape, then run through a compression program called gzip) archive. This means that first and foremost, you'll need a utility to unzip these files. If you're on Mac or Linux, you've got it, if on Windows, use this:\\n\\nhttp://www.sfsu.edu/ftp/win/utils/\\n\\nSo unpack it, and examine the source code. Read its README file, and any other documentation you can find. Now you're ready to put it online. Since I've never installed it, I can't say exactly how it will go, but I can recommend a place to put it:\\n\\nhttp://www.powweb.com\\n\\nThis site offers hosting (with PHP and MySQL, which this app probably uses) for $7.77 per month.\\n\\nBest of luck!\n\nAnswer:",

The issues the amendment deals with, however, is.\\n\\nMost of our entire codification of laws and judicial system is based on morals. It is immoral to murder. It is immoral to rape. It is immoral to kidnap. I think we all agree that these crimes are wrong both legally and morally.\\n\\nThere are plenty of issues of morality that the law deals with that we might agree on. In several states, sodomy is illegal. Drug use is illegal. Minors buying tobacco is illegal. Are these issues morally wrong? A good debate with arguments from each side could be made.\\n\\nOn to Constitutional amendments. The Constitution creates and protects our beliefs as a country. Amendment 13 bans slavery. Amendment 14 banned ex-Conferates from holding national office. Article 18 banned alcohol in the US and Article 21 repealed it. All of these amendments (and many more) deal with moral issues that we, as a society, have decided are either right or wrong.\\n\\nConstitutional amendment are designed to deal with more specific issues rather than broad issues, and the specific areas you discuss are prime areas for a Constitutional amendment. That is why is it so important that the country has intelligent discourse from citizens involved in the political process. Find out about the issue, make up your mind, and fight for what you believe is right.\n\nAnswer:",

Each player is assigned either the white or yellow ball as his own cue ball. A point is scored when the shooter caroms on both red balls. The shooter is penalized a point if he fails to carom on either red ball or if the shooter causes any ball to carom on his opponent's cue ball. Thus, the shooter must avoid any carom of his opponent's ball while striving to carom on the two red object balls. A carom on only one red ball results in no points but ends the shooter's inning.\n\nAnswer:",

If you decide to go on reserve how much would you make?\nAnswer: First, you can't just decide to go on reserve.  Once your active enlistment is up, you can then enlist to serve in the reserves.  Reserve pay is dependent upon the number of drills you take part in.  If you are making 30k a year, you would have to be at least the rank of Sergeant (E-5) and have spent 8 years or more in the service. The same grade and time in service would net you about $330 for a weekend's worth of drill before taxes.\n\nAnswer:",

Before I say anything, I should point out that I am not an attorney and this is not legal advice. Unfortunately, the situation with AllofMP3 is, like many things, too good to be true. Whatever licenses or loopholes the site claims to have in Russia (which I would take with multiple grains of salt... or shots of vodka?), they don't extend to a U.S. citizen who downloads the content inside the U.S. That's where the copying takes place, and that's where the parties have to have a license to make copies. If they don't (and they don't), then you could be in trouble if the files were found on your computer. One interesting extra-legal thing to consider is that it's harder for the RIAA to get the names of people who use AllofMP3 in order to prosecute them, but that may not be true forever.

How were the obstacles elliminated?\\n\\n\\nB. Why was the completion of this massive project which took ten years to build such a big deal when it finally opened?\nAnswer: A. Various diseases hampered the construction project because many people died.  Yellow fever and Malaria were the most deadly of them, because before the cause of them was discovered (mosquitoes) they didn't know how to treat the disease.\\n\\nAlso the original French plan called for a sea level canal like Suez.  Unfortunately for the French the Panamanian landscape didn't allow them to dig so easily as they did in Suez, and the technology they were using in Panama was the same one as they used in Suez, which was all wrong.\\n\\nWhen the US got the rights to build the canal arising from the Hay - Buneau Varilla treat of 1903, they reengineered the plans and decided to go for a lock type canal, rather than a sea level canal.  They based this on a prior study from a French engineer.  They also brought new technology with them, for example Concrete.  Remember we're talking about 1903 here.\\n\\nAlso the US got a hold of the research that a Cuban medic called Carlos Finlay did on Yellow Fever where he discovered that mosquitoes were the vectors causing the disease, and the incubation time needed for the mosquitoes to transfer the disease.\\n\\nWith that the US drained swamps, and they fumigated the entire Canal Zone, along with the Panamanian Cities of Cristobal, Colon and Panama to get rid of the mosquitoes.\\n\\nB. Actually it wasn't a big deal when the Canal opened in 1914.  It was the smallest story on the front page news.  Remember WWI just broke out in Europe, so the news from the battlefront were more interesting than the first transit of the canal.  By the way it was done by the Steamship Ancon.\\n\\nNow regarding commerce and the military advantage it gave the US, it was a big deal.  Ships could now shorten the time it took them to go around the Cape of Horns in South America, and also for those ships that had to cross the Cape of Good Hope in South Africa.  The US military could complement their fleets just crossing some vessels through the Canal.  Think about all the savings it brought to commerce, and the possibilites to the military strategists at that time.\\n\\nAlso until 1977 the Panama Canal was controlled by the US Military, not the US Federal Government as some still think.  The office handling the Panama Canal affairs was in the Pentagon, not the Secretary of Commerce.  After 1977 with the new Panama Canal Treaties (they were 3 treaties in one single body) The Neutrality Treaty declared the Panama Canal neutral in all times of wars and crisis, therefore now any ship couldn't be denied the right to go through the Panama Canal.  Although I don't believe that prior to 1977 the US actually denied transit except in WWII for obvious reasons.\n\nAnswer:",

They do it because somebody talks them into believing that after they commit their atrocity they will go to heaven and get 72 virgins to rape at their pleasure.  The 9/11 hijackers were all Saudis and Egyptians -- nobody took their land.  And the Palestinians who strap bombs to their children initially did it because Saadam Hussein offered $25,000 to any family whose child became a suicide bomber.  After Saadam was deposed, Hamas took over the job of rewarding the families of suicide bombers.  It is a horrible, nihilistic practice that strikes at the very heart of civilization.  It is human sacrifice.  The Muslim world should rise up and smash this death cult, and the fact that they don't makes for a strong argument that Islam needs serious reform.\n\nAnswer:",

Also, the religious fundamentalists have hijacked the Republican Party, and as far as I'm concerned, they have no f**king right to tell me or anyone else how to live.

He wants us to come up with some ideas for them, then we are going to make them in Powerpoint.  \\n\\nWe may be doing one with some techniques on them on how to do titrations, and some other things.\\n\\nThe other guy thought of a Do's and Dont's poster, but im not entirely sure what all we would put on that.\\n\\nI will probably go through all the labs we had done earlier in the year again and try to find some things, and we may make one that shows some safety things like the fume hood, shower, eye wash exc.\\n\\nAnyone have any more ideas of something that would be good for a chem lab?  Its basic college chem 1 and 2.\nAnswer: Here's a do/don't:  when smelling a chemical, don't just stick your nose over it, like you would smell something in everyday life.  Hold the test-tube, flask, etc, away from your face, and waft some of the fumes toward your nose with your hand.  Then, if it's not really nasty, you can smell some more in the normal way.\\n\\nAnother:  When inserting a glass tube into a cork or stopper, first be  sure you make the edges rounded by polishing it with a bunsen burner.  Then be sure to lubricate it.  Glycerine is normally used for that, though spit can be effective when the former isn't available.  If you don't do these things, the tube won't go in easily, and can break and jab you.  That happened to me when I was a kid.  It made a pretty bad gash in my finger.\\n\\nFor all you pyros out there ;) : Never grind an oxidizer and fuel together.

In other words, wind travels counterclockwise around low pressure zones in the Northern Hemisphere. It is approximately true in the higher latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere, and is reversed in the Southern Hemisphere, but the angle between barometric gradient and wind is not a right angle in low latitudes. See Coriolis effect#Flow around a low-pressure area.\"\\n...does Buys-Ballot's law have anything to do with why toilets flush counterclockwise in the northern hemisphere and clockwise in the southern hemisphere?

I am not lacking social or scholastic skills. There are some challenges when it gets to high school, but for the most part it isn't that bad. I am going to public school next year, but I have no problem with homeschooling. It obviously has some to do with how your children learn, how much time you have to teach them, how much they can do on their own, and certain factors like that. It also takes much patience. Good Luck!\\n\\nP.S. I don't know where some people are getting their facts, but it's not true that kids in public school do better than those in homeschool. I have heard from many people and websites that the exact opposite is true. On my last standardized test, I got post high-school grades on all subjects, and I'm only in 9th grade.\n\nAnswer:",

I called to ask if there were mild stomach flus going around.  I've been having problems with nausea, some vomiting, queasiness, especially when I think about most foods, stomach pain, and difficulty burping.  I also have a lot of low back pain but that may be unrelated.  When my stomach hurts I sometimes lay down and apply a bit of pressure to my stomach and diaphragm.  They feel quite hard.  \\n\\nMy doctor tells me that problems with the gallbladder can run a whole range of symptoms from mild to severe attacks.  Does anyone have some info. that you could share with me?  The online sites I've been to don't really cover the range of severity.  I have to wait another month for my ultrasound.  That seems excessively long to me.  That's our universal healthcare system for you.\nAnswer: Risk factors:\\nBeing overweight \\nAge- older than 65 \\nFatty diet \\nGenetics \\nBeing a Native American or Hispanic \\nHaving sickle cell anemia \\nCrash dieting \\n\\nSince obesity is so closely linked, maintaining a normal weight is an important, especially for women. Avoiding high-fat meals and \"yo-yo\" weight-loss diets are also good ideas. If your background places you at high risk, avoid taking birth control pills or estrogen.\\n\\nIf your doctor thought that your attacks were on the severe side, or life threatening, he would have you in for an ultrasound immediately.  Try avoiding any fatty or sugary foods at least until you get in.\n\nAnswer:",

Then, last night, I get a response from her saying, \"Just letting you know i shipped your item.  This is just a friendly reminder\".  WHAT does that mean??

If i did not purchase shipping insurance (have never had a problem like this before) can I do anything to get my money back???\nAnswer: Did the seller respond to your last email? \\n\\nContact Paypal. If the seller cannot provide proof of delivery, then Paypal will issue you a refund--from the seller's account. \\n\\nIf there is a tracking number or a delivery confirmation number, you can tell when the package was shipped, maybe she just shipped it a couple of days ago.  \\n\\nIf you leave her negative feedback, most likely she'll leave negative feedback for you too, so I'd think about that one.

You must ask yourself what grounds you are basing your conclusion on. If you see her once a year then there must be some sort of relationship between the two of you.

So if you really want to know (what she will do) - figure out a way to know. Maybe you could ask her if she would be willing to talk to you about something that's been on your mind.

A player is allowed to lift his heel, but his toes and the ball of his foot must remain fully planted, so that they are only \"pivoting\" or swiveling around, without moving to another position on the floor.\\n\\nIn the NBA, the traveling rule is probably the rule most frequently violated without being called.

The word \"capacitance\" has as its root the word \"capacity\" -- capacitance is the capacity an object has to hold electrons. The lamp, when standing by itself on a table, has a certain capacitance. This means that if a circuit tried to charge the lamp with electrons, it would take a certain number to \"fill it.\" When you touch the lamp, your body adds to its capacity. It takes more electrons to fill you and the lamp, and the circuit detects that difference. It is even possible to buy little plug-in boxes that can turn any lamp into a touch-sensitive lamp. They work on the same principle.\n\nAnswer:",

But still no idea what does it mean.  \\n\\nCould someone please teach me how to use the sentence?\nAnswer: It's really quite simple. In a buyer's market where there are multiple goods on sale from a variety of retailers then you could wander around until you found the article that you want at the cheapest price or even barter if retailers are desperate for business due to competition.\\n\\nHowever the saying is not derived from this. It's a reference to the choices you make in life and the consequences of those choices. Thus making the choice is your decision provided that you accept, when making that choice, that there may be repercussions at some future time from taking that path.\\n\\nAn example could be deciding to drop out of college to take a job as, say, a shop assistant. In the short term you may think that it's a good choice because you suddenly have money to spend and, to your friends, an increase in status due to you working rather than going to college. However some way down the line when they have all graduated and got better jobs than you it becomes apparent that you may have made a wrong decision since they will now earn more than you and have a higher status. If there is no way back it could be said that 'you paid your money and took your choice' with unfortunate results.\n\nAnswer:",

Do you think it exists in western society?\nAnswer: White privilege means the attitude of a certain group of people in the Caucasian race that go through life without recognizing that they have an air of entitlement about them as they move through life.  A perfect example:  My son and I were at a mall,  he opened the door for me and two Caucasian women, talking to each other, pushed through in front of me, without acknowledging him.  He looked at me and just shook his head.  Another time, a man walked up as I was dealing with a customer service agent in a Cingular store and proceeded to tell the agent his issue.  He became very rude when I explained that I was not only there conducting business as he walked up, but that he needed to get in line behind the other 15 people that he had stepped in front of.  He proceeded to tell me how out of line I was and that he was 'just' asking the agent one or two questions.  I explained to him a little more forcefully that he was not the only one with questions, and needed to wait his turn.  He was so out done he actually left the store.  I've experienced this type of behavior over 50 years in various states, so these are not isolated incidents.\\n\\nThis is not about slavery or being \"owed a living by the government\".  This is about being treated as a piece of the woodwork, about people talking about you while you are in the room as though you are not in the room saying things that are offensive and ignorant.  This is about people treating you as though you are invisible which you are to them, stepping in front of you in line, demanding to be served first in a restaurant because their time is more important than yours, walking into you and not saying excuse me but saying excuse me to the white woman behind you that they did the same thing to.  Yes, it is rude, but it is also an attitude of I am better than you and I deserve what I get because I was born to it and I don't give it a second thought.  It's about bringing up slavery, when no one was even mentioning  or thinking of slavery.\n\nAnswer:",

When a meteor actually hits Earth, it is called a meteorite.\\n\\nLuckily for us, meteorites hitting Earth isnt too common any more (we will ocassionally get a few big ones), usually they burn up harmlessly, or land far off away from anything.  There have been instances of meteorites actually crashing through people's houses or hitting cars, but this is extreamly rare.  Even more rare indeed are large meteorite impacts, like the one that is theorized to have killed of the dinosaurs or the \"meteor crater\" impact site, these only happen once in a few million years.\n\nAnswer:",

Any special diet?  Thank you!?\nAnswer: I've tried everything I can to no avail.  I have two patches that refuse to go away.  They'll subside a bit, then flare up with a vengeance.  Sunlight and artificial sunlight may help.  Cortisone creams (Rx from Doc - the OTC stuff doesn't help).  Keep applying good lotions -- that seems to help fight off the plaque build-up. Warm showers and baths.\\n\\nVitamins, supplements, diet and lifestyle -- any things that boost your immune system are highly recommended.\\n\\nDon't despair.  You're not alone.  Docs and researchers are bound to make a breakthrough.  (Soon, I hope!!!)\\n\\nHere's a couple of websites:\\n\\nhttp://skintherapyletter.com/\\n\\nhttp://www.skincareguide.com/\\n\\nI'll add more links when I get a chance.  I believe I have more url's saved in another directory I can't go to right this second.\\n\\nGood luck.  I'll be checking back for tips myself.\\n\\nP.S.  The Rx I'm using now is Eucerin cream with triamcinolone added (a corticosteroid).\n\nAnswer:",

My (other) friends and family thought this was rude, was it?\nAnswer: Mindbogglingly rude.  I hope you sent your regrets:  \"Congratulations on the beginning of your new life with your husband.  I regret that I cannot attend, as I will be spending time with mine.\"\\n\\nI disagree with the suggestion to send an RSVP saying you'll both come.  If he wasn't invited, he wasn't invited.

So, 500,000 is on the low side. if your a girl, levels decrease before your period and oral contraceptives may cause increased levels. there are many over the counter drugs such as tylenol or zantac that cause decreased level as well. in short 500,000 is normal.\n\nAnswer:",

My father in law has cancer and I need to know . . .?\nQuestion: He was diagnosed with Lymphoma last Wednesday.  The doctor said to come at 4:45 today.  He told my F-I-L that he would most likely be there in consultation until at least 7 pm, and to bring his wife and ONE NON-FAMILY MEMBER.  We are all wondering, what does it mean to be asked to bring ONE NON-FAMILY MEMBER. Is this standard for a new cancer patient discovering his diagnosis, or does this probably intimate some very bad news is coming our way?\\n\\nPlease give me any insight you may have!\nAnswer: The first thing that you need to do is calm down.  I work in cancer research and at one of the best cancer treatment hospitals in the country.  This is a very standard procedure for someone who is newly diagnosed.  Your FIL and the family are going to need a lot of support and a lot of help throughout this entire time.\\n\\nThe doctors understand that your family will be over-emotional during this time and a NON family member will be able to take in information as well as convey information better after the consultation is over.  You should be prepared for A LOT of information to be thrown at you very quickly.  The outside person is simply there to help with the stress of the situation as much as possible.\\n\\nPlease feel free to email me if you need to talk to an outside source I would be really happy to help you and your family riklynn10@hotmail.com\n\nAnswer:",

I really need help on not screwing this up?\nQuestion: I stopped working about a year ago. I told my boss that I was unhappy and I wanted to tell her that I was in the process of looking for another job. I told her that I intended to use my lunch breaks and half-days to go on interviews and I did not anticipate leaving for about 6 months.I never resigned. I did this because I needed the money until I found another job, and so she would not be stranded by me giving her only 2 weeks.\\n\\nLess than a month later I came into work, went into my office and all of my stuff was boxed up and there was someone at my desk on my computer- deleting and copying files. Everyone was shocked to see me there. I logged onto another computer and received and email which stated it was officially my last day with the company. \\n\\nI made an unemployment claim and was given compensation for the 6 months I intended to stay there.\\n\\nWhat do I say at the interview? Was I fired, laid off, or did I quit? Is this too much drama for a prospective employer?\nAnswer: Well to start off, congratulations for being totally upfront and honest with your former employer about leaving the company.  Even though it seems you were punished for this, it was totally the right thing to do; you have nothing to be ashamed of or anything to feel that you should hide, which you would have had if you had been sneaky or deceitful.  So, that is something a new employer should definitely take into consideration.\\nIf I were in your spot, I would be up front and honest about the situation without tearing apart the former boss or company.  I quit my job back inJanuary due to physical and emotional stress, and am just now trying to find a job.  It's taken me that long to get over the damage done to my heart.  I have asked prospective employers to not speak with my former employer, and I tell them the truth:  that it was a very hostile environment and that I am not comfortable with anyone at that company knowing what is going on in my life.  I have, however, given references of people who worked there when I did that are no longer there that I am okay with.  The two places I have been interviewed this week were very understanding.  Mostly, they appreciated my honesty.  But, I was also careful to not tear apart anybody, either.  I think that helped.\\nIf you let them know your version of what happened while being respectful of the people involved and they call your old boss who lets her mouth run off about what a louse you are and drags your reputation through the mud and they choose to listen to her, it's probably not the place for you to be anyway.  Chances are they will compare your respectfulness to her disrespect and you'll win out anyway.  In any case, you'll be able to look at yourself in the mirror the next day, knowing you have done the right thing, no matter the outcome. \\nBest wishes!\n\nAnswer:",

First, he didn't want me to go to church. I was a stay at home mom who couldn't drive and didn't go no where. Pastors wife would pick me up, and take me to church on Sunday morning. Hubby complained he worked all the time and didn't get to spend enough time with me and the kid. Later I started going to Bible study on Wednesday night, and he REALLY didn't like that. Now sometimes, there are social events like dinners, and communions, and he says I \"don't need to\" go to more than one church service a week. I don't get it. I mean its church, for petes sake. Why is he like this? He was brought up Catholic and had to go to church all the time when he was little. I developed my relationship with God when I was 20 and have been involved with a church. But my hubby feels threatened or something if I go more than once a week?\nAnswer: Well you could tell him if he really wanted to spend time with you he could go with you to church.

But that could be because I used to be a weightlifter.  I already had the muscle there, it just went flat.  So when I did it, I immediately noticed results.  Also with pilates, you really have to concentrate and pull the muscles in, in order for it to work.  If you don't feel tension in your core when you are doing pilates, then you're probably not doing them right.  It's hard to do them from a video if you are an exercise beginner.  Also, pilates is for toning muscle, it really won't help with weight loss like walking or jogging, simply because it's not raising your heartrate enough to burn the fat.\n\nAnswer:",

We must all learn to operate with a more sophisticated understanding of the American use of the term \"democracy\" in the first instance.  It doesn't mean (and has never meant) that everyone has an equal say in how things get done.  If that were true, we would all have equal access to our elected representatives.  We do not.  Look at the impact of lobbyists, special interests groups, political action committees, and cronyism on our governmental processes.  It's naive to think that we all have a say.  Still, it is important, as individuals, to remain involved in the process and to let our public officials know how THEY can best serve OUR needs.

Pl quote the verse .\nAnswer: Well its symbolic and it is for the unity of Muslims so that they don't get confused  in praying and should be praying to one point. secondly Mecca is in the mid point of the  world  so  easy for anyone to face that  and pray. Well the prayers are answered even if one go somewhere and could'nt find out the right direction and had  prayed  in some wrong direction . In the beginning there was some confusion about which direction one should pray , so to make it easy Allah has ordered to pray towards Macca.its just for the ease of muslims. Yes its ordered in Quran.\\nQuran 2:144\\n\"Indeed We see the turning of your face to heaven, so We shall surely turn you to a qiblah which you shall like; turn then your face towards the Sacred Mosque, and wherever you are, turn your face towards it, and those who have been given the Book most surely know that it is the truth from their Lord; and Allah is not at all heedless of what they do\n\nAnswer:",

This may be for some or all classes.\\n\\nStudents who are mainstreamed are most often students with mild to moderate learning or emotional disabilities.  They will have an invoiivualized education plan (IEP) written by a team of people concerned about his/her educational progress.  That team generally incudes special education teacher, regular education teachers, specialists such as speech therapists, parents and representatives from any community service providing agencies.\\n\\nThe IEP will include modifications and accomodations that may be made within the general education setting to allow the student to thrive.  These may be as simple as untimed tests and seating near the teacher, to having the teacher wear a special sound ampligfication device, among others.\\n\\nDoes inclusion work?  Well, that depends on the school district's commitment to inclduing kids in the regular classroom, on the students (and parents') willingness to meet some general classroom expectations, and upon the skill of the classroom teacher.  If everyone works together and expects success, it generally happens.  If any member of the instructional team doubts the child's ability to succedd, it usually becomes a self-fulfilling prohecy, and the child may end up back in a separate special education setting. This special environment is viewed as being a more restictive environment, whereas the incluusion class is viewed as a less restrictive environment, as required by the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA).\\n\\nMy third grader has surprised some naysayers and has been included in regular education for math and special subjects for two years now.  I also enjoy helping students reach their academic goals.\\n\\nI hope this answers your question.\n\nAnswer:",

After taking plan b i got an irregular period 6 days later. Does that mean the pill worked?\nAnswer: One possible side effect of taking Plan B is that your next period may be altered, it may be early, late, lighter, heavy or it could be the same. Plan B contains hormones which can cause these changes to your next period as well as some spotting/break through bleeding. Any bleeding or changes to your next period after taking Plan B have NO relationship to whether or not the Plan B was effective in preventing pregnancy.\n\nAnswer:",

McAfee wants to charge me for a third package assigned with a different, third, email address.  Is there good antivirus software that can be purchased once for use on multiple computers, or is there some other solution?  Second question:  What is the best/easiest way to 'clean' a pc of all visited web sites, downloaded files, etc?  Is deleting cookies and temps good enough?\nAnswer: Well, I'm sorry to hear that you paid for McAfee because you should have just used AVG Free.  Now, if this is a home environment (or non-profit organization) then you could just put AVG Free, http://free.grisoift.com/ on the laptop and you won't have to buy anything.  However, if this is some type of business (home or otherwise) then you will need to purchase one of the other AVG versions (if not then you can use the Free version).\\n\\nThe best way to clean your computer is to use CCleaner, http://www.ccleaner.com/ which will remove junk files and clean out the cookies and temporary internet files.  It does a better job than the Windows disk cleaner.  It also has a scanner to remove old registry entries as well (a must if you have installed/uninstalled a lot of programs).\n\nAnswer:",

She knows I have the biggest crush on her.....\nAnswer: Wrong?  That's for you to decide, but here's some food for thought.\\n\\nShe needs your friendship.  If you give her friendship without going for anything more right now, it shows her respect.  Then, when she is less vulnerable, if the two of you get together she will respect you more and you will be able to trust that she's with you for the right reasons and not simply out of need.\\n\\nIf the two of you got involved right now, it might be for the wrong reasons at the wrong time and thus set you up for failure down the road.\\n\\nIf you are \"right\" together, then it won't hurt for you to be her best friend and hold off on the other stuff for a while out of respect for her temporary vulnerability and genuine love or care for her.\\n\\nJust something to consider.

Can my landlord keep my deposit?\nQuestion: I moved into a 4 bedroom property in Hertfordshire, England under a 10 month contract. The contract was for one room, not the house. I had to leave the property after 3 months. However, I made a verbal agreement with my landlord that I could leave as long as I found someone to occupy the room and pay rent for the remainder of the contract. I did this and she signed a new contract AND paid another deposit. That was 5 months ago. Now he is having problems with the new tenant and says he will keep hers and my deposit if he doesn't get all the rent from her. I know this is unfair and I plan to take him to small claims court. BUT i'm worried in court he will say I ended the contract that I signed early. I think he will deny our verbal agreement. I paid all my 3 months rent. If he does do this, can i still get my deposit? I plan on writting him a letter threating court action.\nAnswer: I am not a solicitor, but my darling wife always says, \"A verbal contract isn't worth the paper it's printed on.\"\n\nAnswer:",

(read more)?\nQuestion: Please read this carefully...\\n\\nDoes it rise to the level of a scientific theory?\\nOr even a hopothesis?\\nWhy or why not?\\n\\nThis link may help:\\nhttp://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AtPspx5CqzU_htGM1fYTrRLsy6IX?qid=1006040717662\nAnswer: No, it really isn't.\\n\\nThe fundamentals of intelligent design are basically anti-science.  The sole argument used in its support is to cease thinking about any subject which is not immediately understood.\\n\\n\"That feature of life looks hard to evolve, therefore, Unnamed Intelligent Designer did it.\"\\n\\nI like to look at how history would be different if the great scientists of the past had used such logic.\\n\\nIsaac Newton:  \"Gravity pulls things down, but the moon stays up.  How strange.  Must be God.\"  (Nobody works out the laws of physical motion.)\\n\\nEdward Jenner:  \"I wonder why milkmaids get smallpox less seriously than other people... Oh, I guess God did it.\"  (Nobody invents vaccines.)\\n\\nIntelligent Design \"theory\" is the death of science.  It is lazy thinking.  It is simply accepting any unknown as an unknown and finding nothing in it worth investigating further.  It is the most fundamentally anti-science idea possible.\\n\\nThink my examples of overstated?  Consider the real life guru of the ID movement, Michael Behe.  He testified in court that nobody could figure out the evolution of the immune system.  When he was presented with dozens and dozens of articles working out the evolution of the immune system, he admitted having read none of them, but had no compunction about just declaring it \"wasn't enough\".  How much would be?  Here is a person who has stopped thinking.  He's supposed be a biochemist, but he has no interest in expanding biochemistry.  He found a gap and declared that God filled it and his thoughts stopped there.  Many, many other scientists, unencumbered by the albatross of ID continued to investigate and have expanded our knowledge of the immune system extensively, just so Behe can sit back smugly and declare whatever progress they've made cannot possibly be enough.\\n\\nI repeat, ID is the death of science.  ID is the most fundamentally anti-science idea possible.\\n\\nID \"theory\" is best stated, \"It is absolutely undeniable that someone, somewhere, at some point, did some thing, using some methods, to create life.\"  That's not a theory.  That hardly qualifies as an idea!  But they can't fill in any of the vapidity.  If they fill in any of the unknowns, it becomes obvious they're trying to force their religion onto the masses.  Therefore, they're stuck with a vague framework of an idea.\\n\\nIf they could fill in bits, they might stumble into a theory that was testable.  If we replace \"someone\" with \"My great grandmother\", suddenly, we have an idea we can test.  A false idea, but still a testable one.  My great grandmother has identifiable properties.  We know how much biochemistry she knew.  We can judge the likelihood of her having done such a thing.  That likelihood is, of course, so close to zero there's little point in calculating it.\\n\\nIf we fill in the \"how\" gap with \"using a screwdriver\", then again, we can test it.\\n\\nBut ID theory refuses to fill in the gaps.  It claims to not be interested in who.  It claims to not be interested in where, when, how or what.  Dembski says it's a theory of \"design detection\".  But, again, how do we test it?\\n\\nDembski's filter resolves to two states:  Yes, it was designed!  We don't know.\\n\\nSo, can this be falsified?  Can we send something designed through and have the filter produce a false negative?  No, because the filter has no negative state.  It doesn't say \"designed/not designed\", it says \"designed/don't know\".  There is no way to test for a false negative.\\n\\nCan we test for a false positive?  Nope.  Since God is on the table here (and they refuse utterly to let natural laws have sway like real science does), everything in the universe supposedly could be designed.  So there is nothing that you can definitively say isn't designed to run through the filter.\n\nAnswer:",

There is not a dominant and a recessive gene. Furthermore in incomplete dominance, when both dominant alleles are present in the chromosomes, neither will show up; instead you get a blend of both characteristics. For example in the four o'clock flower, the petal colors white and red exhibit the condition of incomplete dominance. When both white and red alleles are prseent, the result is a pink flower; pink of course being a blend between red and white.\n\nAnswer:",

Lucifer was not happy with the gifts that God had given him; he wanted the gifts that God didn't give him, that were rightfully God's.\\n\\nNo, Satan does not want to see people happy. He will offer and provide people with things that they think they want, but these \"gifts\" will prove themselves to be illusory, in that ultimately they don't bring happiness but instead create within the person the need for more, or something different.\\n\\nAs far as Satan's loneliness goes...anyone is lonely when they willingly cut themselves off from God. The best they can manage is to distract themselves from their loneliness, and one way they distract themselves is by seeking to hoard lots of stuff that isn't God's. Satan seeks to hoard human souls, so as those souls no longer belong to God. So, whatever loneliness Satan may have, it is best that you not go around getting caught up in compassion for his plight, because the fact is that he hates you and will exploit any potential weakness to lure you away from God. That is, if you have compassion for Satan, he will not be moved. He will just see that as an opportunity to attempt to murder your soul.\n\nAnswer:",

One is cystic acne, HOWEVER, if you have not had cystic acne before it would be very unusual for it to start now and for you to have only one spot effected! (fyi, cystic acne is aka underground pimples and do not come to a \"head\" easily and often leave scars).  Two, this could be an ingrown hair. This is much more common in males who shave but can occur in females as well. The hair literally has been covered with epidermis (top layer of skin) and is growing inward which causes a local inflammatory reaction/infection.  Third, an abscess caused by a local infection.  Now, to be technically correct all of the above, including a basic pimple, are abscesses (pus filled lesions). I am differentiating by cause be it a cystic pimple, ingrown hair or secondary infection (i.e. a scratch).\\n\\nTreatment: \"Let the 'evil' humours out!\" \\nIn other words...\"release the pus!\"  Most teenagers are adept at this by squeezing their 'zits,' but the type of lesion/lump you have will not simply erupt with squeezing. If anything, you risk making it worse! So what do you do? Well, you can try: \\n1) Direct heat with a wash cloth soaked in the hottest water you can stand without burning yourself and an astringent such as Witch Hazel.  This will, hopefully, bring the lesion to a 'head' (a whitish or thin dome on top) at which point it is ready for extruding (i.e. a good squeeze to release the pus)!) 2) Apply antibiotic cream or ointment 3 times a day along with a secondary antibiotic like Oxy 10 (this will hopefully reduce the size by fighting the infection). 3) Finally, IF the lump is indeed pus filled and not simple induration (inflammatory response that precedes the pus stage) you need it drained. IF you are lucky and step number one allowed you to get rid of the pus (that white/yellow nasty stuff that you get out of pimples) then, Great! BUT, if you have an ingrown hair or the secondary infection then you will need 'surgical' drainage and treatment of the underlying problem. In other words, a doctor needs to lance the lump with a scalpel. DON'T STRESS! This is done with a bit of local anesthetic and a quick stab with a small surgical blade which releases the pus and you instantly feel much better! You may need oral antibiotics such as cephalexin or sulfa or clindamycin or doxicycline as well as topical (skin applied) antibiotics to treat the infection. The doctor may remove the ingrown hair if that is the cause.\\n\\nBottom line: IF the lump does NOT come to a head or does not recede with topical treatment then you need to see your doctor for definitive care. Don't stress! The treatment is FAR better than the alternative of a worsened infection that could, RARELY, lead to admission to the hospital for major IV antibiotics and surgery.  Treat it early and aggressively!\\n\\nALSO, Since I know that people with pimples may be reading this...PLEASE be careful in squeezing pimples in the 'T' zone. This is the area from the tip of your nose to the forehead from between your eyebrows! The drainage system of this area leads DIRECTLY toward your brain!  I am not joking in relating the following anecdote: I had a patient DIE of a pimple! He squeezed one in this T zone and the infection spread to his brain and he died of cerebritis (brain infection) despite aggressive treatment!\\n\\nUSE topical antibiotics or see your doctor if you have a 'zit' that gets bigger in this 'T' Zone or has worsened redness of the surrounding skin (aka Cellulitis).\\n\\nGood Luck!\\n\\nGreg M.D.\n\nAnswer:",

I think they are a side with real heart and terrific team spirit.  If the tournament were being played at altitude I would give them a chance to advance.\\n\\nHowever, the problem for them is that all games are at sea level.  Ecuador has a terrific record at Estadio Atahualpa in Quito, but their record at sea level is not particularly impressive.  I think in their qualifying campaign they only won one away match (and that was in LaPaz, Bolivia -altitude 10,000 ft).  They couldn't even beat Venezuela away from home.\\n\\nThe Germans are at home, so you have to favour them.  Beating a team from next door (Poland) at sea level will be very tough.  I'd give them a chance against Costa Rica, but that won't be sufficient to see them through to the knockout phase.\\n\\nHowever, I think Antonio Valencia and Franklin Sales will emerge as quality players during the tournament.\n\nAnswer:",

My boyfriend lived in Wisconsin and so I was planning on moving to Milwaukee with him and eventually going to school there. We'll both be moving into the city without jobs right away but should have one within a month.\\n\\nI currently have bills that total to about 400 dollars a month.\\n\\nAs far as moving expenses, there will be none other than gas as I will be having family help me move everything.\\n\\nWhat do you think would be an appropriate amount of money to be saved considering the circumstances?\nAnswer: You will need at least first, last months rent and maybe enough for a security deposit. That could be anywhere from 1400 to 2100 dollars. Turning on your utilities usually has a charge as well so save about a 100 for that. I would also suggest saving the 400 that you will need to your already existing bills plus another 200 for food and miscellaneous items. I am assuming that your boyfriend will split the apartment costs with you evenly so you need $1,100 each for the apartment and an additional $600 on your part for your food and outstanding bills. I would aim for about $2000 in case it takes longer to find a job or at least so you can guarantee paying your second month of rent if you had just gotten a job when rent was due.

Keep in mind - that from the exercise you're toning up and developing muscle. Muscle weighs more than fat but is compact. So you may actually gain weight but trim down if that makes any sense.

If it is correct that Monarch butterflies' survival has been enhanced by this selective adaptation (by their larvae being able to tolerate the toxins in milkweed), and this gave them a competitive advantage in the natural world, then why aren't milkweeds crawling with all sorts of other species of caterpillars gaining similar protection?  In other words, why did only Monarch caterpillars hit on this means of protection from predation, when other butterflies and their larvae could have also adapted to milkweed?  If the Monarch butterly gained this tolerance to milkweed through a chance mutation, then why did chance favour *only* the Monarch butterfly and not other butterflies..?\nAnswer: It's not that they're poisonous but they taste very bitter because they sequester certain chemicals from milkweed. Once a young bird eats one monarch, it never eats another. And actually not all monarchs taste that bitter - but enough to eventually convince most birds to look elsewhere. \\n\\nThe ability of insects to detoxify or sequester plant chemicals is not a random mutation or even a fixed thing. The plant made the chemicals to deter insect feeding (that is, plants with bitter tasting foliage survived when others did not, so now most of the plant population is bitter). Insects then evolved methods to detoxify these chemicals (that is, the caterpillars that could stomach the taste survived and the genes that allowed this behavior multiplied in the population). The process is known as coevolution and takes millennia. Insects are quite often specific to just one type of plant - they grow up together (evolutionarily speaking) and are constantly changing but at a rate we humans can not readily see.\n\nAnswer:",

Is it ok, when, after submitting your resume to a job advertisement--when the prospective employer calls you to chat more with you and possibly set up an interview, to find out if the job encompasses receptionist duties (something I am NOT looking for outside of lunch/vacation/sick coverage)?  Is it tacky to ask, \"Does this position include receptionist duties?\".  The prospective is asking you questions, shouldn't you as well? Or do you wait for the interview to find out...?\nAnswer: Perfectly logical for you to ask questions about the job duties.  It is also a good idea to ask for a copy of your Job Description.  Now they might not allow you to have the job description at the interview stage, but once you are offered the position, you have every right to ask them to provide you with this.  I've interviewed people for the past 15 years and I'm actually concerned when people don't ask questions.  Better to find out prior to your first day what is expected of you.  You can ask directly \"Does this position include receptionist duties?\" or \"What is a typical day like for the position?\"  \\n\\nI like to tell people to not think of it as you are interviewing for the company, but you are the one doing the interview OF the company.  You have knowledge, skills and abilities that they are looking to purchase from you in the form of a salary - but if you are not happy with their working environment, you'll take those knowledge, skills and abilities to the company down the street. \\n\\nGood Luck!!\n\nAnswer:",

At any given time, my parents can both \"act white\" or both \"act black.\" They both love casseroles and collard greens. \\nMy point in all of this is that PEOPLE love American Idol, and PEOPLE dislike American Idol.

For us, it is the time spent together laughing over old times, remembering those that have passed, watching our children marvel over all the traditions, being able to share in some terrific feasts and creating new memories to cherish. I am fortunate that my family genuinely gets along with one another, so the holidays are a time for us to really spend some great quality time together.\n\nAnswer:",

Blacks, from every phase of life in the United States, have been practising this holiday since 1965. This warm, social, holiday where people gather to reinforce each others spirit and friendship was founded by Professor Maulana Karenga.\\nCelebration of this holiday lasts for seven days from December 26 to January 1.\\nIt is a holiday based on the African celebration of the \"first fruits harvest\" which comes at the end of their year, and KWANZAA lasts seven days to promote the seven basic principles honored during this holiday.\\n\\n1. Unity - 2. Self determination - 3. Collective work and responsibility 4. Co-operative economics 5. Purpose 6. Creativity & 7. Faith\\n\\nAt KWANZAA gatherings people usually bring fruit or food and share a meal and a smile. The unity cup is passed and people say positive things about Blacks and our future. Then the candles are lit, and something is said about each principle. After that people dance or talk, and just have a good time. There's a lot more to this holiday than superficial gift giving. It's a time to lift each other up and give thanks for being of a unique culture with a value all its own.\\n\\nThey also have a stamp that was created by Synthia St. James who was born in Los Angeles...

The novel's hero, Gabriel Oak is a farmer, shepherd, and bailiff, marked by his humble and honest ways, his exceptional skill with animals and farming, and an unparalleled loyalty. He is Bathsheba's first suitor, later the bailiff on her farm, and finally her husband at the very end of the novel. Gabriel is characterized by an incredible ability to read the natural world and control it without fighting against it. He occupies the position of quiet observer throughout most of the book, yet he knows just when to step in to save Bathsheba and others from catastrophe.\n\nAnswer:",

Depending on where you live, lenders typically cannot charge more than 60% interest per annum.\\n\\nLaws against \"usury\" go back to biblical times and were adopted by states starting in the 18th century. The concept was simple: People in dire need of money will pay just about any interest rate to get it. So society moved to protect them from sleazy lenders who threaten to break legs.\\n\\nIn New York, for instance, it's a crime for an individual to charge more than 25% interest on a loan. But what's illegal for a loan shark in New York is perfectly legal for credit card issuers that put their operations in states that have no rate ceilings, such as South Dakota and Delaware. They can charge their customers everywhere whatever they wish, because what counts is the law of the state where their credit card operations are based.\n\nAnswer:",

The best theory I could find was that you yawn because you're not getting enough oxygen to the brain (maybe there is a lack of oxygen in the space you're standing).  Whenever you're aware of someone yawning, it activates a reaction in your subconscious mind that acts as a threat response.  Basically, whenever you see someone yawn, it makes you body think there is a shortage of oxygen too, and you yawn in response.  No one knows if this is actually the case, but I think that it is a good theory.\n\nAnswer:",

One thing I like about it (over meeting in person right off the bat) is that there is a little more of a safety margin when you first start chatting on the computer  because you're not actually meeting in person.  My usual approach is to correspond and/or chat online for a little while, maybe talk on teh phone a few times (usually a cell phone) before meeting, and then meeting the person if I feel comfortable with her.  (If I don't feel comfortable with her, there will be no meeting, and might not be anything further than a chat or two online).  The first few dates would probably be in a public place, such as a restaurant.\\n\\nAs with meeting people the old fashioned way, you run the risk of meeting good and bad people, but the internet gives you that initial safety margin to make a better informed decision.\n\nAnswer:",

If so, why not bring it to the US?  If not, what are we bringing?\nAnswer: We do live in a republic.  A democracy (means rule by the people in latin) is when the people vote on each and every issue that comes up.  A 'rep'ublic (based on the same word as 'rep'resentative in latin) is when we elect representatives (president, representative, senator, governor, legislator, and so on) to represent us on each of these issues.\\n\\nNow I do agree with your argument about bringing it to the US.  In the 2004 election only 28% of population voted, as compared to the 70% in Israel, the 78% in Iraq when they first voted.  In fact, with the exception of Britain and France, nearly every democratic country in the world is above 60%.  But the United States, England, and France all show in the low 20's.  Not exactly people ruling, nor even representatives of the population ruling.\n\nAnswer:",

I had originally told my girlfriend I would do a lot of shopping for her while in Europe. As a college student, I don't have much money, but I'm by no means broke. I bought her a nice traditional garnet/gold ring in Prague for her birthday and figured that was better than buying her a nice outfit. I am debating about whether to do a shopping spree for her here and just give her the things when I get back, or saving my money now and just taking her out for a surprise date in which I'd take her out for a really nice date and pay for a manicure/pedicure and possibly the perm she wants, take her to the scrapbook store to buy some new things (she loves that), and possibly buy her a really nice set of hair care products too. Do you think that is all better than trying to buy her some random clothes here? I may still get her some lingerie here, but I could buy her a few outfits but then I'd spend all my money here.\nAnswer: Don't spend \"all\" your money, but do buy her some presents while you are away.  It shows that you were thinking of her all the time you were apart, and if you wait until you get back home, it will look like you are making a lame effort to catch up. Just save a little for something special when you get home.\\n\\nAlso, you should write to her to let her know what you are doing.  (\"I got you a really nice outfit today.  I was going to get two of them, but I want to save some money to get you something else when we are back together.\")\\n\\nGood luck!  I hope she appreciates you.\n\nAnswer:",

Learn as much as you can about the company you are applying to, and if possible, learn about the division/dept. you will be working for.\\n\\n2. Try to intuit what they want to hear. It isn't that you want to tell them what they want to hear - interviewers are smart, and know when they are being played. But by knowing what characteristics they are looking for, you know how to emphasize those spots on your resume that align with that.\\n\\n3. Be prepare to be quizzed on work scenarios, ethical scenarios, hypothetical teamwork challenges. Try and formulate answers in advance to typical hypothetical workday issues that might be raised.\\n\\n4. Don't sit until your interviewer asks you to take a seat.\\n\\n5. Do as much listening as you can. While a good interviewer is there mostly to listen and not to talk, the good interviewee will often do the same. Don't be silent - if asked a question, answer it. But take the opportunities you do have to listen, and pay attention. What you are told will work to your advantage, if you are paying attention - it will make you seem alert if you make clear you have absorbed it.\\n\\n6. Don't fidget or show signs of anxiousness.

Is there any other way eating too much fruit can be harmful to your health? Sometimes I eat more fruit than anything else in the day.\nAnswer: thats good that u eat a lot of fruit . fruits contain sucrose which is a form of glucose . it willnot increase ur weight even if u eat a lot of fruits . as most of fruit contain vitamin c which will be lost with in few hours in the form of sweat and urine . i would like to suggest to eat protein rch items like soyabeans to increase ur weight and increase ur muscles\n\nAnswer:",

Seriously, women love to read into things, but men are pretty straight forward. He was rejecting you. He does not like you more than a friend. You need to deal with that. If you want to know why, you can ask him and he'll tell you probably since guys are straight forward and honest most of the time. \\n\\nI once asked a guy why he rejected me... we were friends and I tried to make it more and he said, \"we're just friends, nothing more\". He told me honestly why he didn't like me more than a friend and I respected that. We are still good friends. It hurt at first, but I appreciated the honesty and it allowed me to move on without sore feelings and feeling like I had to keep trying to make him like me. \\n\\nMove on... it's the best thing for you.\n\nAnswer:",

It depends on quite a few factors. An enlarged pituitary can cause a \"mass effect\" displacing structures from their normal position, such as the optic chiasma, causing vision difficulties. Also the pituitary controls the secretion of a number of hormones, with varying functions. The best thing for you to do is to speak to your physician/neurosurgeon who will be able to better characterize the lesion and give you a more precise answer to your question.\n\nAnswer:",

He's told a select few of us, and that's all.  However, he did tell both of our parents.  How he did this:  He took them out to eat and told them plain and simple.  I'm not sure how your family is, but my family is very accepting, and my parents didn't mind so much.  No offense, but if your family is any good - they already have a clue!  So the answer to your question?  The sooner, the better.  Take your folks out to dinner and ask them how best to tell the rest of your family.

First know that the bureau must verify any debt you dispute.  If they can not verify it, it must be deleted.  They have 30 days to do this.\\n\\nWith 7 years in the credit business, I recommend disputing them all at the same time, as you will likely need to go through several rounds of letters to get what you want done. If something is blatently wrong with your credit report, call the bureau after they write back and refuse to remove it. Go up the food chain until a manager agrees to remove or amend the incorrect info on the spot. Don't buy into their speach about re-disputing it - but make sure you have provided the information necessary by mail already to correct the error. It will not help you to insist on something being removed if you have not provided verificaiton on why.\\n\\nWhen you mail in the dispute letter, mail in as much information as possible with it. If your verification is a bankruptcy, send in all the pages to your petition and tab the important pages for them to review.\\n\\nAlso mail in a copy of an electric bill and a copy of your ID to avoid any delays. See the FTC web's site for your specific rights with collectors and debt reporting:\\n\\nhttp://www.ftc.gov/\\n\\nIf your problem is directly with the creditors, write to them ONE time. If they do not remove incorrect information, write to your state's attorney general's office and the FTC. This will get you the results you seek if you are in the right.\\n\\nIf this is a collection agency problem, write to the same people plus the ACA at www.acainternational.org. Collection agencies are generally slime, so know your rights before you call them. See your rights here:\\n\\nhttp://www.ftc.gov/bcp/conline/edcams/credit/index.html\\n\\nIf you have legit items that are bad, dispute them also. If they can not be verified, they must be deleted. It is not your responsibility to prove they are inaccurate, it is the credit bureaus who must demonstrate they are.\\n\\nHope this helps!\n\nAnswer:",

I also work nights and I feel like it's thowing me out of whack. (Don't say switch to days, I can't right now.) Any suggestions/constructive thoughts?\nAnswer: I worked nights for 3 years and I learned that it was best to just live life that way. Make sure you have a \"normal\" routine just like you would working days. And keep that routine on your days off if at all possible. That is what I eventually had to start doing because it's too hard trying to get your body & mind adjusted to a 1st shift schedule for just a couple days a week. You are probably just not a 3rd shift person and it's really affecting you emotionally. I understand what you're saying about not being able to switch to days right now.

It is the ratio of weight of water to the weight of cement used in the concrete mix. It has some important influences on the quality of concrete produced. Concrete with a low water-cement ratio may become strong and durable, but the mix would become very difficult to place. If water-cement ratio is increased then the concrete mix would be more workable (or loose). It is easier to place the concrete in this condition but too much water can cause pores to form in the microstructure, thereby reducing the durability. The water-cement ratio is a critical factor in the design of concrete mixes.\n\nAnswer:",

We had a substitute teacher and I thought it might be a good idea to ask the teacher for his opinion on the argument.  These were the teacher's exact words, \"God created animals for us to eat.\"  He then went on to say that animals do not have free-will and they have no feelings because it says that in the bible.  I go to a public school and teachers are not allowd to teach creationism.  I'm concerned that he is going to teach this to other kids.  Do you think I should make a big deal out of this or not?\nAnswer: I wouldn't make a fuss about it.Parents influence their kids when it comes to religion.No matter what the teacher says,the child usually believes their parents anyway.I heard one kid say \"I don't believe in Evolution because my mamma told me it was false\".However the child must understand that he doesn't have to  believe the theories,but he must still learn them.\\n\\nJust let it go.He was a substitute.The only time you should report him is if he dimisses facts and evidence that he is suppose to teach.His thoughts of them doesn't matter as long as he teaches his lessons.He only gave his opinion.It's not like he made a quiz based on what he said.\\n \\n\\nedit: \\n \\nAnd I disagree that God made animals as food just for us.Animals eat each other for food and to some animals we are food for them.Every living creature is food for another creature.Humans don't only eat other animals.Other animals were around before we even came along.If  the Specie who was the top of the food chain at the time had our intelligence,they would have thought that God made animals as food just for them also.\\n\\n Evolution is not taught as fact,but as a theory that is supported by evidence.Creationism doesn't have any evidence to support it;that's why it shouldn't be taught in science class.\\n\\nChristians always criticize the evolutionary theory as if the story of creation has better evidence to support it.Life and earth is not evidence.Anyone could have made a story of how life and earth came about after the fact.\\n\\nAnd they should not prohibit the teaching of evolution in school.It is taught as a theory that is supported by scientific evidence.There are many scientific theories.Should they be omitted also? No.It's science.Science isn't always about proving something absolutely true.It is also about finding evidence and coming up with a theory.A theory isn't a theory unless it has evidence to support it.\n\nAnswer:",

Then minimum nonzero separation so that the observer hears little or no sound is given by  \\n            y = {(2n+1)vD}/2fd \\nwhere v = 340 m/s\\n      D = 12 m\\n      d = distance b/w loud speakers\\n      f = 1000 Hz\\n\\nTake n = 0\\n\\n      y = 2.04/d m ( here d is not given)\n\nAnswer:",

You meet a woman with kids - how many kids is too many kids for your girlfriend to have? What do you think?\nAnswer: That depends on what you're comfortable with. I would never date someone who had a kid myself. Also what kind of woman is she? Some women take advantage of guys and try to get them to support children that aren't even theirs. I'm not saying she's like that, but some of them are, especially if they're feeling overwhelmed.

Im worried. what should i do when my son is old enough to realize this. i wonder what is going to think\nAnswer: Hmmm?\\n\\nI don't know that I see the problem.  What's your son going to think when he gets old enough to realize?  He's going to think \"Daddy likes to wear girl's clothes.\", or, if the sex change has already happened by then, then he'll have another mommy, I'm assuming.  Neither one is going to scar the kid, or even really affect him.  If he grows up knowing that there's nothing wrong or weird with his dad doing that, then he won't think anything of it (so long as the outside world doesn't know and tease him about it).  It'll just be one of the things daddy does, like mommy liking to put on her sweatpants to do the laundry or something similar, you know- just a little idiosyncracy.  And so long as he sees/understands that other men don't necessarily do it, he won't go raiding your closet (unless of course he wants to, which, in that case, you can't change it).  He'll grow up fine and healthy- just approach this with reason and rationality and show your son that you love him and your family is normal.\\n\\nGood luck!\n\nAnswer:",

I lost my best friend in Iraq and i want others opinion on the war.?\nAnswer: Former Secretary of State Powell did say 'if we break it, we own it'!  How true those words now are!\\n\\nThe war in Iraq is a direct result of a misguided, misinformed, selfish, and arrogant administration.  Sadly enough in 2004, a slim majority gave this administration four more years to perpetuate and exacerbate this conflict.  \\n\\nThe people in this administration used the 9/11 attacks to implement a pre-conceived agenda.  Virtually the entire world was in our corner following the devious terrorist attacks.  The support was there to bring those responsible to justice.  Yet, this administration squandered that global support at the expense of our credibility as a nation, and more importantly, at the expense of our brave men and women in uniform.  \\n\\nThey used fear as their primary tool to convey their argument for war.  This fear was further extended by lying to us as a nation as well as to the global community, by suggesting that a link existed b/w Al-Qaeda and Saddam Hussein's regime.  Such an assertion was completely false and baseless, yet we were sold anyway.  Without delving too deeply,  the premise for war morphed time after time.  The terrorist link, weapons of mass destruction, Iraqi liberation, democratization of Iraq, etc. were all given as reasons/justification for war.  \\n\\nThe initial lies were uncovered so the premise needed to change.\\nAnd change again!  Yet, the U.S. is not that good at nation building.  It's not our place nor our business.  If it is, why aren't we doing more in the Sudan?  How about North Korea perhaps?.  More importantly, the invasion of Iraq has distracted us from what should be our true objective.  That is, bringing the bastards responsible for 9/11 to justice! \\n\\nThis is an unjust and unnecesary adventure we are on. Furthermore, the invasion was a violation of international law.  Sprinkling freedom dust isn't the answer.  Conducting ourselves  as a responsible/law abiding and just nation, should be the example being set.  Furthemore, we eventually become immune to fear tactics.  When is the last time we had a terror alert by the way?  Before the 2004 election I believe!    Hmmmmm.?\\n\\nYour friend deserved better from our leaders.  We all do!\n\nAnswer:",

A much more effective way to boost worker productivity is to link the work to morale and their self-image.  When workers are proud to work for a company, they will work harder, even without pay increases, because their work is tied in with their self-worth.\\n\\nThe opposite is also true.  If workers do not like their work environment and do not relate it to their self-worth, they will have poor productivity, even if pay increases are given to them.\\n\\nHere is a link to an academic paper on the subject.\n\nAnswer:",

No, I  had not run much before those two days and not stretched before.  I also have been experimenting with orthodics in my shoes ever since hoping that might cure the problem but could it have made it worse? I want to continue to exercise, actually my muscles hurt less when I keep moving, how should I proceed?\nAnswer: Hi! I'm a certified personal trainer with 10 years experience. I am wondering if you'd been running prior to this? Did you just decide to take up running then do 2 days in a row? Running is a high impact sport. It is best alternated with lower-impact activiities. Whether you were running before or not, it is better to run every OTHER day and let your muscles get some recovery time. Muscles don't get stronger with exercise, they get stronger AFTER exercise, during the recovery period. Rest is essential to muscle growth and fitness advancement. Doing light workouts on the days between allows more blood flow to the overworked muscles and speeds up recovery time. Taking 1000 IU's of vitamin E has also been shown to reduce muscle soreness by repairing muscle oxidation on a cellular level. Running 3 days per week is excellent for cardio fitness, but every day of the week ABOVE 3, increased your chance of injury by 100%.  I would recommend talking with a trainer who has a certification from ACE, NASM, ACSM or NSCA. Those are the 4 best certifications out there. There are more than 200 others that are just paper. Let them design you a program. Some trainers will even do some muscle tests on you to find out if you have muscle imbalances or problems. The orthodics might be hurting you, not helping. Please seek professional advice. It could save you some serious injury for a very small price.\n\nAnswer:",

The expression was documented as being in wide usage in the 1920s, but may have originated much earlier.\\n\\n\"Shucking and jiving\" was a tactic of both survival and resistance.  A slave, for instance, could say eagerly, \"Oh, yes, Master,\" and have no real intention to obey.  Or an African-American man could pretend to be working hard at a task he was ordered to do, but might put up this pretense only when under observation.  Both would be instances of \"doin' the old shuck 'n jive.\"\\n\\nToday, the expression has expanded somewhat from earlier usage, and is now sometimes used to mean \"talking pure baloney,\" \"goofing off,\" or \"goofing around.\"  The original meaning of deceit often remains, however.\n\nAnswer:",

Should I worry?\nQuestion: I am 30 and have edema in my legs and feet nearly everyday. I do not have heart problems. I do have sleep apnea and high blood pressure which probably cause the edema.  Should I treat the edema and is it causing damage to my body & what can happen with this over the years?\nAnswer: Idiopathic Edema is a common disorder that occurs almost exclusively in women. It is characterized by salt retention in the absence of heart, kidney, or liver disease. The swelling (edema) may be episodic or persistent. Swelling of the face, hands, and feet develops rapidly, frequently accompanied by headache, irritability, and depression. Weight gain also occurs.\n\nAnswer:",

Just be open with him, tell him you're not ready. Don't be pressured into anything you don't want to do. Although in todays society people act like their virginity is nothing special, it really is.

That should get rid of the swelling and redness. Then you need to treat it with an insecticide. I suggest RAID ant and roach spray.

A kinase is always an enzyme that phosphorylates something, that is, it adds a phosphate group. So creatine kinase is an enzyme that catalyses the phosphorylation of creatine to store phosphate, and the reverse reaction to transfer the phosphate back to ADP to form ATP.\n\nAnswer:",

I was right and you were wrong!!\" So, not only is there $50 on the line here, it's also bragging right s for eternity!! lol\\nSo, can anyone help me? I can't remember the name of the character I'm thinking of, but he was the big guy who was bashing his head against the wall the first time you see him in the movie and at the big game at the end of the film he said to Adam Sandler's character, \"I'm glad you're back, now I don't have to stab you\"\\nSo, am I right? Is that The Great KHALI?\nAnswer: Singh played the role of \"Turley\" in the 2005 remake of the film The Longest Yard. He plays an unstable inmate with an insecure attitude. In addition, the character of Turley is shown to be virtually unstoppable and limitless in strength. He easily grounds the second biggest man, Switowski, played by the 6 ft 6 in and 340 lb Bob Sapp. Turley is built up as an insanely powerful man throughout the film, who manages to run a Touchdown despite three of the opposing team's players on his back.\n\nAnswer:",

They represent different grades of pencil.  I do a lot of pencil sketching and use many grades of pencil depending on the need and effect I'm looking for.\\n\\nIt's been my experience that the softer grades are great for contrast and shading. They're also good for darkening large areas of a drawing.  They do tend to \"cake up\" and smudge easily if too much is applied.\\n\\nThe harder grades are great for fine lines and when exact detailing is required.  They can hold a razor sharp point longer too.

In Nov. 2005 I called again the fine was $715.00 I had the money but I had family problems so I had to use the money elsewhere. I inquired again in Feb. 2006 after I received my income tax and the fine increased to $1350.00 and i was told if it wasn't paid in 30 days the warrant stands and not to call again. I want to resolve this and get my license back but i feel this is unfair. Is there something I can do or can anyone tell me  when the ticket will no longer be valid?

The ones about lowering the freezing point are good, but not quite there. If it just lowered the freezing point (which is true) it would never melt the ice/snow, since it nothing has affected the temperature yet. What happens is that the first interaction of salt and ice/snow (water) causes heat to be released, it is an exothermic reaction. That little bit of heat allows more ice to melt, reacting with more salt, creating more heat, melting more ice, etc. So it is the exothermic reaction that causes the melting, the lower freezing point keeps it from refreezing.\n\nAnswer:",

At the end of a lower mass star's life (for stars up to about 8 times the mass of the sun), the star puffs up, and loses the outer layers of gas surrounding it.  All this gas goes out into space where it can be seen as what we call a planetary nebula.\\n\\nOriginally the word \"nebula\" was applied to any astronomical object that was not a star or a memeber of our solar system (planets, asteroids etc), the word essentially means \"cloud.\"\\n\\nAs telescopes got better people started to find many different types of nebulae. A Spiral Nebula looks like, well a spiral, today we know that these are spiral galaxies.  Planetary Nebula were named because the looked round, and a number of them had the same greenish color that Uranus had been seen to have by Hershel.\n\nAnswer:",

She askes me if I honestly like her - I say Yes. She says we should get to know each other - I say OK. A day later says she just wants to be friends because she doesn't want to get hurt again and mess up our friendship! She constantly keeps asking me if I'm OK with her or angry!\\n\\nWhat does it mean?\nAnswer: It means either she's bipolar or has another mental problem, or she's just extremely indecisive and doesn't know what she wants.  If you really want to be with her romantically, you need to sit down with her and make definitive, clear statements about everything.  That way, she can't just change her mind later.\\n\\nIf you're not interested in a future with her romantically, stay her friend and move on.

Valerian root and melatonin are the two best. melatonin will always be in pill form that i know of, but it's just a replicate of the exact same chemical that your brain uses to put you to sleep. it's either the best stuff out there or it won't work at all. that depends on you. Valerian root on the other hand, has one major benefit for you. it doesn't to be a pill. u can actually buy this in it's natural form and i think u boil it in some water. the pills for valerian root and melatonin are the most convenient.  there may also be some herbal teas that have it.\\n\\n2.)ur second bet is herbal teas. there are alot of them available a sleep aid and even if they don't have Valerian root they do have other things that work. and drinking something warm before u go to bed usually helps you go to sleep anyhow. warm milk can sometimes do it for me. you need to make sure, however, that you do not drink anything with sugar or caffeine in it at least 2 hours before you go to bed. if i have to go to bed at ten, i don't drink caffeine after 5 pm, or not at all if i can help it. also, u might try not smoking about a half hour before sleeping if u r a smoker.\\n\\n3.) another thing u can try is a sleep CD. my friend Whitney swears by some of them. they have music or sounds or just gentle whispering and she says that some of hers will put u to sleep within 5 minutes of starting them.\\n\\n4.) make sure that you have the most comfortable bed set up possible. if your like me, your body and mind love finding any excuse to get up, and the wrong pillow blanket and mattress is an easy target. i love the foam pillows but the foam mattresses suck for me. but it all depends on you. if you sleep in clothes, make sure they are soft and loose. it's better to sleep in the nude, however. also keeping a room a bit too cold for ur tastes but having plenty of cover is a great way to go to sleep. you'll wrap urself up tightly and u won;t move. soon you'll be asleep. i always sleep better in winter.\\n\\n5.) reading or watching a television show that just DOES NOT INTEREST YOU is another way. i watch the news because i hate the news. sometimes the news can conk me out in the middle of the day. \\n\\n6.)there are plenty of meditation exercises out there and lots of them can relax you to the point of sleepiness. instructions for quite a few should be available on line, but try this one: breath in and fill your lungs all the way up. imagine that when you breathe in you are breathing in a number (the number one for the first breath and so on). fill ur lungs up completely with ones. then breath out all of the ones (emptying ur lungs completely) and then continue with the number two. sounds crazy but it does relax you and if ur laying on ur back in ur bed, it can actually put you to sleep.\\n\\ni hope one of these works!!\n\nAnswer:",

Carlos Lee does have more HR and RBI though.  But Lee is too hot now (on the pace of 70 HR and 140 RBI), you have to expect him to cool off.\\n\\nThe problem for this trade is Joe Nathan, he is too good to be traded.  He is one of the top 5 closers in the league, and best among your closers.  Since Chad Tracy has closing stats as Carlos Lee, it doesn't make sense to give out Nathan at the same trade.\n\nAnswer:",

I don't know where to find him.\nAnswer: Please don't be misled by the previous responder. You are correct in asking your question. Most likely, unless you have been served by court documents you are probably still married. There is an off chance that your husband found an attorney that circumvented the service of process laws and your husband could still have been granted a divorce where ever he is without you knowing. There is no easy way to find out, but a good divorce attorney or PI may be able to, especially if a divorce has been granted somewhere. If you want to be divorced, your best bet is to initiate divorce proceedings yourself. Your attorney can serve your husband by publication if he cannot be located and you will be granted a divorce.\n\nAnswer:",

I need Bariatric Rou en Y.  It is a $24,000 surgery that is not covered by my insurance.  My credit is good but I do not have a home to mortgage or finance.  Does anyone know of a government financial assistance program or anything that may help a middle classer with surgery?\nAnswer: Everyone else gave you basically the same advice I would.\\nYour surgeon's office should be able to help you with getting insurance approval. If they can't/won't, think about switching surgeons.  Or insurance companies. \\nMy husband's companies insurance guy had originally said there was a \"rider\" which his boss would have to purchase for the whole company that would cover the surgery. We were willing to pay for that rider if it was just a few thousand dollars, and then the offer was withdrawn (probably because they didn't think we'd actually volunteer to pay!).  So find about that option. Even if it's $5,000, that's $19,000 less than the surgery. Look into supplemental insurance that you buy on your own that might pick up some of the costs.\\nAs a last-ditch attempt, you can ask for donations from friends and co-workers.   If you work for a big company, try to get them to donate some money to you by saying how much healthier you will be after your weight loss.  Have a party to raise money--I've done it for other people (not for surgery)--have poker tournaments where the winner gets half the pot and you get the other half.  Find massage therapists and palm readers who will donate half or all their proceeds for treatments during the party.  Combine it with a Body Shop or Tupperware party and ask everyone to round up their payment and give it to you, and have the consultant donate part of the profits to your cause (you must have a friend who sells SOMETHING like this).\\nYou'd be surprised how your friends and loved ones will rally around you if you show that you are determined to raise this money.\n\nAnswer:",

You will have to return to the States one way or another. You have proof that you weren't even in the states when your Mom stole your ID. I knew a young girl here in Illinois who was told she could get her credit cleared but she had to press charges against her Mom she really didn't want to but she just had no other choice.

I don't think he is to blame for New Orleans (like some people out there do).  I'm glad that Saddam Hussein is out of power, but, sometimes I wonder if the cost of bringing him to justice is too high.  \\n\\np.s.  I hate it when people just use entirely emotion-based arguments when discussing politics, like when people say, \"I hate Bush!  He's so stupid!  etc. etc. etc.\"  There is a way to discuss ideas about politics and government without losing your cool.  This is also why I hate CNN and FoxNews and all of those other sensationalistic news channels.\n\nAnswer:",

For a 3- or 4-year-old toddler, a pillowcase becomes a superhero cape and the cardboard core of a roll of paper towels is used as a trumpet.\\nBy age 4 or 5, a child's ideas and experiences with family and the social world provide material for games like 'house' or 'driving the car.' While some play is solitary or shared with adults, most symbolic play takes place with school peers or neighborhood buddies. Kids this age also adore construction play, building (with toys like Lego or blocks), and rough and tumble play (like ring-around-the-rosy).\n\nAnswer:",

Do you need to get as much as you give or vice versa?\nAnswer: I have a question for you . . . what is the purpose for this friendship . . . for the two of you to become lover or just friends.\\n\\nLet me tell you something . . . when you are friends with a woman . . . that is all you are going to be . . . very rarely less than 10% move on to the next level . . . no matter how bad you want to advance.\\n\\nAs to your questions : basis of friendship . . . common interests . . . communication . . . interaction.\\n\\nAs for your second question . ..  Do you need to get as much as you give or visa versa? (This is why I asked the previous questions in the beginning).  There is no give or take in a friendship . . . you do things because they are your friends not for a payback.  Same thing for relationship . . . women claim they want a 50/50 relationship when in fact it is more like 85/15 in their favor.  Women like to be wined and dined and guys like burgers and a beer.  Guys don't care about the new fancy resturant that opened up at $150 per plate . . . we are happy spending $9.00 at Fudrukkers (I know it is mispelled okay).  But you get the point.  What do we get out of the dinner with the girl . . . maybe sex . . . but not necessarily . . . odds are you are just her meal ticket.\\n\\nWhen you take guys out . . . your buddies . . . you buy a round they buy a round . . . you buy dinner one time and they will the next.  I took a buddy to a hockey games . . . and he bought me drinks and snacks during the game.  Will girls do that . . . the majority will not. . . and that is a fact.\\n\\nGiving and getting will never be equal . . . but with male buddies . . . they will share . . . as for women . . . you better have a big wallet. (Not all women are like this . . . but the majority are)\\n\\nListen to a man who lived through it . . . and if not me . . .

You could try to think of it differently. For instance, the reason your parents don't pay as much attention could be that they trust you enough to look after yourself.\n\nAnswer:",

For example: New shoes $120 12 months = $10 a month.\\n\\nYou will have in your budget items that are considered 'fixed' items - like rent/mortgage, utilities, gas/transportation, etc.\\n\\nLine your fixed items up, then your goals under that, next to all of them will be your monthly figure. Once you have a total, you subtract that from your net(in pocket) pay.\\n\\nYou will either have money left over OR you will not have enough - this is when you need to rework your budget - for example: New shoes $120 2 years (24 months) = $5 and so on.\\n\\nI have used new shoes, but of course it can be anything that is important to YOU.\\n\\nPlease consider, as part of your budget, money for emergencies. Six to twelve months of FIXED living expenses (or somewhere in between ) is a good number. This (emergency fund) may take you a while, but it will be well worth it when you have an emergency.\\n\\nIf you have a preadsheet program, Xcel or any other, this will make the calculations easier - as it will recalculate as you change items.\\n\\nGood luck!\n\nAnswer:",

Now personally, I'm sure we're not as complicated as what I thinks most likely is out in space, but I find it hard to reason how we developed from a single cell life form.  Anyone have a chart of life's path from that to us...which would make some sense out of this?\\n\\nI'm not saying there is or isnt' a god or that someone planted us here, but the conventional explanation of evolution is just not clear in my head.  Could someone demonstrate a timeline that makes sense of earth's inhabitance from it's creation?\nAnswer: Your question is a very reasonable one --and brave, since you'll certainly get answers from religious zealots who have completely closed their minds.  Let me start by saying my *only* personal agenda is a search for the truth, no matter where it leads me.  Unlike many, I'm not here to shove my beliefs down anyone's throat. \\n\\nThe short answer is that I doubt it's possible in this kind of forum to get into enough details to convince a confirmed *creationist* that humans evolved from simpler life forms.  But I hope to encourage an open-minded person to continue with their own research, and not be tempted by overly \"easy\" answers.   \\n\\nThe long answer (most of it written by me, some of it transcribed manually; none of it pasted)...\\n\\nI, too, was unclear about the evolutionary process for a long time.  While I'm not an expert (and *nobody* has *all* the answers) I think I can help you get to a place where it makes *sense* to you as it now does to me, since you appear to have an open mind.  (Agnosticism is good!)  \\n\\nAfter hearing people's arguments and questions for many years, I am convinced that there are six huge factors getting in the way of a general acceptance of the *overwhelming* scientific evidence for evolution.  \\n\\n1 - the common misconception that evolution claims apes or chimpanzees changed to human beings, and the perceived indignity -- and indignation -- that goes along with that idea... or with *any* suggestion that we evolved from a lower form.  It's nothing but ridiculous human arrogance!\\n2 - the lack of human conception for the vast time life has had on Earth to evolve\\n3 - the human temptation to rush things and jump to ridiculous (and therefore naturally hard to believe) conclusions.  Evolution involves not three or four steps, like fish to amphibian to ape to human!)... not hundreds, or even thousands of big, visible steps... but perhaps hundreds of millions of minute, subtle changes in a life form.  Remember, we have had the time!\\n4 - the mistaken notion that creatures evolved because they \"decided\" to, or \"wanted\" to.  When we say, for example, that fish needed to absorb oxygen more efficiently from the water, so they evolved gills, that's not to imply it was a choice.  Evolution is about mutations... changes that were random from one generation to the next, over long periods of time.  Those changes that happened to be good for the creature meant that creature survived long enough to reproduce, which meant there would now be lots of little babies with that same feature.\\n5 - a fearful and/or stubborn refusal to abandon faith in a Creator, since doing so might condemn the unbeliever to eternal suffering\\n6 - It's just *easier* to think about a Creator.\\n\\nI know you want to see some details of our \"life's path\" to make sense of it, and I will provide that, below.  Just a bit more, first.\\n\\nThe central ideas of evolution are that all life shares a common ancestor, and that it has changed over time (obviously, if we are to explain getting from A to B).  While it's hard for many people to imagine the changes that would result in, for example, human beings from lifelessness, the first thing to keep firmly in mind is that we are talking about an *unimagineable* amount of time to play with... the earth having been around for some 4.5 billion years, as you said.\\n\\nUnderstandably, few people can appreciate how much a billion is.  Do you realize that roughly a billion *seconds* ago, \"The Godfather, Part 2\" was about to win the Academy Award for Best Picture?... that Richard Nixon was President of the U.S.?... that Hank Aaron had just broken Babe Ruth's record of 714 career home runs?  1974 was drawing to a close -- one billion seconds ago.\\n\\nIt's a lack of appreciation for this vast amount of time which, I think, makes people skeptical.  They wonder how, in any amount of time they can envision, an ape can c\n\nAnswer:",

If you have ever?\nQuestion: made a change to your diet and fitness, please help!!!!\\n\\nI've tried contacting a dietitian on Craigs List, but he kept promoting some box drinks...I want to learn HOW to eat properly, not be fed something that supposedly IS healthy.\\n\\nFOr instance, what is a healthy breakfast?\\nHow do you stave off hunger?\\n\\nIs it best to withdraw from food at the beginning (like a fast) to prepare your system?\\n\\nPls advise....\nAnswer: A healthy diet consists of a variety of food groups....let me be specific. Lets say you are a female (which I think you are) with a moderate activity level, for example: exercise 3 times a week for 45 min. or 5 times a week for 20 mins. This includes stretching 4 times a week and some sort of strength training (this could be as simple as carrying groceries for a few blocks or actually weight lifting) once or twicw weekly. It is recommended (Canada's food guide) that you eat 1900-2200 calories per day. ;Broken down even further, the food guide suggests:\\n7 fruits/vegetables\\n7 grains\\n3 dairy products\\n2 meat/alternatives\\n6 fats (1 fat serving is every 5g of extra oil, butter, you get the picture)\\nThis combination of food equals roughly 2000 cal. (try not to get caught up in the numbers, this will only make you crazy)\\nAlso, try eating this combination of food in the form of 3 meals and 3 snacks. Every meal and snack should consist of a carbohydrate source (such as fruit/vegetables, grains) and a protein source (dairy or meat). This combination helps you to feel full and satisfied (as well as keeps your metabolism working) throughout the day. Try aiming for 2 food groups for snacks and at least three food groups for meals. Always try to eat breakfast within the first half hour of waking up then have a snack about 2 and a half hours later, then lunch 2 and a half hours later then.....you get it, this way until bed time snack. I don't advise withdrawing from food to begin with your body is always prepared to be treated well :-).\\nHope this helps, it can be time consuming but in the end you will feel better then you ever have and your body thanks you for it.\\nGood luck and happy birthday!\n\nAnswer:",

But most real-world reactions aren't like that.  The reaction rate tends to slow down as product is created.  If one used just the right amounts of reactants to produce the theoretically possible amount of product, one might wait a very long time, or forever: many reactions just reach an equilibrium, and never go to completion.  So, you use a large excess of one of the reactants, which causes all, or almost all, of the other reactant to be converted.\n\nAnswer:",

The thinness of air and difficulty breathing and tiring from physical exertion occurs around 5,000 feet or even 6,000 feet or higher. Now 2,000 meters, that would have an impact with altitude. However, I believe goats are much faster than chickens so the answer is no, a chicken cannot outrun a goat a 200 meters above sea level. I believe a goat would easily outdistance the chicken in a race without any problems whatsoever. No contest. A chicken only runs about 9 miles per hour. A goat is much faster.\\n\\nAlso, if you scroll down to the bottom of this second link you will see the speeds of various animals.\n\nAnswer:",

You need to consider what happened with your last relationship. Was it something he did? Was it something you did? Try to figure that out first. That way, if you do choose to start over, you can fix it.\\n\\nNext, decide if your relationship can be salvaged at all at this point. Has too much gone wrong between you? If so, then make a clean break. Or can you be together without getting too awkward? Do you think there's too much pain, or do you think you can be together without having what went wrong throbbing in your heart each day? If so, then you may be able to save your relationship.\\n\\nAnd finally, do you want to start over as friends? So far, your husband's intentions and attempt seem genuine; it seems that he really wants to save your relationship by going back to the beginning and fixing the things that went wrong the first time around. Are you willing to go back to square one? And are you ready for if it doesn't work out?\\n\\nIf you choose to do this, then I think he's right when he says to take it slow. It would be hard, and expecting everything to fix itself quickly would make it harder; it's expecting too much. Chances are, it might even take longer than the first time around because last time, there wasn't the awkwardness or discomfort of a marriage gone down. It's risky, and it won't be easy.\\n\\nWhatever you choose, good luck and I wish you the very best.\n\nAnswer:",

I have a LOT of fears and suffer from depression, anxiety and panic attacks, for which I'm on medication and under the care of a psychiatrist.\\n\\nOne of my main fears seems to be a fear of the dark. I haven't always been scared of the dark, this has only been over the past year or two and seems to be getting worse. I get really panicky when it's dark - I have to have a baby's night light in my room at night or I have a panic attack as soon as I put the light off. But there are other situations which can be embarrassing - the other night I was watching TV with my flatmate and he put the light off......I managed to cope OK until he switched off the TV and we were plunged into darkness, then I got really panicky and it was embarrassing to say the least.\\n\\nHow can I get over this? I feel like such a baby!\nAnswer: well firstly and most importantly stop feeling embarassed... i am 27 and afraid of the dark since i was a little girl... so? what? since it's not something that you have since childhood probably your generalised anxiety triggered it as well as other fears and phobias too. so feeling embarassed just makes you feel more anxious and therefore intesifies your fear of dark. leave a small light on in your room (like a baby's night light) and try one step at the time. For example try not to lock your door once or twice a week. Admit to your flatmates you are afraid of dark. When you ll do that you will find out they are afraid of other things too or maybe that they even share the fear of darkness. This will allow you to be less anxious and them being more considerate. Over the years I have realised that you have to manage your fears like climbing. Rule number one: admit the mountian is high! Rule number 2: never look at the top. Always focus on the little step you take. You ll reach the top before you know it...\n\nAnswer:",

But they said public confidence in their work had been weakened by a sham branded by experts as the most visible case of scientific fraud they could recall.\\n\\nScientists also struggled to explain how they didn't earlier catch the charismatic South Korean veterinarian's claim in a Science paper published in May that he cloned 11 human embryos to produce stem cells.\\n\\n\"That's a difficult one,'' said Keith Campbell, the University of Nottingham researcher who helped clone Dolly the sheep in 1997. \"Scientists are asked to referee a lot of papers and to a certain extent we have to believe each other as to the validity of the data.''\\n\\nA disgraced Hwang Woo-suk resigned from Seoul National University on Friday after the school said the researcher fabricated groundbreaking cloning and stem-cell research that had raised hopes of new cures for hard-to-treat diseases.\\n\\nWhen Hwang published findings in February 2004 and again in May, it was believed he had developed a new cloning method that enabled him to accomplish something no one else had.\\n\\nHwang chalked up much of the success to South Korean government support and dedicated researchers working around the clock. He also credited his workers' dexterity with chopsticks; stem cell researchers visited from around the world and rushed back to their labs to try the new technique.\n\nAnswer:",

The thing is...I'm not very good talking to men.  (and it isn't my youth- I'm thirty).  I get very nervous one-on-one, and all thoughts escape me.  What kinds of conversation starters would you recommend?  How can I sound like myself when I don't do well carrying on good conversations with new people?  And this is just a phone call!\nAnswer: Think of some good open ended questions you can ask and some topics you feel comfortable talking about. Have a gameplan that you feel okay with and let the conversation just flow from there. \\n\\nAlso, positive thinking, quit telling yourself you are bad at one on one conversations. Tell yourself you are improving at them. Keep thinking that way and it won't be long til you do.\\n\\nRemember you have nothing to lose and he is going to be talking to you because he wants to know you. He'll give you all the time in the world to come up with the right words and he's probably nervous too. Also, just be honest that you get nervous talking one on one sometimes. No guy is going to fault you for that. Most likely he'll be flattered.\n\nAnswer:",

Do non-drinkers live in regular?\nQuestion: I'm a high school senior filling out my college forms and trying to decide between regular and sub-free housing. I don't plan on getting wasted every weekend, and don't want my room to be a party place. I also don't want a roommate who comes home and vomits everywhere. However, I also want to meet a lot of new people, and don't want to limit myself to one group. Any advice?\nAnswer: From my experience, \"substance-free\" refers to alcohol and smoking.  There is no smoking allowed within a certain distance of the front of the building and no alcohol allowed.  Regular dorms are less strict though I doubt smoking would be allowed inside anywhere and drinking is definitely restricted to 21 and over.  There is probably a mix of students within both types though the substance free is probably more students that refrain from substances.  Really, this would be a personal preference and my substance free dorm was where most of the athletes lived though I saw plenty of substances discretely.  I'd suggest calling the school and finding out the difference.  Don't worry about not meeting people in either type of dorm.

I don't know who to believe, because my family says I'm thin and I don't need to lose any weight, but when I look in the mirror I always see a fat girl. Oh, and what parents would say to their children that they are fat and ugly, anyway?\nAnswer: You are right, what parent would tell their child they were fat!?\\n\\nDo one thing, next time you are at the doctor's office have the nurse weigh you and then ask the doctor how you compare to other healthy girls your age.  Then you will know if you are just being crazy or if you should watch what you eat.\\n\\nIf you should watch what you eat, then try this first:\\n\\nStop drinking sodas!(or pick the worst thing you do regularly, like eat french fries, or drink whole milk and stop that one thing).\\n\\nThen do this next:\\n\\nReplace your worst habit with a good habit.  Drink diet sodas (I know sometimes they taste bad, but it is better than nothing, even if it isn't quite as good as drinking a lot of H20).\\n\\nEasy right!  Just stop one thing and replace it with one thing.  Do it until you feel you love what you do.  It will help you to feel a bit skinnier, and successful.  You are being healthy!  Awesome.  Now, you can try another thing...like....you be creative.....always improving is what it is all about.\\n\\nOne last thing; if a new food or habit should come along (ie smoking) save yourself the trouble of having to quit it in the future.....don't start bad habits.

Considering your ages, I am surpised that your parents are so restrictive. Ask yourself, what is this 'bad' that they think you're doing? Did your parents come from deeply religious families? Were your parents also restricted by their parents? What about her parents? It may not be fair, or make a whole lot of sense these days, but that could explain some of their methods. Do you or your girlfriend have troubled pasts, maybe trouble with the law? Did you ever have a truancy problem with school? Don't think that I am blaming their behavior on you, I just want you to think of all  possibile reasons. It almost sounds like you two live a bit far away from eachother, and that might explain why you're only allowed to see eachother twice a week, and talk on the phone for only half an hour a day. Have I nailed it yet? No? Okay, parents may not seem to make any sense some of the time, but they are your parents. Like it or not they have say into your relationships. The more you show respect for them and their wishes, usually the more trust they'll have for you. So if you're considering sneaking around after dark or anything like that, don't try it. Chances are you'll get caught, and just imagine how often you'd get to see her then? Probably not at all. I know this is a hard time for you both, you're almost legal adults, but until you turn the magic age of 18, you just have to bite down and endure this. You will get through this, just be patient with her and your parents. I am going to assume that talking with your parents wont make much of a difference, but there is nothing wrong with trying. Ask them what it is that they fear so much, and do your best to put that fear to rest. Assure them that you intend to follow their wishes, and do so when you're out with her. If they see that you're true to your word, the less likely they are to shorten the leash. I get the feeling that their fear is your sexual activity. It is my personal opinion that you two are at the ages when your sexuality is your business, however a parent will feel like your business is always their business. You can be 50 years old, and they'll still consider you their baby. Being that your sexuality is your business, I hope you wont mind if I give you a piece of advice: protect you and your girlfriend and use a condom every time. Anyway, you will get through this, I promise. Good luck.\n\nAnswer:",

She is so afraid to try to work things out because I would always hurt her with my insecurities, for example, like telling her to find someone that deserves her when we have an argument. How can I change so I don't hurt her anymore?\nAnswer: you have to think about why it is that you feel this way. why do you think you aren't good enough for her. once you figure this out you can start the healing process within yourself. it's okay to argue.. it's part of life. the tough part is how you are going to handle it and manning up to any mistakes you may have made. that is the true test of a relationship. this doesn't mean that you don't deserve her. if anything.. she's putting you on to things so you are aware how you are hurting her, yourself, and the relationship. if she says she loves you .. believe it. communication is the key. have a talk with her and try to sort out your feelings. if you really love her .. try and work it out. but you gotta trust her. live and let go.. easier said than done.. but you'll be happier in the long run with the one you love.. hope it helps..\n\nAnswer:",

Much like the FLOW label?\nAnswer: Okay, I've been Snowboarding for over twenty years, worked for a snowboard company (Avalanche Snowboards/Universal Bindings) where I was the Assistant Binding Production Manager for 4 years, spent 4 years as a snowboard rental shop manager and now manage a Winter Sports Retail Store.\\n\\nPlease, don't believe the hype that step-in bindings are dangerous. That is completely and utterly untrue. With proper care and maintenance they are just as safe as the traditional ratchet bindings. People find them a bit more inconvenient than the ratchet type as they are susceptible to clogging with snow, the boots are usually either too stiff or too soft and there are fewer choices of boots to choose from. They are very popular with rental shops as they are much more durable, dependable and fit a wide range of boot sizes more easily than ratchet types. Also, crossover boarders  (former skiers) particularly older ones find it more similar to what they were used to on ski's and find them easier on their backs as there is less bending over. Keep in mind that Step-in bindings are becoming less and less popular and many manufacturers have stopped production on them.\\n\\nI prefer ratchet bindings myself. I like Burton P1 Carbons and I'm really excited to try out Burton's CO2's next season. I've ridden flow bindings and I don't like them as much. They are very easy to use and very comfortable but I cannot get them tight enough to get the response I am use to. I run a very stiff set-up with my P1 Carbons and Driver X boots. I have talked to tons of people who really like Flow bindings but they just aren't for me.\\n\\nAlways be honest with yourself about your skill level and style of riding when purchasing equipment. If all you do is cruise intermediate runs then you don't need the craziest, most high performance setup on the planet. You'll be much happier with equipment designed for your or just slightly above your ability level. Companies like Burton, Drake, Tech 9, Flow, Ride and K2 all make quality products.\\n\\nGiven a choice, get a binding with as many adjustment options as possible. I have found that not all bindings fit the same and the more choices you have to make a binding fit your boot better the more comfortable you will be.\\n\\nHope that helped.\n\nAnswer:",

How many dollars did he carry in the begining?\nAnswer: He has $7\\n\\nHis money at thew start is X; after the first church, he has 2X (doubled) - 8 (donation); in the second church, (2X-8)*2 - 8; in the third (4X-24)*2 - 8. So since he has no money anymore then, 8X-56 = 0, which makes X=7.\n\nAnswer:",

You will need to contact the state that holds your court order child support and get a copy of all transactions and payments from you. On this report it will show exactly what you are in arrears or if you have a 0 balance at the time the report is printed. Most states are now centralized and usually Child support will have a 1-800 number to call. Make sure that you have your social security number or case number handy when you make your call.

Don't submit a resume that says you want an interesting job and leave it to the employer to decide where to put you. He or she will drop your resume in the garbage. You need a sentence like you want to find a sales job where you can use your strong interpersonal skills for example. Most people get their jobs from people they know so talk to people you know and let them know you are looking for work. You can also get the telephone book and call places you would like to work. For example, if you want to do mortgages, go to the yellow pages and call mortgage companies and get the name of the person to fax or mail your resume to.\n\nAnswer:",

They have no effect in increasing the natural capacity of the erectile chambers, which is a necessity if permanent gains are to be achieved. There are no well-documented scientific studies of the long-term effects of pumping. However, excessive pumping or the use of a too intense vacuum can have detrimental side effects. Lymph blisters are common and men often notice a reduction in sensitivity and problems achieving firm erections. Moreover, burst or ruptured blood vessels can lead to bruising and at worst even hemorrhaging.\\n\\nFor these reasons, only pumps with an accurate and reliable pressure gauge should ever be used and instructions should always be followed carefully.\n\nAnswer:",

As the cells age  their walls start to break down and cannot retain the stain. They lose layers of their peptioglycan or the teichoic acid isn't as effective. I hope that helps.\n\nAnswer:",

They have one of there best squads ever in there history. I also think they will advance with argentina out of the group stages, leaving holland behind, i agree with you comlpetely. argentina has more of a balanced team, so it will be tough for Ivory Coast to find a weak spot to attack, and they have Riquelme in the midfield who can dictate games and be a field general. Holland have some great player like Ruud Van Nistelrooy, but aren't as balanceed as Argentina, so i think ivory coast will be able to break them down much easier and win.

I mean how would it help me out in my career?\nAnswer: Law school teaches you more than just \"the law,\" it teaches you how to think like a lawyer.  Legal professions approach problems systematically, and in a way that many people are not used to thinking.  The legal reasoning begins with a rule, then an application to the facts that leads to a conclusion, while people who are not lawyers tend to come to a conclusion, then find facts that support it.\\n\\nEven though the law changes constantly, you must learn how to research and understand the law.  This is only done through guidance and practice.  Although one can tell what a law is from a statute, a lawyer can find case law to see how the court interpreted it, and find history that may shed light on how it may be applied in the future.  And it takes skills learned over a period of time to learn how to extract the law from a case, or to even find a relevant case.\\n\\nYou learn research skills, crtitical thinking skills, and ethical standards at law school, along with the fundamentals of major topic areas.  You learn black letter law that will be tested on the bar exam.  You need to attend law school to learn the techniques needed to research law for your client, learn how to write in a legal form, and how to practice ethically.  None of these things can be gained from merely memorizing the law.\\n\\nIf you are planning to practice law as a career, these are the skills you will need.

And how many units equals an Associates Degree? And Bachelors? And Masters? And Ph.D?\nAnswer: Depends on the University and the program, they are all different and measure units differently.  Northwestern measures units as individual classes so one class equals one credit, while other schools measure a credit hour based on how many hours of class you have each week in that class and so on.  For associates typically, 60 hours, Bachelors 120 hours.  A masters depends on the program and where you go.  A lot of masters degrees are 24-30 hours beyond a Bachelors but you can't take the same amount of classes at a time.  A Ph.D. can take from 3-7 years depending on the degree and program beyond your masters.  It all depends in what and where you go.\n\nAnswer:",

I have also given it to my family members and they too have had their \"cold time\" greatly reduced.\\n\\nI also take 1000 mg C in the morning and another dose 12 hours later.\\n\\nhttp://www.airbornehealth.com/main.html\n\nAnswer:",

Each species of mammal has at least one kind of \"hair\" or fur. Many species have several different specialized types. For example, cat whiskers are very different from regular cat fur in texture and length. One of the main differences in hair is whether it is determinate in length (grows to a certain length and stops) or indeterminate in length (grows for as long as it is alive.) Humans have both kinds in different places on the body. Head hair, scalp and face, is indeterminate. Body hair, arms, underarms, legs, pubic area, fingers and toes is determinate. The only determinate hairs on the head are normal eyebrows, ear hair and nose hairs. I think the reason is obvious. \"Wild hairs\" are determinate hairs that have encountered a genetic failure. The length possibilities of each type of hair from sheep's wool to seal fur are genetically determined.  Pubic hair is a secondary sex characteristic that signals availability for mating. It is not designed to cover, conceal, protect, or warm the area that produces it. It may have some scent retaining or focusing function too. This is still debatable. I hope this helps.\n\nAnswer:",

How did god create himself if he wasn't extant in the first place to create himself?\\n\\n(Not to say that I totally accept the big bang theory, either)\nAnswer: Well....let's look at this logically:  The universe (including time itself) can be shown to have had a beginning.\\n\\nIt is unreasonable to believe something could begin to exist without a cause.  Stephen Hawking says this.\\n\\nThe universe, therefore, requires a cause, just as Genesis 1:1 and Romans 1:20 teach.\\n\\nNow - this is important to understand:  God, as the creator of time, is outside of time. Since therefore He has no beginning in time, He has always existed, so doesn't need a cause.\\n\\nGod did not \"create Himself\".  \\n\\nThink outside of the box.  Outside of dimensions.

It's unlikely you will require a website with this type of infrastructure.  You can build yourself a free website if you're just starting out at http://geocities.yahoo.com/ or http://www.v3.com/.\\n\\nThere's also plenty of free web templates on sites like macromedia http://www.macromedia.com/software/dreamweaver/download/templates/\\nor if you like flash you can use http://www.flashloaded.com/templates/freetemplates/\\n\\nThere really is an unlimited amount of resources out there to build your own website for free, especially if you're just starting out.

The scientific community knows little about viruses, and the HIV virus is constantly mutating, making it difficult to find something that would stop it.

Is your assignment to argue that retribution is socially cohesive, or did you come up with this yourself?\\n\\nThis is what I can think of:\\n\\nRetributive justice is based on the idea that criminals should be punished for undermining social \"harmony\" or \"balance.\"  Therefore, we can't dole out retributive punishment before we first have a definition of what is social harmony or balance.  Social harmony and balance can be defined through laws, custom, or religion.  The PROCESS of defining social harmony and balance is socailly cohesive because, to some extent, we must generally agree on what the definition of social order is.  In other words, the PROCESS of accepting and agreeing on laws/customs/religion is socially cohesive.\\n\\nThe rehabilitation theory of punishment is probably the most socially cohesive because it is based on rehabiliting the criminal so that he can successfully reenter society.\n\nAnswer:",

When the contents of the colon pass through more slowly there is an opportunity for toxins and carcinogens (substances which may induce cancer) to be in prolonged contact with the bowel wall which is where cancer starts.  Fiber, docusate sodium, and milk of magnesia (depending upon various factors) should regulate your bowel habit without the need for laxatives.\n\nAnswer:",

The doctor also will listen to your lungs to determine the extent and kind of weasing, crackles, and other indications.  You probably will have a chest xray (CXR), possibly a CT scan. Be sure you understand what the doctor tells you.  If you are prescribed asthma inhalers, such as Albuterol, Atrovent, Advair, and they don't really help you after a couple of months, then do get another opinion.  I know someone who was told she had adult onset asthma, then also some emphysema.  After three years of getting worse, she went to a university/teaching hospital and found that she had neither.  If you \"think\" you have asthma, then maybe your symptoms aren't too bad, but they can get much worse.  It's a good idea to keep a time record of significant problems or symptoms for future reference, and for your doc or a new doc.  Also obtain copies of test results to have in case you do go to a new doc.  Hope asthma is all you have, you can still have a basically normal life.\n\nAnswer:",

Do you mean when the planet itself is utterly disintegrated? Are you referring to a Biblical apocalypse?\\n\\nTo any of these conditions, no one can say. However, to the first one listed, our continued destruction of the environment continues to lead to more polluted air, ground, and water. And, while the melting of the ice caps will raise water a great deal and wipe out coastal cities and land, it certainly can't cover the entire planet. Stubborn as humans are, we'll probably find some way to survive through technology if we mess things up that badly, which would be extremely sad to have destroyed such beauty. We also might start a nuclear war that kills everything but cockroaches, but the planet itself would still be here. \\n\\nCondition two, where the planet is disintegrated, could be brought about by several ways, as well. A large comet, asteroid, or meteor might smash into earth, breaking it apart and causing it to no longer technically be a planet. When the sun finally goes nova (estimated to be 5 billion years away), if it reaches this far out, which his possible, it would swallow the earth, likely blowing it to bits. Then there's always the \"Hitchhiker's Guide\" route, where we'll be destroyed for an intergalactic highway.\\n\\nAs for the Bible, only the Father knows. Not even Christ knows when it'll happen. People have been incorrectly interpreting the signs for hundreds of years, so all the tabloid doomsday people are probably just as wrong now.\\n\\nIn short, no one can see the future, and you're right. We don't take good care of our planet. We really should appreciate it more while we still have a planet to enjoy! Who knows, tomorrow someone might throw a nuke, so go out and enjoy earth! And just in case someone doesn't start World War III, go and take care of it, too, so that generations far into the future can look back on this time and say, \"Wow, look at all they did for their children and their children's children,\" instead of, \"How on earth could they be so selfish and uncaring?\"\n\nAnswer:",

Are those some special effects used by the democrats to undermine their arguments???\nAnswer: The Earth's climate in general is going slowly thru a warming phase much as it has many times. How do you think the ice age ended? Global warming... way before man could have possibly affected the climate. Global warming comes from the sun, period. There are a few slight factors involved. Greenhouse gasses, such as carbom dioxide, hold the Earth's heat from escaping back into space. Gasses commonly called pollution, such as sulfur dioxide, reflect the sun's energy back into space. Here's where it gets tricky... over the last 30 years or so, we've cleaned up the pollution but have added more carbon dioxide to the Earth's atmosphere. Now, more of the sun's energy reaches the surface and more is held in, hence \"global warming\". \\n\\nFor the second part of your question... All of the so-called \"experts\" predicted a nasty hurricane season again this year. What happened? Did the republicans somehow blow the hurricans back out to sea to increase their chances of re-election? If so, they should have advertised it, 'cause they didn't do so well...\n\nAnswer:",

Its funny because I actually asked a very very similar question today.  I have a similar situation as you, as I am suffering from incontinence.

I'm in a similar process myself.  \\n\\nI have to wear \"protective undergarments\" right now because of this.  I'll be honest:  I hate it.  I feel like a baby sometimes.  And in public its the only thing on my mind.\\n\\nBut I have to remain both realistic and optimistic.  If there is help for me (and you), we're going to find.  But we have to look.  And I know that in the meantime I have to be aware of my condition and I can't ignore it.  I don't like having accidents, but I would like it less if I wasnt trying to fix the problem.  Its the best we can do. \\n\\nFeel free to email me (I think you can get to the address in my profile) if you want to talk more about it!\n\nAnswer:",

Put a decoration up here or there, make a meal, side dish, or dessert out of your stock of family Christmas favorites.\\n\\nSome people just get overwhelmed with Christmas and relentless pressure to shop, decorate, be cheery. I don't know if it's urban legend, but I've heard that suicides go up around Christmas. (Not to suggest that's where your mum's heading, just that there are a lot of different pressures and expectations sometimes associated with Christmas.)\\n\\nDo you know what your mum likes about Christmas? What makes her happy about it, if anything? Maybe it's the shopping, cooking, decorating, eating, seeing friends and family - if you could work those out without being overbearing about quizzing her on it, you might be able to help provide a more happy and comfortable Christmas environment for her.\\n\\nI've known one or two folks that were most happy at Christmas getting AWAY from family by taking a vacation, preferably in a warm location. It's just that some people have conflicting or negative associations with holidays.\\n\\nMyself, I like Thanksgiving Day (USA) more than Christmas. I like giving out presents and seeing little kids happy, but Turkey-day just seems more low-key and relaxed.\\n\\nOh, and sometimes, as people get older, they just aren't as thrilled with some things as they used to be. I guess it just gets to be old hat or they're focused on things that have gone bad in the past or people that are no longer around, things are no longer the same, etc.\\n\\nGood luck!\n\nAnswer:",

You should not allow it to grow in your home anywhere.  \\n\\nWhen we lived in Italy we had a really bad mold problem and would have to wipe the walls down with bleach and water once a week.  At first we did not know why we all were getting sick. We first began to notice that when we would leave the house we would feel better.  We thought it was just allergies because we were new in the environment at first, but we got worse.  After visiting the doctor and him knowing we were new to Italy he asked about the mold in the house.\n\nAnswer:",

How do you learn what to do?\nAnswer: Go to a gentleman's establishment with a few friends and watch the dancers. That way you can take note of what they do and try to learn them yourselves. If you feel silly ask your friends to help you and practice with you.  If not I'm sure there is a video out there that can give you some moves. Just practice and make sure you feel comfortable with yourself. Even if you feel silly, don't show it. Keep your head up and shoulders back and you'll own the place. Good Luck.\\n\\nIt's also a good form of exercise, good for toning muscles.\\nA lot of woman hates those places because they think they are degrading, or because men they know go to them (they are insecure). When in fact there are also male strippers out there. Don't let that discourage you, you do what you want.\n\nAnswer:",

Yea, I hate exercising and have had a lot of success in the past w/ products like the original Diet Fuel and T-Burn - both w/ ephedra.  So when they took ephedra off the market, I started trying everything under the sun.  I bought Hoodia online and tried it for 2 straight weeks; it was like taking a sugar pill.  I had absolutely no beneficial side affects from it at all - No increased energy, No suppressed appetite, and No increased metabolism.  I was actually more dehydrated when I was taking it which is just the opposite of what it claims.\\n\\nDon't waste your money - I started walking everyday for 40 mins and now I'm 15 lbs thinner! =)\n\nAnswer:",

An outbreak is triggered by stress and illness ( severe colds, flu). It is extremely contagious and can be spread to other parts of your body- eyes, anus, mouth, nose, if proper hygiene is not used.( frequent handwashing). The most common prescription for Herpes Simplex I and II is called Acyclovir or Zovirax. There is NO CURE for Herpes, so if you get them, you are prone to outbreaks for life. Having Herpes increases your chances of contracting AIDS and decreasing your life span by 10%.\n\nAnswer:",

I've been trying desperatly to gain some weight. Idealy, I want to be around 114lbs. iIam underweight. My doctor told me that I'm supposed to weight 114lbs.  So far I am having alot of trouble gaining that extra weight. Is there anyone who could tell me how I might go about this in a healthy way? I also want to find out what type of strength exercises I could do to keep my body toned after I have reached the weight I want. I should probably mention that the reason I am trying to gain extra weight is the fact that I would like to add curves to my body. Although I am a fairly small girl I will admit that my weight is proportional to my height. I do however have an A-cup chest and am trying to gain weight to increase my size. I'm aware that this may not work but while I'm still young I may as well see what kind of results I get. I'm trying to find jeans that r my size but they fit me 2 loose. has any tips for me please let me know.\nAnswer: actually, you should be around 90-100 i would say because you are so short. i have a friend whos your height and shes about 85-90 i think. as long as your healthy, your at a perfect weight. you probably have a small frame size too. dont try and get to 114, you dont need to. your goal should be around 100-105. start weight lifting or working out; load up on protein and carbs. count your calories and make sure you eat more than you burn-this will make you gain weight. after you gain the weight and you think you want to tone up, start swimming. i know i say this to like every answer but swimming is so good for exercise. it tones your whole body with faster results than running and there is no pressure on your joints.\\nim sort of in your same situation. im 5'5\" and only 100 or so and im trying to gain healthy (like, pure muscle) weight. my goal is 105. \\ngood luck!=]\n\nAnswer:",

His Ex is My best friend. She Still Likes Him. He hates her. That  \"Ex Boyfriend \" Is Now my boyfriend. (his name is John) (My best friend's name is Haley)\\nJohn Hates Haley. Haley is in luv wit him. I LOVE JOHN. and haley is going out with a boy she doesnt even like and shes doing that to make John jealous. She Thinks He Still likes her. Haley Thinks He is going out with me 2 make her jealous. ME and John are fine we love each other. But Haley, (my now x-best friend) likes him still. Me and John have been going out for a month and a week. And i dont want us 2 end. Please Give Me advice 2 get rid of Haley. (without any murder please) Give Me advice to help out please!\nAnswer: Wow.  Well, there is nothing you can really do to control the outcome of this situation, that depends on who truly has feelings for who.  I think John probably really likes you and not Haley, because if he still liked Haley he would probably be already trying to get back together with her by now.  I think Haley just wants to believe he still likes her because she likes him, and people can make themselves belief what they really want to believe.  \\n\\nIt is kind of disturbing that you would date your friend's ex especially when you know she still likes him.  Maybe you two aren't truly friends?  I guess you can just stop hanging out with Haley.  And she can't come between you and John if John truly likes you and not her, right?\\n\\nSo I guess just tell Haley that you think she is kind of obsessed with John, and John is with you now, and you are sorry but you really have feelings for John, so you think it's best if you and she don't hang out for awhile.  This will hurt her, but I guess she needs to get the message that John is taken now, and she needs to back off.\n\nAnswer:",

There are also  people who interfere in anothers life because they feel that anyone different from themselves must be made to be more like them. The fact is, people will always be resentful of those who are different, because of fear, which is generated from ignorance. Or because they're just plain jealous.

That being said, children learn best through play. A child builds mathmatical concepts at a very early age, though they do not know it as \"math.\" You may not even recognize it as math. \\n\\nAs a child plays with blocks, they are building geometric concepts about shapes and spatial reasoning. They may not even be able to name the shapes, but as they try to build a tower with the blocks, they are using problem solving skills to keep the tower from falling. \\n\\nProblem solving also comes into play with such simple activities as hide and seek or memory/matching games. With a memory game, a child learns to think about the tiles they have turned over already, realizing which ones might match. Also, when a child presents a problem to you through play activity, like \"I can't do it. How can I...?\" Don't just answer it for them. Problem solve with them. Problem solving abilities will be critical for them throughout school.\\n\\nReasoning skills are another mathematical concept. These are easily practiced through games and sorting acitvities. Promote this skill by asking questions like:\\nAre you sure?\\nHow do you know?\\nWhy do you think...?\\n\\nFoster communication skills. Children must be able to clearly communicate their thoughts in order to explain their steps in solving problems or in trying to understand new concepts. Reading to children is the single most important activity you can do as a parent. Reading skills will help a child in every subject area.\\n\\nI could go on and on. I guess what I think is most important is to allow your child to play. They will learn and remember what they learn longer.\n\nAnswer:",

I have a choice to read it for extra credit, should I?\nAnswer: Reviews and Commentary\\n(http://www.petehautman.com/invisibleinfo.html)  \\n\\nLIBRARY JOURNAL (starred review) \\n\\nSeventeen-year-old Dougie takes everything literally, lacks social graces and is a loner, except, perhaps, for his one friend, athletic and popular Andy Morrow. But readers know almost immediately that something tragic has happened in the recent past: ' Andy and I had some bad luck with fires when we were kids. We're more careful now.' Other students feel threatened by Dougie's disturbing behavior and react by targeting him with cruelty and violence, which only serves to escalate his descent into unreality, isolation, and obsession. The teen has been working for nearly three years on his model railroad set, using 22, 400 headless matches to build a bridge connecting portions of the 'Madham Line.' As his life deteriorates, this obsession and his nightly talks with Andy are the only things that keep him clinging to normalcy. He resists the help of his psychiatrist and hides his medication. Ultimately, he is forced to remember what actually happened on that fateful night. With its excellent plot development and unforgettable, heartbreaking protagonist, this is a compelling novel of mental illness. \\n\\n  \\n\\nHORN BOOK (starred review) \\n\\nGifted in math, and recognizably clever when constructing architectural models (he's building an elaborate railroad system in his basement), Doug reveals that it's human interaction he can't figure out. \"I'm a quiet kid, pretty much invisible,\" he says in a precise, unemotional voice, as this unreliable narrator begins his story. Invisibility is Doug's rationale for explaining a range of rejection, from teacher irritation to peer scorn, particularly from pretty and popular Melissa Haverman, who is disgusted by what readers will recognize as Doug's stalker behavior. But Doug reports one near-perfect relationship, the one he has with his best friend, Andy. Gradually, however, that friendship is revealed to be not what it seems. There are secrets from their past that Doug won't discuss, and hints from their present life that skew his tale. Why is there a strange man in Andy's house? What fuels Doug's increasingly complex rendering of their intertwined initials? What medication is Doug refusing to take? Reading this psychological thriller is much like putting together one of Doug's railroad bridges: connections are being made, but the realities being built may be imitations of life rather than the real thing. The tension comes from entering Doug's private hell and learning what put him there. \\n\\n  \\n\\nPUBLISHERS WEEKLY (starred review) \\n\\nThe strength of Hautman's painfully sad novel is the wisecracking but clearly unreliable voice of its narrator, 17-year-old Douglas MacArthur Hanson who admits, \"I'm not only disturbed, I'm obsessed.\" One of his passions is \"Madham,\" a town he's building for his model railroad, complete with a 1:800 scale replica of the Golden Gate Bridge. He's also fixated on a pretty girl who clearly wants nothing to do with him. And he's overly reliant on his only friend, Andy Morrow, a fellow junior who is the popular and outgoing yang to Dougie's outcast and introverted yin. Hautman expertly teases out the truth about a tragic incident that occurred \"at the Tuttle place\" three years earlier, a mystery that propels the story to its horrific conclusion. Dougie is as mathematically gifted and socially inept as the autistic narrator of Mark Haddon's The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time, but he also has a sophisticated wit. During a lapse in conversation at one of his $95-an-hour therapy sessions, he observes, \"We stare at each other for about $1.40.\" His self-deprecating comments and wry observations make his spiral into self destruction all the more heartbreaking.

I am 18 and I feel it is important for me to have a healthy body. What kinds of exercise can I do that will not cause weight loss?\nAnswer: have u tried lifting weights? you might be feeling weaker when you do a lot of cardio and its draining your energy. lifting weights gives u that adrenaline rush that overcomes that. and maybe u arnt eating enough? if thats the case then try more calorie dense foods.\n\nAnswer:",

Andrei can really fill up the stat sheet able to get a lot of rebounds, steals, assists, and blocks.  However, Kirilenko has a propensity for getting hurt.\\n\\nIn all honesty, I'd never get him in the first round because of his constant bout with injuries.\\n\\nLastly, always remember never to trade for an injured player, unless you can pick them up off the waiver wire/Free agent list :)\\n\\nHope this helps.\n\nAnswer:",

Basically all research quality microscopes do have a place where you can attach either a digital or a camera which uses film as long as it is a SLR camera and you can take the camera lens off (you basically attach the microscope instead of the lens in front of your camera). If you use a film camera, you may have to work out proper exposure times and be very careful with proper focusing. With a digital camera it is easier to check as you can look at the image you just took if it came out OK. Normally you can also attach digital cameras to a computer and see a large version of the image you took on the computer screen. \\nYou won't get any good images holding a regular camera in front of an eyepiece like where you put your eye. For one thing it is difficult to hold the camera consitently in the correct place. Another is that light falling in from the side will be bad for the image quality. I think also the size of the image there may not be large enough to allow you to take an image of a high resolution.\\nThere are also cameras you can buy which you can put onto your eyepiece instead of the ocular lens. They give decent images.\n\nAnswer:",

He came home from a hard day of running around to find he had nothing in his room but a pillow and one cover.  Since he paid no bills, he wasn't allowed to use my electric, my air conditioning, his stereo, NOTHING.  He was allowed to sleep in his room from 10:00 P.M. until 8:00 A.M.  The rest of the time he was not allowed in the house.  He was allowed to eat breakfast, get a drink of water and use the head before he left.  When he was able to pay me $5.oo per week, he regained his room 24 hrs.  When He was able to pay me $5.00 more per week. he got back his stereo and T.V.  He took three weeks to tell me he had a job (at MacDonald's).  Before the month was over he was able tp pay me $20.00 per week to have his normal room back.  I put all the money in an account for him and 6 months later  he had a down payment on a car.  Now he has a better job (construction), a girl friend he can afford and a car with insurance.  I believe that he hated me at first, but now, every once in a while, he says, Poppa, thanks for making me get up off my butt.  Things are so much more enjoyable.\n\nAnswer:",

Electrical resonance is not generally related to mechanical resonance.  It would be possible, with considerable calculation and inventiveness to put together a device which vibrated in time with or at a harmonic fraction of its electrical resonant frequency, but it would be a real academic undertaking.\\n.  There is no single equation to calculate the resonant frequency of \"an object\".  If you narrowly define the object as say \"a taut string\" or \"a circular plate\", equations of only a few terms can be derived for each of those cases, but the equations would not be the same for different cases.  There would be similarities, but they would have diffent constants and different variables.  Most objects would require the development of a complicated mathematical description of the interelatedness of the masses, elastic properties, dimensions, stiffnesses and coupling mechanics of the various components of the object in order to calculate a resonant frequency.  For some complex objects, which are dominated by a single large and simple structure, like say the cylindrical fuselage of an airplane, there are formulae to calculate the resonant frequency.  For objects like suspension bridges, or cable stayed bridges or skyscrapers, it is necessary to go through the pains of developing a mathematical model to find a range within which the object will resonate.  For most objects, you just build it, test it and then do something to eliminate undesirable resonances.\\n.  Pretty much the same can be said about calculating the electrical resonance of an object.\\n.  For simple resonant circuits there are straightforward formulae for calculating their resonant frequencies, but the formulae are different for different types of resonant circuits.  Whatever text I might have on resonance of electrical circuits is buried in a box somewhere, but should be able to find a book which includes these formuale and other electrical formulae at a college library, online or maybe even at some place like Radio Shack\u00ae.\n\nAnswer:",

The idea was to use a lot of small explosions in succession to create the sort of effect one gets with a continious burn from the usual chemical fueled rockets.\\n\\nThere were some small scale tests done with non-nuclear nukes, which suggested the concept wasn't crazy, but there was never any full scale tests, and certainly nothing using fission bombs.\\n\\nIt is not clear that scaling this concept up to the size needed for a manned rocket would be that feasible, although some disagree with that assesment. There would be a tremendous stress on the vehicle from all these explosions, especially if they were more contained (in order to harness more of the explosive power for thrust).\\n\\nBut, I don't think we'll ever see anything like this unless there is some sort of mass evacuation of the planet. (Not there is anywhere to go.) As you might expect, a Project Orion rocket is essentially the same as a huge number of atmospheric atomic explosions. Not exactly enviro-friendly, to say the least.\\n\\nIF by \"nuclear thermal\" propulsion you mean the generators used by some space probes to generate electricity, then these are far to weak for a manned vehicle. They couldn't supply the power to lift off from Earth, and a trip to the moon using an electric ion drive takes much, much longer than the more direct chemically driven Apollo trajectory. \\n\\nIon propulsion has tried on the space probe Deep Space 1, although this was not nuclear powered.\n\nAnswer:",

Is she ashamed??\nAnswer: I am a Democrat.\\n\\nIn 1998, I ran for public office in my town - and won. \\n\\nWhile campaigning, I never hesitated to display my party logo on my left lapel under the American flag. On all my signs and literature, the word DEMOCRAT was prominently placed for ALL to see.\\n\\nI challenge anyone who is running for public office to do the same. If a candidate is reluctant to display which party they are aligned to, then I say DON'T VOTE FOR THEM. That is the voter's first sign of a HIDDEN AGENDA.\n\nAnswer:",

Also, technically speaking, can one convert a gasoline- or diesel-burning engine into an ethanol-burning one? Or does the engine have to be designed and built that way from the factory? Thanks for sharing your knowledge.\nAnswer: sugar cane is recognized as having the least trouble creating ethanol. In Brazil this works wonderfully. They have removed the need to import oil and are actually exporting ethanol. In the US sugar cane doesn't grow as well. sugar cane is best in tropical climates. \\n\\nIn the US corn is the most common for ethanol. It isn't the best crop but is efficient enough for now. Industry best(meaning in the lab) for producing ethanol is above 1 btu of fuel produces 2 btus of ethanol. \\n\\nFor non-tropical climates cellulose based ethanol is also making big waves. It's advantages are that every living plant tissue is at least 80% cellulose. Dead tissue like wood is around 30 to 40 percent cellulose. A farmer could sell the normal corn seed, and then bale the corn stalks, which are usually left on the ground, for ethanol. Another advantage is that on irrigated and fertilized lands you can grow better than 10 tons of cellulose per acre per season if grown for harvesting cellulose verus the 2.5 tons per acre of corn seed. critiria for a plant for this process is a plant that grows a lost of mass per acre. \\n\\nEthanol is meant to replace gasoline fuel not diesel fuel.\\nDiesel engines don't have spark plugs, so they can't ignite high octane fuels like gasoline and ethanol. Instead they hammer-strike the better performing low octane deisel fuel. \\n\\nMost gas engines out there probably can be converted to work with ethanol. There are a number of conversion kits available. It is likely to work better however if they come from the factory. \\n\\nBio-deisel is wonderful for most diesel engines. I'm afraid I don't know a lot about that topic.\n\nAnswer:",

How come the Left keep telling lies about torture at Gitmo?\nAnswer: The military tribunals aren't good enough for those scumbags. They should be executed at daybreak tomorrow. Do you not think they would execute American soldiers if they were captured?\\nDo the people in this forum not read any history, or even watch the histoy channel? Those people in the Middle East hate our guts, They hate us even more than you could imagine that they hate us. They have been teaching their children for generations that we are the infidels. They have no respect for human life, as demonstrated by suicide bombers who kill women and children. If we let those people in Gitmo go free, they will surely kill us, or try to kill us. Maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow, but one day they will come for us. Don't you people care about future generations of Americans. These people do not need to be put in the hands of our criminal justice system. Do you have enough confidence in our system that these scumbags will be convicted, considering that murderers and rapists and child molesters are let loose everyday to strike again? Those scumbag extremist need to be executed. We are in a war, partially for oil, but its mostly about the survival of our western way of life. There are hundreds of millions of muslims out there who want us dead so that they can worhip their allah. They hate us all the way down to our souls. They are content to live in their mud huts and crap in the streets, are you ready to live like that? Are you ready to stop everything you are doing several times a day to kneel in the dirt, mud, snow, rain to worship allah?

I've heard you can't be deployed twice within a certain time span, is that true?

In the USMC, it's been 7 months there before the new guys show up.  They stay for seven months.  It's possible that as soon as you return, you'll start training to go back as the new guys replacements.  But that is what I am trying to do, and I am having a difficult time being put on a deployment.  There are more Marines willing to go than slots available.  Many Marines have gotten to go/had to go three times in one enlistment.  I've only gotten there once.  I've got a year left though.  Hopefully I'll make it back again.\n\nAnswer:",

My comuter has a built in fax modem. My computer makes a tone, but of course I don't have a phone line hooked up because I am using cable to access internet. So, Do I also need to pug in a phone line then? If so can I just hook line straight from wall jack to computer? Also, when I type in the number to be dialed do I put in dashes or spaces?\nAnswer: For starters, make sure you're plugging your cable from your wall to the correct jack in your modem.  One usually has a phone icon - don't use that one for the wall connection.  Use that for an actual phone.\\n\\nIf your hear a dial tone from your speakers when you try to fax someone, then that's a good thing - your fax is trying to start up and dial.  If you don't hear a dial tone, again check your plugs.  It may even help to check the wall outlet as well, since that may be part of the problem.\\n\\nAs for dialing, you can usually go either way with dashes or no dashes.  Just be sure to use area codes where necessary.\\n\\nNow be warned - sometimes sending a fax over a cable modem won't work out.  I've had that told to me once, and it turned out that it did work in my case.  But then recently, I tried to fax and they didn't go through all the way.  I had to do some fancy trickery to get things right again, but it worked out in the end.\\n\\nBTW, the link below is from Microsoft's website.

Everything?\nQuestion: what is there purpose? what are the advantages and didadvantages. what can they do for you.\nAnswer: It really upsets me to read an answer like the prejudiced person before me left for you.  She has no right to answer or give an opinion since she was never part of a Greek organization, although she clearly seems jealous that she wasn't....\\n\\nGreek life is wonderful and it can really enhance your college life, as well as later in life. I've remained close to many of my \"sisters\" over the years. Putting my sorority on my resume even helped my land a job at a big company. I was told by HR that people who've been in Greek organizations have a higher likelihood of being successful in the workplace than those who weren't. I don't know if it's true, but it's worth considering. \\n\\nMy significant other was in a fraternity and is still close with all of his \"brothers\" as well. They still have get togethers a few times a year and help out with their chapter when needed.\\n\\nDo not think or let anyone ever tell you that being in a sorority is like buying friends. ALL organizations have dues...even my son's PTA organization. The cost pays for the parties and other supplies needed for get togethers and charity events. It's no different than paying for any other organization.\\n\\nAs for disadvantages, I suppose you might close yourself off to other organizations, as they do take up a lot of time.  Greek organizations are not just about partying, contrary to popular belief.  We partied hard, but we also participated in Adopt A Highway, Soup Kitchens, local elementary schools, donated money to a school for deaf children and helped to spread information about safe sex to high school and college freshmen students, just to name a few.\\n\\nHope this helps.\n\nAnswer:",

Is it supposed to prove a point to the public?  If so, it is certainly not working.  Studies have been done and have found that in states that have the death penalty, it has not made a difference in the number of murders.  There is no reasonable argument for it.  If we kill killers, are we going to rape rapists?  It just doesn't make sense.  It costs more money to kill someone by lethal injection than life in prison, it takes an average of 15-18 years from trial to execution.  If anyone can think of a reasonable argument for the death penalty, I want to hear it.\nAnswer: Just what you do with them ? I agree , a killing is a killing and I think it started with an eye for a eye or revenge . \\nAs it says in the Bible , \" Vengeance is mine , \" saith the Lord and I don't seem to remember him saying , that it's alright to kill someone that hurts you . \\nAm I right or wrong , just asking ?

This makes hurricanes more likely to form because they need ocean temperatures above 80 degrees fahrenheit to form.  Since hurricanes often create tornados, they are also more likely to form.  Global warming's level of severity depends on exactly where you're talking about.  You'd have to specify to get a more definite answer.\n\nAnswer:",

There's all kinds of reasons for this, but I will give you only a couple. I'm writing to you about this with over 33 years of experience and many failed attempts of \"Boxing at home\"\\n\\n   There's the little mistakes that you pick up while you're training at home, dropping your hand as you throw your jab, not shooting your jab straight out, not pivoting on your foot properly when throwing the left hook, stepping straight back with your head up in the air, cat-pawing when you start to get tired. These are the most common of mistakes that everyone starting out training at home does, maybe not all of them but definitely some of them.\\n\\n  Then there's the fact that you're not around the gym atmosphere\\nthe smell of a boxing gym. The subconscious telling you to push yourself harder than the guy hitting the bag next to you. The fact that your being watched by guys/girls who know what they're doing and you want to show that you belong. The fact that the noises that come from a gym give you a rush unlike anything you've ever experienced.\\n\\n   The money you spend on a \"Home Gym\" will be a complete waste, how many times have you bought something you had to have and six months later you thought what a waste? Spend your money on a Gym membership or Gym dues, stay away from Health Clubs like Ballys, Golds Gym, World Gym and countless others who know absolutely nothing about boxing except Rocky's coming out on Christmas.\\n\\n  I understand your position completely, to just stay in shape get yourself a freestanding bag, it's a great way to stay in shape. It's next to impossible to get into the shape you have to be in to actually compete at home, for all the above mentioned reasons and then some.\\n\\n  Good luck.\n\nAnswer:",

The distortion is due to gravitational interaction with its larger and more massive neighbor M81. \\n\\nAnother, very similar example is at least mentioned in Messier's catalog, though it did not get a number on its own: NGC 5195, the companion of the Whirlpool galaxy M51, which had been discovered by Pierre M\u00e9chain. The only further irregular galaxies known to 1782 are the Large and the Small Magellanic Cloud; these are probably miniature disk galaxies in mutual gravitational interaction, and in interaction with our Milky Way.\n\nAnswer:",

I know if it was me, I would just want you to put some thought into it-maybe surprise show up with a single rose, or a night when you surprise her with a movie you rented for her, and then just ask her after she responds to your arrival. Just tell her,\" we've been spending so much time together, and I really enjoy your company, and I want to only enjoy your company-I think we should be official\". Something of this nature.\\nThis is so so cute, good luck, I'm sure she'll accept, and make sure to keep up this attitude of wanting to \"wow\" her during your relationship, b/c that will mean a lot to her.

Who pays taxes. Who puts their earnings back into the economy. Who obeys our laws (especially the laws governing getting into this country). So what rights, exactly, are they talking about?\\n\\nIllegal immigrants' comments welcome---go ahead and bash me. I can dish it and I can take it.\nAnswer: I agree with some, but not all of your thoughts...\\n\\n1) when they come here and work, they are paying taxes - it gets taken out of their paychecks. So does Social Security. \\n2) when they go to the store here, they pay taxes, just like you and I. Same thing at the gas pumps, liquor stores, mall, etc. Its not like they come here, work and take the money to Mexico to go grocery shopping. So, they are contributing to the economy - more so than rich folks in America that hide all their money so they DONT have to pay taxes. \\n3) they are humans...they have HUMAN RIGHTS. \\n\\nLast study I read said that Illegals contriubute $90 BILLION dollars to Social Security a year, and only receive $5 BILLION in outside aide. That leaves $85 BILLION to the rest of us. Im also willing to bet that there are more African Americans in our prison system than illegal immigrants - so they are obviously following our laws, despite having \"jumped a border.\" At least they arent killing each other over gang territory or robbing their own people or getting over on charities like wwhats been going on with all the Katrina aide...\\n\\nNow that I think about it, I dont agree at all with you!\n\nAnswer:",

It took many years of improvements in agricultural technology before that could happen. \\n\\nThe most useful thing to the serfs was the invention of metal plows. Before that they used a wooden scratch plow. This was designed for tilling soil in the Mediterranean region but was horrible for tilling the hard soil further north. When they were able to make deeper furrows they were able to plant their crops deeper which protected them from the elements resulting in a greater crop yield. \\n\\nAnother important invention was the creation of a new kind of harness that allowed them to work the land with horses instead of oxen. The old design cut off too much of the horse's windpipe. Naturally, a suffocating horse isn't a good worker. So they used oxen which didn't suffocate but were slow and difficult to work with. With the new harness they could use faster horses and work more of the land.\n\nAnswer:",

The light energy is absorbed by chlorophyl and ultimately transferred to ADP to create ATP in a series of chemical reactions. This process is very indirect. It involves the transfer of an electron to the activated chlorophyll molecules that induces the flow of electrons and H+ across the thylakoid membrane. A chemiosmotic potential is generated by the flow of electrons and H+ providing energy to drive the formation of ATP from ADP.\n\nAnswer:",

Also N.I contributions would cover full dental and optical costs.\nAnswer: Four rules I would add to any welfare system are...\\n\\nIf you are a minor and get pregnant, you are not entitled to any welfare.  Your parents, the father and his parents are responsible.  No exceptions.  If the father refuses to pay, he should be neutered.  No exceptions.\\n\\nIf you are of age and get pregnant and want to go on welfare it will be mandatory that you are spaded.  If the father refuses or can't pay, he should be neutered.  You have acted like an animal and should be treated like one.  People who can't take responsibility for their own actions shouldn't be allowed to procreate.  No exceptions.\\n\\nImmigrants should not get any welfare, social services or tax exemptions at all.  If you want to be a part of a different country then you should contribute to it.  All these church groups that help immigrants come into a country should be forced to support them.  You brought them here, you take financial responsibility for them or they will be shipped back at your expense.  No exceptions.\\n\\nAny elderly or handicapped must show exactly where their assets went before receiving aid of any kind.  I have seen too often where senior citizens have sold their homes and assets, turned the money over to their kids and then went to live on welfare as a way to beat the system.  What is that but letting the tax payer support your parents when you should be doing it?\n\nAnswer:",

There isn't any rash or visable  irritnt\nQuestion: She started having an itch a couple weeks ago on her lower torso and now she itches all over her torso and it seems to be spreading to her upper thighs and arms.\nAnswer: Could be a number of things. Many viruses can cause this type of reaction but most likely its an allergic reaction to something in her environment.  Have your recently purchased a new type of laundry detergent, body wash, or any other product that might come in contact with the skin? if so you could try switching and see if this helps.  Has your wife bought any clothing lately and worn them without washing them first? Many people are sensitive to the dies and other chemicals that might be on new unlaundered garments especially blue jeans.  Look at what you have consumed within the last week and see if their is anything out of the routine that she has eaten.  all in all I would suggest having your family doctor check it out especially if she is pregnant or expecting.\n\nAnswer:",

I need valid information about the public school systems, please. thank you!!!\nAnswer: As a teacher in Pennsylvania, I can tell you that standardized tests are not the best way to measure the quality of any school. Find out graduation rates,  the precentage of graduates who go to college, rates of failing the grade, etc. Teachers are often told to make sure their students do well on these tests, no matter what. Some may choose to, others don't. And many districts teach to the test, meaning they can do well on the test, but they can't do much else. Standardized test results can also be skewed to show the results the districts want you to see. Philadelphia insists that the schools are getting better and it uses standardized test results as one of the proofs. I can tell you that, at best, it isn't any better than it has been in decades and some schools are a lot worse.\n\nAnswer:",

Smug Christians always say that atheists immediately turn to God at the first sign of adversity, but this climber found his atheist beliefs were stronger than ever. In fact, he argues that had he been a believer, he would have accepted events as \"God's will\", and just made his peace and waited either for a miracle rescue, or to die and join God in heaven. Instead, BECAUSE he was an atheist, he lowered himself further into the pitch black crevice. He dragged his broken leg behind him for days, without water, climbing over boulders, etc., and finally made it back to camp. Ironically, the non-atheist at the camp heard him crying for help, thought he was a ghost, and refused to leave the tent to help.  So, my question is, wouldn't a Christian just accepted events, stayed put, prayed and died?\nAnswer: If he's an athiest how would he know what he would do as a believer??\n\nAnswer:",

Or, is the NTRP ineffective and require overhaul?\\n\\njeffspin@comcast.net\nAnswer: Good question. Unfortunately, there are very mixed motives involved in the current classification system. Those who play in leagues or tournaments usually want the lowest rating they can get so they can win. Those who use the rating to let others know how good they are, usually want to be rated higher.\\nIf you are \"accurately\" rated, you will likely be mismatched against those who fudge. This encourages a downward push such that those who previously might have been 5.0s, for example, are now 4.5s.\\nRatings now appear to be based first on your self-assessment, which is frequently falsified, and secondly on your results. I know that players will lose a few matches on purpose just to avoid being moved up a level. This clearly is not in the best interests of the game or in fair competition.\\nSo, I do not believe the system is effective in accurately classifying players.\n\nAnswer:",

It's been 24 hrs. and we haven't heard anything yet. I thought that the first counter-offer wouldn't take so long.\nAnswer: Locally we put a time limit that the seller has to consider the offer, so check your contract and see if there is a time limit for them to repsond.  It is often worded that the offer is open until.....\\n\\nI would call your realtor and ask him/her what time frame is in the contract and if there isn't one specified, what is the local custom.\\n\\nLocal custom is that there is a 24 hour time period for response, unless it's a \"hot\" property, then it can be as little as is written in the contract.\\n\\nOf course all this goes out the window if you are offereing on a lender owned property.  Banks respond in their own time, even if you have an expiration on the offer.\n\nAnswer:",

For example, the mineral magnetite is magnetic, and is found in lodestones. \\n\\nIf you have a magnet, you can stroke a piece of metal (not all metals, but some) and magnetize it; that is, turn it into a magnet. You line up the magnetic domains when you stroke it so it has a net magnetic field. If you put a radio reciever nearby tuned to the right frequency, you can hear the domains flip as you do this; this is called the Barkhausen effect. \\n\\nThere are also electromagnets. Passing an electric current through a coiled wire wrapped around the right kind of metal (called a shunt) produces a magnet. This is the kind of magnet one finds in MRI machines.\n\nAnswer:",

As the water evaporates it releases this heat into the air which must be cooler than your body for this process to work. This is why sweating helps cool the body.

Do you like Jack or Mich bette? Do you support the Jack and Sam relationship?\nAnswer: I love the series it's one of my favorites (besides Farscape and Andromeda), I think that between the great plots and the fantastic character development, it really has a lot going for it. I mean how many other shows last ten years- not many (not to mention it also inspired Atlantis which has become quite successful). \\n\\nWhen it comes to O'Neill and Mitchell, it's really hard to decide who I like better; and I think it's unfair to judge Mitchell this early on considering RDA had eight years of playing O'Neill but Ben Browder has only been there for one. However, both of their performances have been wonderful, you'd be hard pressed to find a better leader of SG-1 than one of them. They both bring (or in O'Neill's case, have brought) a great dynamic to the show, and it really wouldn't be the same without them.\\n\\nAs for the whole Jack/Sam relationship, I really have nothing against it, but I'm not in favor of it either. In my opinion, a little bit of romance on the show is okay, but if they had ever gotten together, I think it really might have made things very different.\n\nAnswer:",

When you go up hold yourself in the half way up position then go all the way up then hold in the halfway down position then all the way down.  Give yourself time to feel the burn when holding in the halfway positions.\\nDo about 20 to 30 minutes of this everyday.  Also do not rest in the down position.

From the light that we can see, ie.. blue, green, red, yellow...etc, the the higher frequency colors are absorbed more by the atmosphere than the lower frequency(actually they're scattered, they still make it to us but indirectly whereas the yellowish color of the sun is more direct).  So blue, green, and violet(violet having the shortest wavelength) are absorbed by the atmosphere, while red, yellow and orange are allowed through.   The color of blue that we perceive the sky varies from day to day based on the content of gases present and the frequency that they vibrate.  It works the same way as light passing through a blue balloon, except in this case the balloon is our atmosphere.\n\nAnswer:",

But every now and then, the utter regularity will collapse and your period will start early or late, or you'll spot, or something else will go amuck.  I suspect this is your body trying to reassert itself against the hormones you are putting in it.\\n\\nIf you're sick, or you have been sick, that can change the absorption of the pill and cause your symptoms... I have particularly seen this with women with yeast infections taking Diflucan or the equivalent. It doesn't mean anything serious is wrong with you... it could just be one of those irritating things.\\n\\nIf you've been having sex, and you don't get your period in a few days, take a pregnancy test.  If, next month, this happens again, consult your doctor.\n\nAnswer:",

(It's appraised at $19,500) Now, they are saying it is worth over $92,000.  Three real estate agents have in the last month as considerably less than $20,000.  They say they have an offer on the property of $40,000 and that takes precedence and now propose to take the property and sell it to whoever has offered the money for the property to pay her debts.  This little piece of property is all she has left.  What can we do?\nAnswer: Frivolous bankruptcy means that you are filing for bankruptcy but actually have the means to pay your bills.\n\nAnswer:",

A typical person can handle about 5 g (50 m/s\u00b2) before this occurs, but through the combination of special g-suits and efforts to strain muscles \u2014both of which act to force blood back into the brain\u2014 modern pilots can typically handle 9 g (90 m/s\u00b2) sustained (for a period of time) or more. Resistance to \"negative\" or upward gees which drive blood to the head, is much less. This limit is typically in the -2 to -3 g (-20 to -30 m/s\u00b2) range. The vision goes red and is also referred to as a \"red-out\". This is probably due to capillaries in the eyes bursting under the increased blood pressure. Humans can survive about 20 to 40 g instantaneously (for a very short period of time). Any exposure to around 100 g or more, even if momentary, is likely to be lethal.\n\nAnswer:",

If you're a LW in the NHL and you have a full cage, players (and people) are gonna laugh at you.\\n\\n2. The aquarium tends to fog up, and the bird cage can hamper your vision.\\n\\nThey require a visor in international and Olympic play.

What is this? If you have this , what have you done?\nAnswer: I am very sorry to hear you have endometriois. I was diagnosed with it when I was 16. I am now 24 and let me tell you, its not the most fun thing to deal with. Periods for me are very painful every month, I have pelvic pain also associtated with this now. The other people who answered were right, there is no cure, and you do have a timeline of if and when you can get pregnant. At 24 my timeline has passed, and I will never be able to bear my own children. Every case of endometriosis is different. You really shouldn't stress out over it. When you see your Dr. make sure to ask him/her ALL the questions you have. When I was first diagnosed they put me on birth control, pain pills, hormomones and testerone. But like I said it effects everyone differently. I wish you the best of luck and hope you get to feeling better soon. I sincerely feel for you.\n\nAnswer:",

The examination was still horrid & I felt really tearful before and after so if was great I had someone there to hold my hand. I was just wondering if anyone else preferes to have someone accompany them to the exam, even if it's in the same room but behind the curtain?\nAnswer: I find a PAP smear to be terribly uncomfortable as well. I would suggest trying another doctor, as some doctors are rougher than others. And I have tried female docs, but believe it or not, some of them were the roughest. I work in the medical field, and I have patients who bring friends with them even for things as simple as an ultrasound of their arm. If you are uncomfortable and need support, by all means bring a friend or your husband.

These are often part of the large software programs they use to run the dealership. Car manufacturers also try to encourage loyalty by sending out coupons for service specials at local dealerships, for example. The more they can get you at the dealership, the more it will reinforce their name.

It is a pheromonious beauty that engages the senses and titilates the imagination. \\n\\nIt could be from the look of her lips to the curve of her hips to the sound of her voice to the maturity of her soul. Not all are the same, but the one constant is that it is something small and unnoticeable that gets your attention. \\n\\nIt is the whole of her that says...\\n\\nI am beautiful.\\n\\nSexy in and of itself is whatever increases the heartbeat when it is around.\\n\\nLike a woman with a voice that you love, and you get her to talk about anything just so that you can hear it.\\n\\nLike a woman whose lips are like Angelina Jolie's that says, KISS ME!\\n\\nLike a woman in an oversized shirt, blue jeans, and barefoot.\\n\\nLike a woman whose hair is not neat but looks like Saturday morning when she just pins it up in a bun and wisps of hair flows over her forehead.\\n\\nLike a woman who just rests in your arms after a long day and falls asleep while watching the sunset...\n\nAnswer:",

These systems are safer since they use a lower speed.\\n\\n2)  For more speed, such as to shoot a tennisball across a tennis court, a common method is to use rotating wheels.  As seen from above, position one treaded wheel so that it rotates clockwise on a vertical axis.  Position another treaded wheel so that it rotates counter-clockwise on another vertical axis.  The wheel edges should be spaced just less than a tennisball's width away from each other.\\nDesign a safe delivery system to channel the ball between the rotating wheels, and it will shoot out.  The faster the wheels are spinning, the faster the ball shoots out. (This method can also be done with only one wheel, using a solid launch ramp in place of the second wheel.)\n\nAnswer:",

It's gotten worse lately and the other day my allergies went crazy and I started crying because my eyes were itching so bad.  My throat gets irritated and my sinuses get completely stuffed up.  I'm wondering what to do.  It's a fairly small classroom for a college so anywhere I sit I will probably smell it.  Plus, I don't want to move because I like the partner I have now when we do projects.  So I\"m just wondering, what do I do?  If he sits near me do I get up and go to the other side of the room?  Have you ever dealt with this problem.  Please help!  I can't sit through an hour of interactive class and be miserable!\nAnswer: ask if you can change classes if its offered at a different time or otherwise you will have to talk to the teacher and have her move him somewhere away from you,  maybe sit by an open window.  Or you could talk to him personaly and explain your allergy to him, and maybe he will be cool about it and skip the cig. before that class.\n\nAnswer:",

The infection scars the liver and can, in extreme circumstances be fatal but the usual prognosis is general fatigue (flu like symptoms).  There are a number of strains of Hepatitis, some have no long term affects and can be easily treated, others are more serious but can be managed/cured quite easily.  The 1 strain of Hepatitis that can not presently be cured is Hepatitis C - this may lead to serious problems some 15-20 years after contracting it and often goes undiagnosed until such time as one starts to become quite ill.  If you are concerned you may have contracted a type of Hepatitis, ask your doctor for a screening and remember, most forms are easily treated.  Best of luck.\n\nAnswer:",

Think about a room filled with people.  If the people move around quickly (as molecules in heated air), then the people will spread out more and make more room between eachother (which would be lower density).  Since the hot air is less dense, and more dense objects are \"more affected\" by gravity, then the warm air is \"lighter\".\n\nAnswer:",

They managed to find out the truth coz they wanted to kno the truth and any one who finds out the real truth about islam will never b a non-Muslim any more.\\n\\nbefore any comments check these videos out, if u dont have the player or somin, download it, do what ever and watch these  videos.\\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUufwp0F8Rw \\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMGyCr0LPh0\\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36Glj_FAGcw\\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_k62TYdR10g&NR\\n\\nand we got a site where u c some miracles of ALLAH\\nhttp://www.geocities.com/islamicmiracles/index.htm\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nplz plz check it out and do comment on them\\nALLAH U AKBER(GOD IS GREAT)\nAnswer: 1. I am a Christian and do not believe that Islam is equal to terrorism. \\n\\n2.  I am a Christian who aloso does not believe that Islam is the religon from God. In fact I do not believe in Religon. Religon blinds and enslaves people. Truth awakens people and sets them free.  I've studied Islam, and this is just my personal view, but it didn't speak to me.   Much of it seems like a mixture between Judaism and Christianity.  I just think Christianity is more true, if not the truth.  \\n\\nAs for 1000s of people converting to Islam everyday, well 1000s of people convert to Christianity everyday, but you and I know that there is a diffrence between one who calls themselves a Muslim and One who truly is a Muslim. Just like there is a diffrence betweeen one Who calls himself a Christian and one who is truly a Christian.  \\n\\nG-flux\\nGod bless\n\nAnswer:",

This aromatic resin oozed down the sides of trees, as well as filling internal fissures, trapping debris, such as seeds, leaves, feathers and insects. As geologic time progressed the forests were buried and the resin hardened into a soft, warm, golden gem, known as amber. Amber is the fossilized resin of ancient trees which forms through a natural polymerization of the original organic compounds. Most of the world's amber is in the range of 30-90 million years old.\n\nAnswer:",

But theoretically if both of you have open wounds in your mouth then there is a distant chance (very very small %) of spreading the HIV infection. Mode of transmission of HIV is 1) Through sexual contact with HIV infected person.  2) From infected mother to fetus (baby in the uterus). 3) By receiving HIV infected blood or blood product transfusion - this route is now very rare because of modern laboratory tests to detect HIV in blood, before giving transfusion. 4) By sharing needles (drug addicts)and or accidental contaminated needle stick injury in a hospital.\\n---- One more point---  HIV can not be transmitted through the bite of mosquitos---- We are lucky right!!??\n\nAnswer:",

He started having all kinds of problems even some of the ones above. He still has a bad backache even though he is sleeping well now (the last 6 mos).\\nSome of the damage can stick around a long time. The body must get sleep to repair cells and for rest and for your brain to rest too.\\n\\nIt is dangerous to not get sleep as you can fall asleep anywhere at anytime. The body just shuts down.

He makes it hard to let go, so I need to know what I should do when he trys to reach me? I will be ok if he doesnt.

I just need to know what to say to make him understand. Please help me.

Not only would we need to calculate the speed of the Solar System; but the speed of the Milky Way Galaxy; the speed of the Universe; and in which direction.\\n\\nWhy would we need to know this? We would need to be able to travel to the actual physical position in which the Earth would be located at the time in which we were desiring to be present.\\n\\nIt is my opinion that if it were not for the fact that we are traveling at such and such a speed that \"Time\" itself would not be possible in the first place.\\n\\nThe fact that physical matter is never in the same location;;;EVER;;; is what I believe makes the existance of matter a possibility.\\n\\nImagine that if the Earth were a hundred miles away from its current location in just one small second of time. To travel back one second in time you would have to travel that one hundred miles of distance.\\n\\nWould the Earth be there if you could travel that distance? Some scientists want to believe that \"worm holes\" can link up huge distances in space by folding or warping space, distance, and time. \\n\\nI personally believe that God has the power to time travel; or how else could he know the future in order to prophesy; and I do believe he has proven the ability to prophesy. Yet, did he time travel, or did he make things happen according to his prophecy?\\n\\nOk; if God exists in the future; or at the end of time (the furthest point in which time has yet reached since the beginning of all time) and has the ability to travel back into various points of the timeline; he then has the ability to travel forward and backward in order to see how well things are going according to his own actions.\\n\\nSo then, Jesus would have seen everything before it ever happened. I also take into account that God must have the ability to be larger than the Universe and smaller than the smallest forms of energy and matter if he were truly capable of producing and controlling them.\\n\\nYet affording us free will is what allows us to be who we are.\\n(see references below)\\n\\nIs it possible that matter is frozen in time at every location along the path of which it travels? In other words; Is our history preserved as if it were a tape or recording throughout all of its existence? It does not seem possible; but anything is possible with God. Maybe this is where the \"Missing Universe\" energy is located; frozen in time. If this were true than I believe it may be possible to time travel. One would have to have the ability to travel amazing distances at amazing speeds.\\n\\nI would have to believe that traveling into the past would be possible under the circumstance that matter becomes frozen in place as it travels and that a person could travel such distances and had much time available for the journey.\\n\\nSo if traveling into the past were possibe; because the past would be there; whereas the future may not be yet, would traveling into the future be possibe?\\n\\nAfter traveling backward, surely we could then travel back to the future from where we just came from. This theory would conclude that we exist in the \"real\" present and the future really has not happened yet.\\n\\nSo traveling into the future could only happen if we first traveled back into the past, and then went back to the future.; where we came from.\\n\\nSo lets say someone else traveled back from the future (which has not happened yet to us; because at which point do we cease to be the \"real\" point in which time has already existed?) into our present time. We would have to consider that if God really does prophecy by time traveling, then we do not currently live in the \"real stream of time\"; but time and history has already taken its course and has already been fulfilled.\\n\\nIn other words; we do not live in the real present; but\n\nAnswer:",

You do need to be strong in math and then there are a series of tests you need to take and pass in order to be considered a professional actuary (though a lot of companies will hire you after you've taken one or two and help you with the rest).\n\nAnswer:",

I have worked in the hotel/ hospitality industry for 2 years now and I recently applied for an assistant front office manager position at a hotel in the area. I've had one one-the-phone interview with the Human Resourses Director, another with the HR Director and the Front Office Manager, and one with the General Manager. I got an e-mail from the HR Director today for the final step in the interviewing process and its an online assessment test. I took the first part which was a simple agree, strongly agree, disagree, and strongly disagree test. The second part I clicked on said I only get 6 minutes to completel....so right there I am already under pressure. The next part had NOTHING to do with hotel hospitality....it was a MATH TEST! Now keep in mind...Math, in highschool, for me, was HORRIBLE. I am the most horrible in Math! I was positive they were going to hire me but after this math test I think I am doomed. Am I over-reacting? Nice answers only please!\nAnswer: I hope you take this as a nice answer, to tell you the truth I don't know. It really depends on the job you will be doing. They give Math test when the job requires math to be done on the job. As an assistant front office manager, you may need to be able to add, subtract etc. While this does not sound like hotel hospitality, it is if say you need to take 13% off someones bill of $367.30. Yes you can use a calculator if you have one handy, but what if you don't, do you know by just looking at it you are to take off approximately $40.00? I hope you get the job, but I have a bad feeling if you really did bad on the math test, you may not get it.\n\nAnswer:",

I find this interesting.\nAnswer: That's because in general men (myself included) tend to be more visual and look for an instant attraction.  A woman is more likely to take the time to make an assessment of a man's character, his sense of humor and wit, whether he's interesting etc.  The first cut, if you will, for a man is physical attractiveness.  While for women, that criteria may be down the line a little and she is more likely to give a guy a chance who fits all her other criteria but may not be the best looking guy.\n\nAnswer:",

Try switching her to a sippy cup, and I think that you will find that the fewer bottles she has, the more she will be willing to eat.  Being on the bottle at her age can damage her teeth.  Just be positive with her, \"I think you're ready to be a big girl now, aren't you?  But, big girls don't drink from bottles.  They drink from cups.\"  And show her other ways to be a big girl, like maybe teaching her to write her name, reading, having her own chores, etc.  Make it something fun for her.  (BTW, I know chores don't sound like fun, but toddlers like helping, especially if the job isn't to difficult for them.)\n\nAnswer:",

Everything seemed fine, except more and more I'm becoming less intrerested in sex. My fiance had been in Boot camp and training for the first 6 months of the year, so I didn't really notice a drastic decline of sexual drive. It's put a litle bit of strain on my relationship of 4 years, as we've always had a very nice sex life. I feel bad because my fiance thinks he's doing something wrong(which he's not), but intercourse is not appealing to me lately. Period. I'm considering going off the pill for a while, but I don't want to risk pregnancy(even with using condoms) because I heard you were even more likely to get pregnant soon after coming off it. Has anyone else experienced this side effect? Or do you at least have any suggestions to help me get into the mood?\nAnswer: That's actually a great question, and yes, I've been on the pill for about 3 years now, and at first I did have that problem. I was on ortho tricyclin, which I blame it on. Because it gradually decreases in strength each week, tricyclin pills tend to have adverse side effects n some people. Once I switched to Yasmin, I think it's called a monocyclin, it all got better. That specific pill gives you the same amount of hormone every day of the month. I've been less moody, and more interested, if you know what I mean. The bad part is that Yasmin does not yet have a generic brand so it is a bit more expensive, but I'd totally recomend it. My doctor switched around my prescription right when I said I was feeling moody. \\n\\nBut then again, I may be totally off.

They called me back and said they might be interested in hiring me if I wanted to come in for an interview.  The interview was actually a huge group screening process, so to speak, where we learned things about the company and got the opportunity to (theoretically) ask questions.  It was supposedly a type of sales company and I would have been a saleswoman.  I was promised to make a lot of money if I only worked really hard, and they gave us samples of some of the products they offered (health, fitness, weight loss and beauty products) and I, being gullible as I was, said I'd love to work for them (I was desperate for a job).  The woman I talked to told me there was an orientation in Grand Rapids and it would cost $25 to go, so I paid up and went.  Then I signed up for $250 worth of starter products, with a payment plan to pay them back if I couldn't sell them all.  I quickly discovered that it was a pyramid scheme, and that they didn't make money by selling products so much as recruiting other people and making money off of them, precisely as the woman was doing with me.  My mom chewed me out for it and made me give everything back, with the exception of a bottle I had already opened to give samples (they suggested that I use the starter set of products to offer samples and sell from there), which was sixty bucks.  So I had to pay that.  All said and done, I was out a lot of time and money and had nothing to show for it but a bottle of pills.  Yeah, I felt stupid...\n\nAnswer:",

Its not that I am a loner, infact I had a girlfriend in my college days and we did a lot of things together including sex but honestly speaking I had no genuine attraction towards her and it was all peer pressure. Infact apart from her I have never had a relationship with anyone. I stongly feel the need for someone to make my life complete but again I am too freaked out whenever I even get close to a girl I find attractive. Its come to a point where I am not able to talk to even my best friend's wife, though I have no designs on her. In a way I am desperate but I am not able to come outside this inhibition. Help me get outside it, any advice? (By the way I live in India and it is perfectly acceptable to remain single untill marriage)\nAnswer: Hmmmm... I think that you might want to seek professional help with this problem.  See the thing is confidence isn't something that you can teach.  A professional might be able to help you unwrap why you are not confident to begin with, but I am not sure anybody is going to have a magic pill for you.  Well here goes something.  Dude, the key to sexual prosperity, is rejection.  I know that sounds dumb but listen, every time your faced with an attractive woman, you get tense and lock up why? because you're afraid of being rejected and feeling like a loser right?  Well just decide not to feel that way (easier said than done but it doesn't have to be hard).  Try this exercise, go to a bar, and identify 5 women that you are attracted to, and go and introduce yourself, i promise at least 1 will want to at least TALK to you, and then when you feel a bit more confident with talking you can start romancing.  See love, and dating and courtship is a numbers game, and every time you hear a no that is one less you have to hear till you INEVITABLY get a yes.  There are like a billion people in India right? 500,000,000 women, trust me at least 100,000 will want to talk to you or go out on a date with you.  So never take anything a woman says personally, and welcome rejection, as one less hurdle to your inevitable GUARANTEED success, and you may find that you can talk to women after-all.  Good luck bro, and I hope this helps.  I know it sounds crazy but trust me it works.\n\nAnswer:",

Not sure what you mean by when they are expected to be sold but debt trades in the secondary market everyday. Most of it is over the counter so you won't see it in the paper.

It could be that you don't have enough ram to do this smoothly. Especially if you have other programs running at the same time.

There's several pitchers of equal ability you can get for 6 or 7 million a year.  Weaver shouldn't be kept. When he's on he's good,  but he's too inconsistent and at this point in his career, if he hasn't reached the expectations placed upon him when he first came up he's never going to reach them. Fans might be sentimental towards Soup and Weaver because of their postseason performances, but those few games alone don't justify making a bad long-term decision.\\n\\nAs much as I cringe saying this (based on numerous 2006 nightmares he cause me to have), I would keep Marquis. He has great stuff, and could potentially be a very good number 2 starter. Hopefully last seasons' implosion was just a fluke and he'll get his act together next season. He's an all around great athlete, and has the potential to be a 16 to 18 game winner. I hang on to him and hope that he can get his act together, even if that means shipping him down to Memphis (Cards AAA affiliate for all the non-Cards fans reading this) for a few months.\n\nAnswer:",

He had a will. My sister is refusing to give me a copy of the will. I have called to see if she has filed the will through Probate Court, and she has not done so. What legal measures would I have to get a copy of the will if she has no intentions of filing the will anytime soon? Family has told me that no executor was appointed but my sister has the only copy of the will and is claiming that she will be the executor, but seems to not have any intentions of filing the will anytime soon. When I requested a copy of the will from her, she told me that I \"wasn't getting anything\" and I have no idea if this was my dad's wishes. But, if I wasn't getting anything why would she refuse me a copy of the will? But if for some reason my dad didn't mention that he wanted me to specifically have anything or for her to have anything, does this mean his assets will be equally split in Probate Court.\nAnswer: You need to find a good attorney, specializing in probate.\\nShe may be breaking the law by not bringing the will into view by your father's heirs.  That is, you or anyone else who is direct family.\\n\\nAmazing how people are.  In your  father's death, you OWN   \"blood\" would treat you like that.  \\n\\nOf course I don't know your history with you sister, but in the case of your father passing, you would think differences would be cast aside for a time.\\n\\nBut, I am learning people are mean, selfish, and love to see others in pain.  And when it comes to money, they are ruthless.  Even those 'civilized ones' of affluent status. \\n\\nJust look around you and you can count on one finger the people who are happy, and content.\n\nAnswer:",

I use NAC which is a strong anti-oxidant and anti-viral. I haven't been sick in a year!! The way it works is it is a precursor to glutathione. Glutathione is the natural hormone that your body creates to keep your immune system up. By taking the precursor you encourage your body to take care of itself rather than becoming dependent on a pill.\\nIt is used for hep C patients too who have no immune support of their own. Great stuff! It is available at any Wild Oats or health food store.\\nI also recommend probiotics. In a healthy body there is a consistent level of healthy flora that the body maintains. If that flora is lost or flushed out it makes room for destructive viruses and bacteria. By taking probiotics you encourage the growth of healthy flora and push out the bad bacteria. There is no longer room for it to grow and flourish in order to make you sick. Primal defense probiotics are used to help victims of crohns disease live a more comfortable life.\\nI am rarely sick enough to have to take anything else when I am keeping a regular schedule with my probiotics and NAC. You will find that you poop more as your body flushes itself and kicks up your metabolism. \\n\\nHappy Healing!!\n\nAnswer:",

After yrs of eating it i grew tired of it and gave it up months ago. And have been mostly eating different varieties of pasta, fruits, veggies and nuts. Is this healthy and effective in losing weight?\nAnswer: You need to get the proper proteins.  You should add different legumes to you diet as well so you get the proper combinations of amino acids.  \\n\\nProtein is one of the MOST IMPORTANT building blocks to our nutritional status that we can consume and I don't think you are getting enough by just eating nuts.  \\n\\nGet a good book on veg nutrition and start adding more good protein to your diet.  Not SOY, because soy leaches out the vitamins in your body.\\n\\nGood luck with that, and whenever you want to eat a good steak - we'll  leave the light on for you!\n\nAnswer:",

But do something everyday, and you can see the results later.\\n\\nSome ideas:\\n\\n1. Create the best content you can. Your content is your best advertisement - if visitors love your content, then they will go back and spread the word to others.\\n\\n2. Make it easy for users to recommend your site. Viral marketing is very important -- and easy to tap on the Web. But give your users the tools. Get a Recommend this Site script from websites such as cgiscripts.com and similar directories of scripts. Some even go as far as giving incentives to those who recommend the site to their friends. \\n\\n3. Rank well in the search engines (organic search results, not the pay per click). SEs can be a big source of traffic. The key is to create the best content in your niche. If you have good content, other websites will gladly link to you and offer your site as a resource to their audience. Check the on-page factors and be sure to get linked from authority sites in your topic area.\\n\\n4. Send out press releases. While outfits charge as much as $650 per release, there are free press release submission places on the Web. Press releases allow you to (a) attract media attention; (b) get more back links to your website without sending each website an email request; and (c) get more visibility especially if your press release gets in Google News or Yahoo News.\\n\\n5. Submit articles. Write articles and submit them to websites accepting author submissions. You get exposure for your business; establishes you as an authority in your field, and allows you to get backlinks for your website. Be sure to have About the Author blurb at the end of the article with your website URL\n\nAnswer:",

He/she THINKS it's a question of greater importance and perhaps imbues the question with a sense of urgency.\\n\\nI would tell the asker to calm down, take a deep breath, and ask the question again - with only ONE question mark this time.\n\nAnswer:",

How do radio stations work? I do know that comercials are a source of income for them. But what about the songs? Do radio stations purchase the songs? Purchase the right to play them over and over, or payment every time the song is played? Or could it be that radio stations dont even pay for the songs? Do they buy the CD's? I'm just curious... Thanks in advance :0)\nAnswer: As far as stations buying their music.. If the station is in a higher ranking market the record labels will provide the music for free.  They are happy to get the exposure. Every station that plays music is required to pay a flat licensing fee to ASCAP/BMI (they are the companies that pay the artists \"royalties\" each time their song airs.)  Some smaller stations sometimes need to actually go out and purchase their music, stations can also subscribe to music services that will provide a basic music library, along with weekly updates.  They will not actually charge the stations for this service, they will do a \"barter\" service with the stations to place comercials on the stations in leu of chash payments.  I hope I am not confusing you more!  As far as CD's go, a vast number of stations don't even use them anymore.  A lot of stations use a \"hard drive\" music delevery doing away with all of the clutter of cd's.  Most stations are computer operated these days, a lot of the stations dont even have \"live talent\" in the studio anymore.  They accomplish this by a process of \"Voicetracking\".  The DJ does not even have to be in the same city as the station he or she is on.  Talent can e-deliver their voice-tracks to basically anywhere Via a computer.  I hope this helps you out a bit.... If it leaves you with more questions... feel free to e-mail me.  I would be happy to help out.\n\nAnswer:",

If there was low friction, the rope would slide out, or you would have to hold it very very tightly, and this would increase the effort.\\n\\nAs between the pulley and the rope, there is very little friction and exactly this reduces the effort. If the friction was high (e.g. if the pulley was stuck), the required effort would have been higher.\\n\\nIf you're interested in how the wheel reduces friction, it is simple. Say you need to pull something by many meters. If there was no wheel, you would have many meters of high friction movement. If you have a wheel with a circumference of 1m, and its axis has a circumference of 1cm, then for each rotation of the wheel (1m) only the axis slides against the wheel by 1cm. The slide distance is 100 times lower. That's even not accounting for sleeve bearings (reducing friction of the axis). Or, even better, ball bearings.\n\nAnswer:",

I'm invited to xmas day, they're filling a stocking for me and everything.  What should i get them?  Moderate pricing, but not cheap.\nAnswer: Go with the gift card to a nice restaurant.  That way you know they both will enjoy the gift.  Put it in a nice card and write a few nice words to them (the card and words are extra credit with your girl).  For wine, you must know if they drink, if it is even appropriate, and what they prefer.  An ex of mine's father was a recovering alcoholic and I didn't find out that after the fact, so I'm glad I didn't get them wine.  A restaurant is pretty easy and you can pick any amount $25, $50, $100 depending on your income and length you've been dating their daughter.\n\nAnswer:",

This role of a symbologist would require a lot of homework. I wonder whether the movie is going to be as impressive as the book. Dan Brown is marvellous. Some feel that Russel Crowe would have been a better choice for the role.\nAnswer: I don't think Tom Hanks would make a good Langdon. I'm 13 and I read \"Angels & Demons\" by Dan Brown (also about Langdon) and personally considered that maybe Russel Crowe, Sean Connery, Dustin Hoffman (since he studied the role for \"Rain Man\" so well). I think Tom is too young to play Langdon, correct me if I'm wrong. I also think that the movie will be a little bit worse than the book (which i have not read yet but my whole family has told me it was amazing), but still will be one of the best pictures of the year considering the hype. i have to agree that he was good in Terminal.\n\nAnswer:",

A co-worker had some questions about ....?\nQuestion: He wanted to know where dinosaurs fit in in the Bible and also \"IF\" every thing that happens is in Gods plan and Gods Will, how does praying help.  I would like to have an answer for him.  Thanks\nAnswer: The dinosaurs fit right in. What I don't get is how more people don't see how it fits but let me give you my humble opinion. This is not doctrine, this is one man's opinion. This is what I believe. On things of God we have a couple a sacred texts or scripture, in the oldest book about God written by the hands of prophets on stone, papyrii and what not we have accounts of the creation, in Genesis the first of even the pentetauch we are given such as slim or incomplete description that it is possible that 1 billion years could pass by as we read in a matter of one stanza. It has been said that 1 day in God's time is 1000 of our years in our reckoning. So lets take the first 6 days of the creation, or in particuliar the the 5th day after he had made some grass and light and stuff. In Gen 1:20 it say that He said\" Let the waters bring forth abundantly the moving creature that hath life, and fowl that may fly above the earth in the open firmament of heaven. 21. And God created great whales, and every living vreature that moveth, which the waters brought forth abundantly, after their kind, and every winged fowl after his kind: and God saw that it was good. 22 And God blessed them, saying, Be fruitful and Multiply, and fill the waters in the seas, and let fowl multiply in the earth. 32. And the evening and the morning were the fifth day. 24 And God said, let the earth bring forth the living creature after his kind, cattle, and creeping thing, and beast of the earth after his kind; and it was so. \" So that 5th day was very busy and at 1000yr /day reckoning its possible that it took 365,000 years to complete but cant know precisely yet . The beast of the earth that is referred to, also the great whales that are referred to, also refences to unicorns and all manner of beasts now extinct, isn't it possible that although not specifically mentioned that and on the 5th day about the 6th and 1/2 hour God made the T-rex and he blessed them and saw that they were ferocious. No . We only have this small wordage to assemble together the whole of creation. I dont see a problem with 17 billion year universe age and putting it into Gods plan at all. Bless you and have a pleasant tomorrow.\n\nAnswer:",

Most rectal bleeding comes from the colon, rectum, or anus. The color of the blood often depends on the location of the bleeding in the gastrointestinal tract. The closer the bleeding site is to the anus, the blood will be a brighter red. Bleeding from the transverse colon and the right colon tend to be dark red or maroon colored.

Einstien come up with the equation E=mc2? how will it be ralative in dev. of a-bomb/fusion?\nAnswer: The E=mc^2 equations come from Einstein's theory of Special Relativity. Special Relativity concerns the laws of motion and observed properties when objects are travelling very close to the speed of light.\\n\\nSpecial relativity starts with two premises: the speed of light is constant for all observers, and the laws of physics are the same for all observers. However, observed properties are not necessarily the same.\\n\\nSay I flew past the Earth in a space ship travelling 99% the speed of light. To me, the space ship is normal, but the Earth would look squished, rotated, and blue with everyone moving slowly. To you, however, Earth would look normal, but the space ship would be squished, rotated, blue and with everyone moving very slowly. (This gets resolved if the space ship turns around - breaking the symmetry - to come home, and results in the famous Twins \"Paradox.\")\\n\\nIn describing the laws of motion in the context of special relativity Einstein derived that E = mc^2 -- in other words that mass has a \"rest energy.\"\\n\\nIf an electron and an anti-matter electron (known as the positron) bump into each other then their is total energy conversion. The mass of two electrons is converted into energy.\\n\\nIn a fission or fusion bomb the the atomic process (breaking apart a heavy atom, or fusing some light atoms) results in a  much smaller conversion of mass to energy. But still a lot compared with normal explosives.\n\nAnswer:",

You know it. I know it. We all know it. So why don't we have more of it? I'm not sure I understand why it takes so much effort and emotional exchange to take place before having a sexual experience with another human being. What's the big deal. Okay, disease is your concern. So why not put more effort into prevention and finding cures for them? That's solved. So now.. what stops everyone from just having sex for fun. I don't get it. Besides the fact of say family relations.. that would be gross. But strangers should be with out question, perfect game for just going at it with each other. They should set up centers for people to meet and have sex for free with each other. Is it women who stop this from occurring? Is it the attachment and bonding of the emotion love? What is it? Why can't we relieve our tension with sex the same way we would with a nice massage by a stranger? Were the 60's the only time to do this? What happened to the passion?\nAnswer: Well, you put alot of thought into your question.  The 60's ended December 31, 1969.  Unless you've got a time machine, the 60's can't help you.  Most VD could be cured by antbiotics.  AIDS changed all that.  So, yes the 60's (and most of the 70's and some of the 80's and when you think about it the 90's too and then there was last week....) was the only time to do this.  And the last time I checked, massages did not spead disease.\\n\\nAnd you don't sound like someone who's actually HAD a disease or you wouldn't have glossed over it so easily.  You also sound like someone who hasn't had a bad experience with one night stands.  The rejection that occurs from getting attached to someone who wants nothing further to do with you can be devastating.  Add to that the poossiblity that your pick-up could be a killer psycho, and sex with strangers loses some of its appeal.  \\n\\nHey, women want good sex just as much as men, but let's face it, most men are pretty easy to please.  All a woman has to do is show up and men are happy.  Men need a few times to \"get it right\" and so need to offer something more than just sex.  Witty conversation and manners, for example.  If a woman is bolting out of bed after sex, then something's wrong. \\n\\nAnd society encourages promiscuity, so no blame there either.  Even have a song about it.\\n\\nWhy limit yourself to strangers exclusively, though?  I find that most intruiging.  It seems you only find strangers appealing.  You could get much more sex in a monogamous situation, so I wonder why that route wasn't even considered in your question.  No diseases, no brutal murders, and mutual satsfaction.....and passion.  \\n\\nI understand the appeal of the one night stand; the mystery, the unpredictability, the variety.  But in the cold hard light of day, you know they're just not someone you'd like to hang with.  And once again comes the lonliness, the emptiness and the boredom.\\n\\nLet's face it...sex with strangers is common, the status quo...it's love that's rare these days.\n\nAnswer:",

People have this idea that black holes are somehow different because even light cannot escape their gravity. If light cannot escape, nothing else can either, so the black hole will eventually eat all the matter in the universe, right? Well, light can escape from Earth but nothing else can, at least not naturally. Meteors fall to Earth all the time and they have no rocket engines so they can never escape. This is true for any matter that falls to Earth. It can never escape. And the Earth is not eating all the matter in space, so why would you think a black hole would?\n\nAnswer:",

What is strange, is that my heart rate always jumps way up, and I fear I might black-out. I have a clean bill of health, have dived for many years, but have started deep dives just recently.\nAnswer: Both of the answers above are excellent advice. I am a Scuba instructor and like to add to their advice.\\n\\nRecreational diving is normally up to 40 meters. Please review your certification standards and follow them. If you are certified to dive that deep I would consider not doing it. You should be comfortable in the enviroment you dive in.\\n\\nIf you always dive over 40 m and always experience Nitrogen Narcosis, I suggest you dive shallower to lessen the occurace.\\n\\nDiving deep can be fun but it is also very dangerous. You really have to be on top of things. As you know many things can happen other than Narcosis. Remember that diving is a sport and you should enjoy the dive. I have been diving for 30 years and have done deep decompression dives but my favorate depth is about 10 to 35 m.\\n\\nPlease dive safe. Follow the rules and standards. You will dive for years to come.\\n\\nHope this helps.\n\nAnswer:",

Sweating and burning calories reduces weight.  Even though your muscles swell from being overworked, they still have the same weight, if not the same mass.  But afterwards, if you are looking to gain weight, I suggest eating 1.5 times your body weight (just substitute lbs. for g.) of protein shortly after you workout.  Ex: You weigh 150 lbs.  150 x 1.5 = 225lbs.  You need to intake around 225g of protein to successfully gain weight that isn't fat, but the agents that aid in lean muscle mass.\n\nAnswer:",

In those places, certain murderers are condemned to be executed by the state. There are two commonly cited reasons for this. First, public knowledge that a death penalty exists and can be administered is supposed to deter would-be murderers from killing.To say it in the easy, first-person way- If I know that I could get punished with death because I kill someone, that will theoretically make me hesitate to kill a person. Secondly, the people of some states are of the opinion that it is less costly to execute a convicted murderer than to keep that person in prison for life, but the calculations as to the cost-efficiency are not conclusive.  The expressed attitude seems to be that once a person has killed, that person cannot be trusted not to kill again and must be removed from society.\\nIn actual practice, the families of murder victims frequently talk about seeking closure, saying that only the death of the murderer will bring them peace.  That seems like revenge to me. rather than a noble social aim.  It is pretty insensitive of me to even discuss such matters.  Can I declare myself morally superior to others and say that it is wrong to seek revenge? I have no such right.  I can only say that the desire for revenge is the driving force behind much of the violence in the world today. I can only say that if we could get away from the idea of revenge, many violent acts would not happen.\\nI would like to give one last bit of food for thought: when humans act alone and independantly, we do not always take the time to fully justify our morality, but when we act as a society- by making laws- we need to have morals that we can explain.\\nThank you for asking an important question.\n\nAnswer:",

Even the USSR was democratic in the truest sense and meaning of the word, the people could vote, problem was there was only one person they could vote for.\\n\\nOil has NOTHING to do with the war in IRAQ. I won't even get into why but the war would be in Saudi Arabia where the oil reserves are over twice the size of Iraq.\\nWe need to look back in history to see what has happened and the future looks bright for IRAQ. Success in Central America, Liberia, Korea, the new Russia, the slavic regions, and others have formed some type of democracy.\\n\\nThe \"democracy\" that other countries enjoy are definately not the same as ours, but even a Monarchy like Morocco has a democratic government.\\n\\nSuccess in IRAQ will indeed depend on whether democracy becomes the new form of government when America finally does pull out or if there will be political chaos and insergency.\\n\\nTime will only tell.\\n\\nTo correct a couple of the other writers above me...\\n\\nThe United States is NOT a democratic country, it is a Federal Republic. If indeed we were a true democracy Gore would be president not George Bush (Gore won more of the popular vote but less of the electoral vote). So to say the US is the most democratic country in the world is absurd. Correct me if I am wrong but there is no country in the world that is truely democratic.\n\nAnswer:",

S/he will probably just drain it and possibly give you an  antibiotic. Probably nothing to worry about but if its not going away you should have someone check it out. If there is continuing infection under the scar tissue it could go systemic and that would put your vital organs at risk.\n\nAnswer:",

I worked with children at a hospital and sessions were at 8:30 & you were required to be there 30min before to set up, and basically I was getting there between 8 and 8:15 or sometimes closer to 8:20, and I was pretty stupid because I got warned a couple times, however I never thought it would come down to me getting fired. I was however a good employee, I got along with everyone, was good with the kids, knew what I was doing, and all that good stuff. SO I have a job interview coming up and I KNOW that I am very qualified for the position, and it's a position I REALLY want (I didn't even LIKE my last job anyway- blessing in disguise?). And if it wasn't for the attendance problems, I would be confident that I would get the job. My problem is how should I discuss firing in the interview? I read that you should bring it up before they even ask you but also you should not ever say you had attendance problems.\nAnswer: Do not bring it up unless asked.\\n\\nYour former employer BY LAW is only allowed to verify the dates of employment, position and compensation....that is LAW.\\n\\nHowever....some employers will take liberties and attempt to blacken your name.\\n\\nHave a friend call your former employer under the guise of a hiring manager for XYZ company...and have them ask about your employment etc. You will then have a heads up on the type of answer/reference your former boss is handing out to the people calling in.

We were expecting a couple we know to arrive. So I went to the door without changing. I had on some rubber bondage gear and rubber restraints on my arms which were very tight (I am not into this stuff, I just do it for the wife). \\n\\nI was greated by two mormon missionaries, aged about 20, in suits with bibles in hand.\\n\\nNow My wife and I are tolerant. But as born again christians, my wife and I don\u00b4t want to discuss our faith with those from the Church of the Latter Day Saints. We say live and let live, it\u00b4s just that it is not our thing. \\n\\nThose guys just wouldn\u00b4t leave. They asked to come in. The one on the left looked at me funny. In the end I had to shut the door on them. I didn\u00b4t want to but after fifteen minutes, I was losing the circulation in my arms and could not feel my hands. \\n\\nIs it me, or are these mormon missionaries too pushy?\nAnswer: I know what you mean.  Why just the other day I was in the process of making a burnt offering an ox on the alter that I have erected on my front lawn (To get the Lord to rig the next power ball drawing for me, as per the bible, book of Carbonization, 23-10), when I was accosted by a pair of LDS missionaries.  They actually had the audacity to interrupt my opening benediction to ask if I was interested in their religion, and whats more, their caterwauling frightened the ox, who snapped his restraints and bolted, leaving me with a roaring fire, some very sharp knives, and two belligerent missionaries.\\n\\nAs I am sure you can guess, this sort of threw off my rhythm, and basically ruined the sacrifice.  Whats more, they refused to buy me another ox to sacrifice in place of the one that they had frightened off.  \\n\\nI just can't understand it.  I mean, I let them practice their religion in peace, why can they not extend the same courtesy to me?\n\nAnswer:",

He was doing great with normal pens & pencils but he smudges the ink now he has to use an ink pen. The only help I have found on internet is to slant the page but he doesn't want to do this. He is getting very nervous + upset now when he has to write stuff.\\nSuggestions, please ...\nAnswer: Complain.\\nI am appalled that the teacher is forcing your son to change hands.\\nI am concerned that the school maintains a policy of making left-handers use 'ink pens'. There is no justification for this, especially when there are so many alternatives. The school should know that 'ink pens' are designed only for right-handers who can pull the nib across the paper; left-handers try (unsuccessfully) to push it.\\nAsk the school what equipment it has for left-handers who make up about 10% of its pupils. This could be inexpensive things such as left-handed scissors and certainly suitable desks and work-spaces. If they have not, why not?\\n\\nI am left-handed. I taught Science for 25 years and made sure that left-handers had the proper equipment when they were in my teaching lab.\\nDo not let your son's school discriminate against left-handedness.\n\nAnswer:",

Wade is overturned?\nQuestion: Many of us take for granted that bans would then be passed in so-called \"red states\"... But what about historically pro-choice states like California? Or New York? What about your state?  For the 33 years since the historic decision of Roe v. Wade, anti-choice extremists have steadily chipped away at a woman's right to choose. But now, two anti-choice Justices have been appointed to the Supreme Court. South Dakota has banned abortion. Louisiana has passed a ban on abortion to go into effect if Roe is overturned. And 12 other states including Ohio, Georgia, and Missouri are considering or have considered similar abortion bans.\\n\\nHow do you feel about this??\nAnswer: It is conceivable that the US Congress might try to pass a law outlawing abortion federally. \\n\\nWomen who have taken their reproductive freedom and personal privacy in this area should be aware that the shrill vocal minority who oppose freedom of choice are doing their best to deprive them of their rights.\\n\\nThe countervailiing position to the argument that a fetus is a human is that, so is the impregnated female. She is not an incubating machine who should have to bear the seed of a rapist or a relative to term just to satisfy the moral smugness of a minority of the populace.\\n\\nolderandwiser is right on.

Thankfully they did lose the control of the House and Senate, but this administration does not support or respect the Constitution.  Lets see where Congressional oversight leads us. \\nCan the hearings, investigations, and subpeonas be very far away?\nAnswer: I would not hold my breath. While it is true that impeachment can be brought with a simple majority in the House which the Democrats have, a 2/3 majority is required to remove a president from office, which they don't have. Republicans will not vote to remove the president. You can count on this, there will be investigations, there will be subpoenas and the end there will be convictions and resignations of lower officials. This is common in these type of affairs as few people can stand up to full Congressional scrutiny in an open ended witch hunt. In the end the investigations will be costly to the American taxpayers and they will be fruitless as far as the intended and desired ends. In short an absolute waste of time and money. You also need to remember that the American public has consistently stated in polls that they are against this type of activity and prefer that the Democrats concentrate on legislation rather than revenge. They should be very careful because this process has the potential to blow up in their faces and cost them dearly in the next election. Mr. Bush cannot stand for office again and Mr. Cheney is not going to run for president.\\n\\nplanksheer: Nixon committed numerous actions designed to obstruct justice. Some of these actions were very public including the firing of the Special Prosecutor and court actions to protect the tapes. In the end Mr. Nixon resigned because Republicans were not going to support. He would have been impeached and he would have been removed from office. The public was also very against Mr. Nixon. To date no evidence has been presented against Mr. Bush that could even come close to a parallel with Nixon. That could change of course during investigations, but the Nixon comparison is weak at best. You would be better served to look at the result of Iran/Contra as this is closer to what might actually happen.\n\nAnswer:",

However, Einstein's theory states that time & perception of time travels relative to your location and your surroundings.\\nThus, if you are moving in an extremely fast velocity, atoms will move much slower (time will move forward slower).\\n\\nThis does NOT mean that you can travel back and forth in time.

My husband had a variety of symptoms, one of which was joint and bone pain. The doctors tested him for rhumatoid, but the results came back negative. It turned out that he had celiac disease. Celiac primarily impacts the digestive system, but advanced cases of the disease get all sorts of autoimmune problems and nutrient deficiencies - one of which is bone and joint pain. Once he quit getting gluten in his diet his pain completely went away. \\n\\nIf he gets a gluten infraction the pain will return. We had that last summer when they had cookouts at work pretty regularly for several weeks in a row. He was careful to select foods that were gluten free, but he kept getting a reaction each time. Since he could find no initial cause, he figured he just had a mild viral infection. By the end of two weeks he had terrible bone and joint pain. We finally discovered that Kingsford charcoal uses gluten as a binding agent in their bricketts. The cookouts were with Kingsford. Kingsford stated that the gluten would burn up completely and couldn't contaminate the food; however, my husband's body showed them to be wrong. He quite eating the grilled foods and his symptoms subsided in just a few days. We have come arcross several other celiacs since then who said they had the same problem with Kingsford.\\n\\nSo, if your doctor hasn't difinitively gotten test results that prove arthritis, do a bit of research to see what conditions have this pain as a symptom.\\n\\nGood luck.\n\nAnswer:",

Or, if you have a plant and the roots are coming out on the bottom of the pot don't you put it in a bigger pot so it can grow?  Its the same with people.  When you hold them too tight they cant breath and feel trapped.  Let her go......She does not need any added pressure or thoughts to keep her from concentrating on her future.   If you are meant to be together you will.  In the meantime do something for yourself as well.  Take a class, workout, or do something you've never done.\n\nAnswer:",

I need to know what others think is going through his mind.?\nQuestion: We have been together for 7 months and we moved in together 2 months ago.  We love each other very much, love is definitely not the issue.  But we agrue all the time.  We are realizing just how very different we are.  I am used to certain things in a relationship and so is he.  We have tried different things several times to make it work but we keep arguing.  I am very inquisitive, and he says it's too much that I ask too many questions about eveything.  But I can't help it.  He lied to me once before (not about another women or anything) something simple that he could have just told me the truth but he didn't and I found out & confronted him & he then he told me the truth.  So I have a real hard time trusting him therefore I question everything.  Lots of things he does that bother me to.  Last night we sat down and I told him I needed to talk to him.    I discussed all the above with him and more and told him perhaps we need to let this go because we are both unhappy and miserable.\nAnswer: I moved in with a guy after 7 months before.. I think it ruined our relationship.  I will never live with a man until I am married now.  It seems crazy to commit to someone that much when you haven't decided if you like them enough to spend everyday (rest of life) with.  Esentially that is what you are doing.. spending the rest of your life together... so it is putting way to much into the relationship. \\n\\nI would suggest moving out and still dating.  You can take a baby step backwards.. He might think it is a good idea too.  It might save your realationship.\\n\\nGood Luck :-)\n\nAnswer:",

Give at least one example. \\nList three items you would be willing to give up in order to gain more structure and order in society. Explain why you chose each item. \\nList three items you would NOT be willing to give up in order to gain more structure and order in society. Explain why you chose each item\\nI have major problems come up with the reasons please help really appreciate\nAnswer: What a brilliant topic!  You coulld write heaps on this.  Three items I'd be prepared to give up? Let's see, I object to too much government interference in my life, but acknowledge the need for a central organising power.  So, perhaps look at what changes have happened, especially since 9/11, to personal freedoms. And what people have seemed to accept, more or less willingly, in order to ensure safety.  It's much easier to list three items you WOULDN\"T give up.  I wouldn't give up right to free speech, for example.  It's too important.\n\nAnswer:",

According to D.C.Browning (p.141), \"[h]e was an artist in grotesque and somewhat obvious humour, his style and cadence suggesting a talker rather than a writer. He has been called 'the Lincoln of American literature'.\"  Twain belongs in the realistic period in American Literature (1865-1900). According to Holman (p.437), \"in the work of Mark Twain, of William Dean Howells, and of Henry James, the greatest contributions of the age were made.\" In addition, from Twain\u00b4s work, one may have a good idea of spoken language at the time.\n\nAnswer:",

For example, solve for x: 5x=15 would be best with an equation because it's easily solvable with one answer. Whereas, A number greater than 9 but less than 12 would be set up as 9<x<12 or 9<x & x<12.  This way, x could be any number between 9 and 12, having infinate solutions. If you have to see how much money you can spend with out going over the allotted amount, would be a real world situation. (IE- You have 20 dollars to spend, and you can't spend negative dollars, so 0<x<20). There you go!\n\nAnswer:",

THEY ARE CHOSEN.\\n\\nThe instinctive 'survival' drive for homo sapiens to 'mate and procreate' predisposes most humans to 'choosing' heterosexuality, as this 'lifestyle' naturally insures the survival of the species. As with most animal species, these instincts are more diminished in some individuals than others, hence the occasional aberrant behavior of a few to 'choose' a homosexual or bisexual path for other reasons; most likely for opportunistic sexual gratification.\n\nAnswer:",

Your pain is due to a mechanical problem and the problem at the patello-femoral joint. This could be because you seem to have neglected your exercise regime and post-operative instructions. It will be a little strenuous but you can build up your muscles around the knee joint and also at the hip so that you can get back to your normal gait. I would advise you to go to a local physiotherapist and learn your exercises.\\n\\n1. Relaxed knee swinging.\\n\\n2. Straight leg raising (later adding weights).\\n\\n3. Isometeric Quadriceps contractions.\\n\\n4. Knee flexion exercises and cycling (speed and time to be increased gradually).\\n\\n5. Progressive resisted exercises as per your progress.\\n\\n6. Hamstring stretching and strengthening.\\n\\n7. Aim at getting full knee extension terminally.\\n\\n8. Strengthening exercises for adductor and internal rotator muscles.\\n\\n9. Gait training.\\n\\n10. Gradually progress to kneeling, assisted squatting, stair climbing and descending and cross legged sitting.\\n\\n11. Aim at reducing your weight too. This is causing additional strain on your knee.\\n\\nYou will have to combine exercises and relaxation techniques in order to get maximum results.\n\nAnswer:",

This object, opens up a connection to a Web server, transmits and receives data, then calls back the javascript on the page which was used to invoke it.\\n\\nWhat this means is that changes on the client side can communicate with the server, then dynamically update the client user interface without having to request a new Web page from the server.\\n\\nWhile this slightly complicates developing Web applications that use AJAX technologies (which, by the way, is just a name given to the various technologies employed to use this methodology), it makes for a very smooth user experience since they are not constantly refreshing Web pages.\\n\\nAJAX applications give an appearance of a 'thick client' application while still being a 'thin client' (i.e. application that runs in a Web browser.)  However, it is important to note that network communication is still going on in the background while the application is being used.\n\nAnswer:",

I have sold over $300K in new jobs since Oct. 2005 normailly he pays us on Saturdays but for the last 3 weeks he has not paid me more than $200.00. I sold $37K in new jobs on 4/13/06 and collected $3200.00 in deposits so he owes me 5% on $3200.00 and my hourly its been 3 weeks he wont pay me. How do I get him to pay what he owes?\nAnswer: call labour relations (That's what it is called in Canada) and explain your situation, they will take care of it for free and make sure that they don't screw someone else around next time.  Also make sure that you have all of the paperwork to back up your side of the story, dates, times worked and anuthing else that might come up.  That way you will have the best case possible.  If you win he could also be fined, so even calling him and making that threat could be efective enough.  If he has done this before and been investigated, it could cause him alot of trouble that he won't want.\n\nAnswer:",

For example, if your parents served in the US military in Mexico, as attaches for example, and you were born in Mexico, but your parents submitted your birth certificate to the US embassy as a report of birth abroad, you would be a dual citizen.\\n\\nThe Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo has 23 articles, but I think what you are referring to just outlines that if the Mexican government granted a deed to a tract of land to a Mexican farmer, for example, that the US government; despite annexing that land, would allow the farmer to remain on that land and honor the deed.\\n\\nIt did not extend the right for all Mexicans to enter the US free from control.\n\nAnswer:",

So, an isolated incedent should not be held against someone. \\nDo I think anyone should drive with a baby on their lap absolutly NOT....the child should have been in a car seat in the back. \\nAs for the head fracture, I don't know anything about that or how it happened so I can't say whether it was due to her neglect or abuse.  Accidents do happen....even when the child has great parents. \\nNone of us are in a postion to sit back and place judgement on anyone. As parents we are responsible for taking care of, providing for and loving our children. Some parents just don't have a good balance between them. A parent can love their child with all of their heart and not be equiped to take care of them or support them properly, a parent can provide for and take care of their child and yet still not show enough or adequate love for their child. \\nParenting is not an easy job....and no matter what you do as a parent there is always someone that will find fault in something you do or in choices you make. \\nAll we can do is be the best parent we can be....even if it means taking parenting classes to help us obtain the skills needed. \\nMore often than not, the families that have child protective services involved are good people trying to do the best they can....flat out abuse just for the sake of abuse is not the norm.\\nPassing judgement and talking bad about it is not going to solve the problem....\\nIf a child is being abused or neglected in any way, someone needs to step in and be sure that the child gets into a home where it will be properly cared for on all levels. The natural parent needs to do things to become a better parent ... prosecution and ridicule by the public is not going to teach the person how to be a better parent.  She needs to work on that and others need to stand up and offer some help and support.... that will help far more than us putting them down.\n\nAnswer:",

Not many worth buying, unless you like being manipulated.\\n\\nAnyone with a million dollars or so can pump and dump these stocks and send their prices soaring, so that you get in, then plunging, so that you lose everything very fast. \\n\\nOr the average guy, you for example, can start a new company building furniture. It's decent stuff and you have it built in the Caymans so your cost is cheap and you make money. Take the company public and issue stock with an IPO. \\n\\nWhen the stock soars on the IPO, sell your shares and start a subsidiary, and put all your money into that new company making T-shirts. Of course, the furniture company's stock fell considerably, because you took all of the cash out. \\n\\nWhen you make money on T-shirts, go public, and when the IPO soars, sell your shares, and buy back the furniture stock at depressed levels. Of course, the T-shirt stock goes down the tubes, because you pulled the cash out, but hey, you're making a killing onthe stock.\\n\\nThis is legal manipulation. You've been warned. Penny stocks are very risky for a reason, or lots of reasons. Buy something with known value, that's been around awhile, and will continue to be around. So what if you can't buy as many shares? You can still double your money, and reduce your risk in half, by investing in the future of a stable company not ran or manipulated by shysters.\n\nAnswer:",

Please provide evidence.?\nQuestion: A friend mentioned this the other day, and I'm having a hard time believing that it could be.  Just throwing it out there.\nAnswer: The 9/11 Truth Movement will hopefully catch on, it would be nice to actually have a \"resolved\" situation rather than 50 years of speculation like the JFK assassination (another definitely inside job).\\n\\nUnfortunately, this movement is being hijacked by anti-semetic hate groups, xenophobes, tin-foil hat-wearers, and left-wing gun nuts.  It sucks that this would be allowed to happen and the real conspirators (the Bushies) are going to use extremism to get away with murdering fellow americans.\\n\\nA lot of people benefitted HUGE from the events of 9/11, and our mainstream media has done absolutely no real investigative journalism to bring this out.  Along with that though, our Constitutional rights have been completely stripped and suspended without a whisper from the mainstream press.  Nobody batted an eye when our rights to free press, redress, fair trials, habeus corpus, eminent domain protections were completely stripped.\n\nAnswer:",

Oh and also the reason i broke up with him was because he wanted to control me and i had to do everything he said. What kind of crap is that. he asked me for a 2nd chance b/c he messed up the first time, so he told me he didnt care what people said about us and that he knew he liked me alot and that he just wanted to be with me, but then 2 or 3 weeks later he brakes up w/ me again. :(:( but i still like him. what do i do.\nAnswer: No christian man should treat a woman of any riligion with disrespect and that is what he's doing to you. He's disrespecting you by trying to control your actions and not treating you like an individual.

Literally drawing our own blood with sterile materials and mixing them with the antigens to see what blood type we were. \\n\\nExcept that I couldn't get the blood to come out of the side of my finger. I stabbed a few more times and tried to squeeze a few drops out. But it wasn't enough to test. Then I felt really light headed and everyone told me I looked pale. The teacher even went so far as to tell me to put my head between my legs for a few minutes. So my question is what happened back there? Is this some weird survival instinct? Or do I have bad circulation in my hands? Or something else?\nAnswer: Nothing to worry about, you're just one of those types that faint at the sight of blood.  Just kidding, you were probably holding your breath the whole time you were sticking yourself.  Next time breath regularly and not too shallow.  By the way, I cowered out, my teacher had to stab my finger.  That was an adrenalin rush!\n\nAnswer:",

Virtually any organ can be affected, however, granulomas most often appear in the lungs (D860) or the lymph nodes (D861). Symptoms can occasionally appear suddenly but more often than not appear gradually. When viewing X-rays of the lungs, sarcoidosis can have the appearance of tuberculosis or lymphoma.\n\nAnswer:",

Was it the agent you hired, doing rehab work that didn't pay off, not hiring a good inspector, financing? \\n\\nWhat do you wish you knew then that you know now and will apply to your next real estate transaction?  Thanks!\nAnswer: The one thing I think about is when I bought a rental property, I made my offer, not knowing about negotiating tactics.  The buyer agent had me sign a dual agency agreement, and I don't think he had my best interests at heart. I offered a low price and ended up paying full price.  I was naive to the fact that he was not on my side, and also, I should have asked for closing costs or some other bargaining chip.  And I should have stood my ground on the slightly lower price, after coming up some.  Being in the investor shoes, the buyer needed me more than I needer her.  I could've walked away, but she needed to sell.  So she probably would've taken the lower price had I stopped.  Overall, I do not regret the investment, it was good, I am also lucky because I didn't order an inspection!!!  (Naive again) Lucky it was in good shape.  But it also could've been a bargaining chip.  Had I gotten a lower price, I'd of had more equity now.\n\nAnswer:",

This is a big developmental hurdle which is the main reason for why they dont fit in or are emotionally held back\\n\\nIn the right environment children with aspergers can intergrate very well. In schools depending on what part of the spectrum they fall, they may be better off in a main stream school maybe with the help of a learning support assistant. \\n\\nIn the uk children can be statemented which will qualify them to have free extra support within a school.\\n\\nAspergeric children can be disruptive or sometimes the complete opposite and very introverted. As I said with the right support, patience and understanding of adults and peers they can do very well.\\n\\nAs for the teacher who commented that the aspergeric child she knows that \"will never live alone\"etc etc...\\nyou cant say that about all aspergeric children.

So any electricity you put into the lake would leave immediately. Thus, you would have to put a tremendous amount of power all at once. Frankly, I don't think you could do it, because we can't even produce as much electricity as is in a lightning bolt in one second. A lightning strike would only affect one small section of the lake. Thus it would take multiple lightning strikes right next to each other.\n\nAnswer:",

That doesn't disprove the authenticity of the Bible at all. The Bible was written by many, many different people and to hundreds of different audiences. The writers of each book was just giving different advice to different people. Besides, you can't take everything in the Bible literally. It's impossible....\nAnswer: If everybody could approach the Bible as rationally as you do, then there would be no need to point out contradictions. But so many millions of people do take the Bible as the infallible word of God and to be interpreted completely literally. Using a flawed book as the sole code by which you live is dangerous, and Atheists feel obliged to point this outto them.\n\nAnswer:",

How have you done it? I am not beautiful and I struggle with the problem of being overlooked, most especially by the opposite sex. My biggest problem with being unattractive isn't that I am unattractive. It is that people overlook me. How do you deal with that?\nAnswer: I think you live in a society that gives too much on the appearance. In fact, I believe the attraction only comes the fist few seconds you notice a person, then once you are getting engage into a conversation, the looks don't really appear to be matter any longer. I've had many beautiful girlfriends before, and once you are getting into a fight with them, the looks don't count anymore. In fact, once you got to know a person or live with them, the looks hardly matter as you will not notice it as much as before you got to really know that person and talk to them.\n\nAnswer:",

It uses a rotary \"piston\" instead of the common up-and-down strokes of a standard i.c. engine.  Altho it was first used in an NSU RO-80 [I think that's the correct model number], it was Mazda that brought the Wankel engine into the public consciousness via a sedan as well as the early RX-series of sports car; I believe the rotary-engined Mazdas first appeared in the early- to mid-seventies\n\nAnswer:",

The restriction of trial and punishment by the international tribunal to personnel of the Axis countries has led to accusations of victor's justice and that Allied war crimes could not be tried. However it is usual that the armed forces of a civilised country  issue their forces with detailed guidance on what is and is not permitted under their military code. These are drafted to include any international treaty obligations and the customary laws of war. For example at the trial of Otto Skorzeny his defence was in part based on the Field Manual published by the War Department of the United States Army, on 1 October 1940, and the American Soldiers' Handbook.\\n\\n The unconditional surrender of the Axis powers was unusual and led directly to the formation of the international tribunals. Usually international wars end conditionally and the treatment of suspected war criminals makes up part of the peace treaty. In most cases those who are not prisoners of war are tried under their own judicial system if they are suspected of committing war crimes \u2013 as happened the end of the concurrent Continuation War and led to the war-responsibility trials in Finland. In restricting the international tribunal to trying suspected Axis war crimes, the Allies were acting within normal international law.\\n\\nThe legal basis for the jurisdiction of the court was that defined by the Instrument of Surrender of Germany, political authority for Germany had been transferred to the Allied Control Council which having sovereign power over Germany could choose to punish violations of international law and the laws of war. Because the court was limited to violations of the laws of war, it did not have jurisdiction over crimes that took place before the outbreak of war on September 1, 1939.\n\nAnswer:",

How many of you pro-lifers out there have an adopted kid or a foster child? I don't hear many pro-lifers offering solutions, only judgement.

Kids that young are too imature to completely understand how complicated it is.  That is why the school systems/governements shouldn't be giving out birth control, or saying it's ok if you get pregnant and want to have an abortion.  What ever happened to suffering the consequences of making bad decisions?  That is how you grow as a person.  It's ok to make mistakes if you own up to them.  The solution is to not make sex seem like such a casual thing, so that young people don't find it so acceptable. There is still hope.\n\nAnswer:",

First of all, the claims about chemical memory apply to planarian flatworms, NOT leaches.  Second of all, only one scientist claimed to have produced those effects.  Nobody else has been able to duplicate those experiments, hence they're regarded as false.\\n\\nIt doesn't really matter where you got it from, it's still false.  I've heard professional scientists report it as well.  So what?  Professional scientists are not inerrant.  This story got widespread publicity in the seventies and like all stories that hit the media, the retraction hardly got any attention at all.\\n\\nKeep in mind, when I say the experiment couldn't be duplicated, I mean FROM THE GROUND UP.

If yes, a secretary is basically a scribe and keeper of records of an organization. He/she makes the necessary paperworks for the higher officer's approval such as letters, proposals, etc. In an office, the task is pretty much the same in general, but an office secretary is more clerical in function which includes transcribing and writing the letters of the boss, filing, answering the fones, scheduling the boss's time, do other stuff the boss requires, etc.\\n\\nThe treasurer is the keeper of financial accounts. Most of the time, the treasurer holds the purse of an org. But he/she is the most likely person accountable for the wrongful disbursement of money. The treasurer should know how to monitor where the money goes so that s/he can regularly report the org's financial status. s/he should keep receipts or evidences of where the money is being used.\\n\\nIn some organizations, to prevent misuse of funds, bank accounts are co-signed by other officers besides the treasurer. So both signatories are the most accountable for embezzlement in unfortunate cases.\\n\\nP.S. In check the organization's bylaws and guidelines because some orgs have additional tasks for each positions, e.g. secretary sometimes dual-tasks as media officer, etc.\n\nAnswer:",

Is he creative? Let him express his anger by painting, drawing, or writing. Is he athletic? He can let go of his boxed up emotions by boxing, swimming, or maybe track.\\n\\nIt all depends on what his hobbies are. Maybe he might be better off talking about it, or maybe just doing something else I haven't suggested. I'm the same way, but I've taken up writing. \\n\\nIf you have any questions, feel free to e-mail me.\n\nAnswer:",

Help!!! Please explain your answer!\nAnswer: If you are describing yourself (you said you're a girl) it's desordenada.\\n\\nFrom your question I can see that you're still confused with the grammar rules of Spanish.  This is not conjugation, but rather creation of an adjective from a verb.  When you do this (in general) you drop the -ar, and add 'ado' if you're talking about a masculine noun and 'ada' if you're talking about a feminine noun.  That's why \"desordenado\" would be the adjective to describe a boy and \"desordenada\" would be the adjective to describe a girl.\\n\\n'des' is always the prefix in Spanish.  There's no 'dis'.\n\nAnswer:",

The next day I was so convinced it was going to happen. I couldn't tell her in case it made her worry and she did have an accident, but I told a couple of other people so I would know that I wasn't going mad when it happened (it was a case of when and not if - such a vivid dream!) She made it through almost the whole day and I had almost forgotten when she tripped over a wall (low on our side but the floor was much further down on the other side) and fell quite far. She broke one of her legs but other than that she was okay. I have always wondered why I had that dream. I don't know if I should have warned her or if I just would have been guilty for the rest of my life and felt that I had caused it. Because I felt such a strong link to her accident we are now close friends and I have since told her about the dream. She thinks it is a bit weird but it didn't worry her too much.\\n\\nWhat do you mean by just...er...um...curious?!\n\nAnswer:",

My friends told me it would an I wanted to make sure befor I buy one.\nAnswer: Ok, on top of what everyone else has already said, you need to know your local hunting laws. In some areas it is ILLEGAL to hunt deer with a 410. You need to research the hunting laws in your area. As for its effectiveness: you have an approximately 110 grain 45cal. (about) slug, fired from a shotgun shell at 1,700 ft per second, with a muzzle energy of around 770 ft/pounds of energy........ more than enough to kill a deer if you hit the vital area. I'd still prefer a larger caliber just for the extra impact energy (my .20 ga. gives well over 2000 ft/pounds muzzle energy), but that's simply my preference.\n\nAnswer:",

Up to a PO2 of 60 mm Hg, Hemoglobin is still substantially saturated with O2 and adequate amounts of O2 can be delivered to tissues and the brain. Also, when PO2 drops from 100 - 60, usually there is also increased PCO2 levels. So, ventilation is usually increased due to response of central and peripheral chemoreceptors to increasing PCO2 levels.\n\nAnswer:",

We keep fighting over this matter and it is unhealthy for our relationship.\\n\\nAm I being controling and interfering? I'm just looking for any comments and advice on how I should handle this.\nAnswer: certainly defer marriage until he gets his finances in order.  You don't want/need his credit card debt.

It's simply a full moon. it got its name because Pilgrims used to go out on these nights because they were lit up from the moon. The pilgrims would then take their muskets and look up into the trees where the turkeys were roosted and the pilgrims could clearly see the turkeys figures in the light of the moon. The pilgrims would then proceed to shoot the turkeys. The turkeys were so dumb that they wouldn't move even when their fellow turkeys were shot so Pilgrims could take as many as they wanted. I just dont see any way for them to preserve the amount of turkeys they took?!?\n\nAnswer:",

I know it's been a month since the incident with their dog but I feel more confident now about doing it and I decided I'm only going to sue them for $900 dollars.  They sent me a certified letter saying that I told them their dog didn't break the skin on my leg, which I did say but the ER doctor said I was lucky that he didn't tear into me.  That is why I'm suing.  I wrote exactly that as the facts for the basis of my claim in the lawsuit: to take to court : The ER dr. said it was lucky he didn't tear into me.  The dog didn't break skin and I know he couldn't see who I was in the dark in front of his house and their usually are lots of dogs barking in the neighborhood so at first I didn't think anything of it.   Just the fact that I had to go through that should be fact enough for lawsuit. Also my ER bill was 400 but only because of a waiver.  Had I had insurance it would have been $900 so thats what Im suing for\nAnswer: You idot.\\n\\nThis is the reason my insurance goes up! Cuz I have to pay for a dumbass like yourself who wants to make a few quick bucks.\\n\\nIf you are having such money problems - get a second job. Or, move back in with your parents. Or, go to a homeless shelter. But, don't make my life miserable because you decided to have kids before you were ready.\\n\\nAnd, no, you won't win. \\n\\nWhat was your injury?\\n\\nIn order to have standing to sue you must prove you had an injury. If the dog did not break the skin, and you stated this to the doctor (duh), you have no standing. Your case will be dismissed via summary judgment.\n\nAnswer:",

Is this true?\nAnswer: You won't get cancer if you tear a mole off. You can get cancer if the mole is unusual changing in shape or colour and had not hair follicle. If hair can grow from the mole well then it's not malignant. The only problem with tearing off moles is that they are very hard to stop bleeding, and that is why a doctor should do it by freezing it or removing it and stitching the skin. If they do remove it they usually take it to be tested to make sure it's not a form of cancer.\n\nAnswer:",

Corporate animal farms hurt the environment, the consumer and the animals under there control. Therefore corporate animal farms are harmful and should be phased out of there current existence. Consuming factory farmed meat by humans is primarily for pleasure, (it tastes good) and is unnecessary since a plant based diet has been proven to be healthier and can taste great as well. Corporate animal farms consume large amounts of water and other natural resources and produce vast amounts of waste which pollutes the environment. To cause pain and death to an animal and harm the environment for the trivial purpose of pleasuring an individual\u2019s immediate sensual gratification without considering how the product is produced is irresponsible. \\n\\n\\n\\n1) some religion thinks that all animals are living things and thus, they should not be killed. \\n2) in geo, if we eat more meat, more people will have less to eat because of the food pyramid. a cow eats so much plants in a liofe time and the amount of plants can feed so many people but that cow can only feed a few people.\\n3)mad cow disease, H5N1 disease. it's too dangerous. \\n4) extinction, we have to protect them\\n5)with technology, we can produced vegeterian meat, for ex, the canned duck that's made from plants.\\n6)animal waste causes polution.\\n7) there's population explosion going on and land sacarcity, we don't have ebough resources for them.\\n8)The use of horses for meat production is widely opposed in countries such as USA and Britain where horses are considered companion and sporting animals.There is an effort in the United State to create a law, the American Horse Slaughter Prevention Act, designed to stop the slaughter of horses.\\nPolls sponsored by various American organisations have shown that most people are not aware that horses are slaughtered in the US for consumption overseas. According to some of these polls, in New York, 64% of people polled actually believed that slaughtering horses for meat was illegal, while in Indiana, 91% believe that horse slaughter should be banned. [7] An overwhelming majority of Texas voters (89%) are unaware that horse slaughter goes on in their own state. [8]\\nFrench animal rights activist Brigitte Bardot has spent her latter years crusading against the eating of horse meat.\\n8) there's growing meat lab nowadays and the meat is better.\\n9) it's time that people be more civilise, work in cities instead of farming.\\n10),eet.. especially red meat is very unhealthy. Too mush fats make us fat\\n\\n\\n\\nNO beacuse......\\n1)god gave us these animals to eat.\\n2) we can't be vegeterians. we need the energy.\\n3)if we don't eat them, the food chain will be affect because if there is a raise in the secondary consumer, the number of primary consumer will drop.\\n4)variety of food.\\n5) if the animals, eat all the plants, there will be nothing to hold the soil. \\n6)we do not have enough land for planting crops. example, less than 2/5 of america's fertile land is used for planting but for building things.\\n7) when there is a demand for these animals, more people will have jobs and there will be more animal waste to be used as fertilisers.\\n8)Horse meat is sweet, tender, low in fat, and high in protein.[1] Just like beef and pork, in some societies there is a taboo regarding the consumption of horse meat.\\nHorse meat has had somewhat of a resurgence in popularity in Europe and Canada in recent years, as horses are not susceptible to BSE (mad cow disease).\\nHorse meat has about 40% less calories than even the leanest beef, while supplying 50% more protein and up to 30% more iron.\n\nAnswer:",

My mum went back to nursing school at about 34, she wound up graduating near the top of her class - with a 3.97 GPA.  I didn't manage that on my bachelor's, and I went straight from high school.\\n\\nMy dad went back and got a COTA certification a few years after that, graduated and had absolutely no problems getting really good jobs.  Both of them had not attended any sort of college since they were 18 and married.  My father, in fact, wound up doing an \"academic bankruptcy\" on most of his classes, since he had things like a D in trigonometry (which he didn't even remember taking!!).  I don't remember his GPA, but it was like mine, somewhere above a 3.5 (but not a 3.97 - my mum set the bar WAY high.)\\n\\nThey both pointed out a couple of advantages and disadvantages to going back so late - one advantage I remember my mum and dad both mentioning was that when they did get placed in a job, they were able to start at slightly higher pay rates and were placed into supervisory positions fairly quickly due to other experience (ie, my dad did 18 years in the military and had been trained in management techniques which transferred over, etc).  A disadvantage I remember them discussing was that you have a harder time forming study groups and such while you're in class, because a lot of younger students aren't that responsible, although by med school I bet a lot of that's eliminated.\\n\\nGood luck, you're going to stress over tests, practicals, and clinicals, but don't stress too much, I'm sure you'll do fine.  Older students tend to approach their schoolwork like a job, so you don't run into the issues of missing lecture and such.  :)\n\nAnswer:",

There's apparently nothing to worry about, according to my research, this is a normal thing. It's usually caused by a minor blockage in the seminal vescicles, and it's kind of the same reason you get an occasional bloody booger, a capillary ruptured because of the pressure, leaking blood into the spooge. After a couple of slightly bloody loads, it cleared itself up on it's own. I found it usually happens after a particularly energetic romp in the hay. Don't worry about it, unless it's for a prolonged period, or there's WAY too much blood.\n\nAnswer:",

Two things were happening while you were jogging.\\n\\n1.Your feet and legs were absorbing impact energy from the act of running. This is no different from hitting the palm of your hand against the table top over and over again. The atoms in your hand swell from the absorbed energy and then once you stop hitting the table, slowly release that energy in an attempt to get back to their normal existing ground state. the transferring or processing of that absorbed energy will feel like itching which is really just a lesser degree of pain.\\n\\n2.Your legs were also releasing stored energy throughout your leg muscles during your run, adding to the absorbed energy from running. \\n\\nThis is also why a sunburn will itch like crazy, absorbed solar energy is finding a way out of your body.\\n\\nAs your body cools down the itching may get worse, because cooling will close your pores, trapping the heat.\\n\\nHope this helps\n\nAnswer:",

I have only just got out of debt to find my partner and I are having a baby..(which we are both really excited about)\\n\\nProblem is, I need to try and accumulate as much capital as possible as quickly as possible in order to provide a stable environment for little one, as I say I have no savings behind me, and there are only a finite number of hours in the week in which to earn money. I know I should have been better prepared, but can anyone give some advice??\nAnswer: Just have moderation in everything you do. Don't eat out, forgo movies and other entertainment you have to pay for, have a yard sale of your unwanted things, I knew a lady once who made $500 on a yard sale.  You'll have to get creative to save money on entertainment, but many communites have free concerts, or you can go for a walk in the part.  If it's possible, you and your partner can get a second, part-time job.  Or go to a temp agency and take some extra jobs that way.

Your love is the best thing you can give them. Just make sure that you make them feel accepted; sometimes, older people are afraid that younger people consider them as inferior and therefore tend to take everything more personally. So treat them like the normal people they are. Remember that they were once babies, once kids, once teenagers, once young adults... So don't try being all \"what can I do for you? Don't do that, you'll hurt yourself\" and stuff like many people tend to do. I know that comes from a good intention, but the truth is, a lot of times, grandparents don't want that from their grandchildren. Sometimes, they just want to be treated as friends, to feel young again... And yes there is a grandparent day. It's september 11, I think.\n\nAnswer:",

WHEN WE 1ST GOT MARRIED WE DECIDED THAT WE WANTED TO HAVE 1 CHILD TOGETHER...MIND YOU I ALREADY HAD A 3MONTH OLD THAT WASN'T HIS....I HAD MY SON B4 WE GOT INVOLVED....BUT KNOW HE DOESN'T WANT TO HAVE KIDS AND ITS ALWAYS BEEN MY DREAM TO HAVE 2 KIDS....AM I WRONG FOR BEING PISSED BECAUSE HE HAS CHANGED HIS MIND? I FEEL LIKE WE MADE PLANS AND HE KNEW HE DIDN'T WANT TO HAVE ANY KIDS... I ALSO FEEL HE SHOULDN'T HAVE MARRIED AND BEEN A FATHER TO MY NOW 9MONTH OLD SON.. IF HE DIDN'T REALLY WANT TO. HE HAS BEEN IN MY SONS LIFE AS HIS FATHER SINCE MY SON WAS 2WEEKS OLD AND NOW HE WANTS TO JUST UP AND LEAVE AND I'M SUPPOSED TO BE OKAY WITH...THAT HOW DO I STOP THE EVIL THOUGHTS RUNNING THROUGH MY HEAD I'M SO HURT I THINK I'M SLIDING INTO A DEEP DEPRESSION......HELP WHAT SHOULD I DO?\nAnswer: At least part of what you should do is wait. I'm a man. All men want to leave progeny. It is a biological imperitive. It sounds like he's just jealous. I hope to God your 9 month old isn't shunned by your new husband.\\n\\nMen want kids (whether they admit it or not--see, there's a macho component to \"siring\" off-spring, it is medieval, outgrown). \\n\\nSome argue that humans, like other mammals, will only care for, really care for, their own kids-- with their genes. I don't buy this. All of us alive today share genes. It's one family, for real.\\n\\nBut this guy may be trying to incite a kind of hurt in you (he's succeeding) because it hurts him that he didn't father the 3/9 month old. Get it? But he'll come around! I promise.\\n\\nI don't get why he did this either, if he knew about the 3-month old-he went back on his promise. Is he compulsive? Are you wealthy with your own money? People are not logical most times. That's why \"game theory\" doesn't work at the Pentagon or on Wall Street. We do things for neurotic, maybe self-destructive reasons. Maybe you need outside help. A marraige counselor, a shrink or two. \\n\\nDid anything change? Did he meet someone else? Think about that kind of thing. How long did you know him before marrying him, 2 1/2 months. Or maybe 3???? If so, that's not long enough. Is your Mom still alive? She'd be angry at you. Oh, I just got it:\\n\\nHe thinks you married him ONLY so he'll take care of your child from another person. You need a breadwinner, or at least two bread winner's, to raise a kid these days, so you married him solely so as to care for, pay for, your child.... I bet that is it. Still, you guys had wanted kids've your own, which makes it all even and ok. So there's something missing from your question. Btw, I'd get to a shrink about that depression. True major depression is crippling and life-threatening. Use words with care. True depression (clinical sense) is endogenous, of the body and heritable. So be careful.\\n\\nRemind the guy that one doesn't use one's kid(s) as \"weapons\" to fight the spouse with... which everyone does anyway. There's more to this: you've left out or I missed something critical. But here's the general deal:\\n\\nFirst, wait patiently. He'll change his mind again. He wants kids, we all do (us guys). If he doesn't change in, say, 6 months, he's got or having a kid with someone else I'd bet. Ask. If so he'll be a financial mess I shd think.\\n\\nAlso: tell him all about what it means to be a Dad, really be a Dad; and that, yes, you want HIM, you chose him, to be this child's Dad.\\n\\nTell him every damn day. For a month at least.\\n\\nFinally, use sex as a weapon if you have to. Be creative. You know what he likes? Use that knowledge to give it to him, if you love him.\\n\\nHey, how to change the mind of the most stubborn guys, even in the Bible, that vixen got Sampson to cut his hair.... (Delilah, now I recall.) Making him weak (impotent). The story is saying that civilizing a man takes some of his power away. That hurts him.\\n\\nSo get ready to remind him, in about one month:\\nBeing a Dad, in reality, is much more than biological parenting and soccer practice. Anyone can do that. It's raising a bright, well-adjusted (whatever that means) young adult, few can do that. Too few.\\n\\nAnd, as mentioned, all human beings are related, so for goodnes' sake, what is the difference. OK, there is a difference. But in the past, we didn't know there's only one species of human. Mapping Human History, a new trade paperback in the popular science section of the bookstore, does a great job explaining this. \\n\\nI can see cuckoldry really hurting a guy. But not more. So why'd he marry? Why'd you marry. Good luck. PS: Do you have a sister or girlfriend he likes--be careful--its there or at work that you could lose him to another wom\n\nAnswer:",

Misunderstanding about Islam and its followers on their part\\n2. Misunderstanding about God(Allah) and the prophet Jesus the Son Of Marry(peace be upon him) on their part\\n3. Personal Ego\\nI am a muslim and come from a muslim family as well. I frankly believe that muslims are not portraying the true picture of Islam.\\nPersonally i go do agree with George Bernard Shaw's saying:\\n\"Islam is the best religion and muslims are the best followers\".\\nAnd i frankly feel it is not appropriate to call them cowards.The Quran says that Allah does not force to convert  anyone to Islam and believe him and niether the muslims should do. There are so many cowards livnig among us e.g. our political leaders.\\nThe Quran and the Prophet Muhammad(peace be upon him) have taught to us observe tolerance with the People Of The Book(Jews and Christains) as long as they believe in one and only one God.\\nPlease do not offend anyone's faith or any follower if you are interested to invite them to convert to Islam or like to have an inter-faith dialogue.\n\nAnswer:",

Mark described Jesus going from Tyrian territory 'by way of Sidon to the Sea of Galilee through the territory of the Ten Towns' (Mark 7:31); this is similar to saying that one goes from London to Paris by way of Edinburgh and Rome.\nAnswer: Not only yes, but it makes you an intelligent one!!\\n\\nRemember this book was still written by men, not god himself.\n\nAnswer:",

There is no chamber length stamped on the barrel.\nAnswer: Bound's hubby here: \\n\\nExpect that your Springfield double is chambered for 2.75\" 12 guage shells. Twelve guage shells were also once offered in 2 9/16\" length, but the chances your shotgun is chambered for these shells is really slim ... about equal to you having Osama Bin Laden at your dining room table for Thanksgiving dinner!\\n\\nEDITED TO ADD! Do NOT drop a 3\" shell into a 2 3/4\" chamber, this will give you a false indication! Shotgun chambers are cut long, because the folded \"crimp\" opens up into the chamber extension. If this did not happen, the shot and wad would be constricted as it passes into the barrel, increasing chamber pressure to the point that you are risking a blow-up of your barrel! If you use the \"drop test\" and see that a 3\" shell falls into the chamber, and you use a 3\" Magnum (the only 3\" shell), you are not only risking destruction of your shotgun, but also risking bodily harm!\\n\\nGood luck!\n\nAnswer:",

You can't! But if, as most people think, you've lived the experience before, you should have no problem remembering what is to follow. Here's why you can never remember what will follow. When we experience anything, our brain records it and stores it as a memory. Then that memory is \"filed\" so that when we recall it, we can determine the sequence of the event, i.e. was this recent, or years ago? When the brain \"misfiles' a current event as being something in the past, it recognizes that event and we feel we've experienced it before. But actually, our brain is comparing the current event to itself! That's why we can never follow through with what happens next...because it hasn't happened yet! And that, my friend is deja vu!\n\nAnswer:",

However, in the same book of the bible (leviticus), it says women must hide from the world during their periods, and not be touched by anyone or they are all declared \"unclean\" and are to be punished.\\nIt also says there that you should stone adulterers and fornicators, that you must offer various sacrifices of meat and blood several times a week...why do christians choose to follow the prohibition against homosexuality (and foist that view on everyone else), and not the other prohibitions and laws in the same book?  Selective enforcement at its worst.\\n\\nIn the new testament, jesus said that his new law replaced the old law (Mosaic law from the old testament).  His new commandment was to love one another, to do good to those who use you, to turn the other cheek, to not judge anyone.  \\n\\nHow sad it is that the vast majority of christians choose to ignore the person they claim to follow, and instead choose to selectively pick parts of the \"old law\" to use as their rallying cry against \"immorality.\"  Jesus would be ashamed of those who do so.\n\nAnswer:",

Why or why not?\nAnswer: I personally think that public school children should wear school uniforms. \\nI think this because it would instill a sense of discipline in students with is desperately needed in these times. \\n\\nAlso, if everyone was to wear uniforms there would be less segregation amongst the pupils in the schools. This is so because a student might be shunned upon since he/she is not wearing the \"brand name\" clothes that the other kids are and that might give the person thoughts that he/she is not as good as the others. A uniform will make all students equals.\\n\\nFinally, if there were uniforms in schools ,i think, the rate of teenage sex and thus pregnancy would stop. Without uniforms, the students would wear whatever they want. More specifically the girls will dress is those sexy clothes that will definitely attract boys and then one thing leads to another and ...\n\nAnswer:",

Tradition is no reason to continue a practice.  To say that we should prohibit gays from marrying because we have not allowed it up til now and marriage has traditionally be between a man and a woman it no different that that standard answer your parents gave you when you asked why you could not eat your dessert first -- \"because we say so.\"  Makes no sense.  It offers no logic.  Guess what else is tradition -- traditionally we don't let jews play at our golf courses.  And traditionally we don't let blacks marry whites (there were actually laws on the book in most states, so it went beyond tradition, it was the law).  Traditionally, children slept on their stomaches, until the scientists told us that the chances of SIDS skyrocketed when an infant doesn't sleep on its back.  So don't give me that tradition garbage.  We don't continue doing things just because that how it has always been done.  The american people deserve better than that -- we deserve to know how it benefits the overall society.  The bottomline is that monogomy and marital committment is a major benefit to modern society, whether it is between opposite sexes or the same sexes.\n\nAnswer:",

The most you could get on the assignment was 50/50. When we were done, our Social Studies teacher wrote and cirlced 50 on our paper, which would be a 100%, and me and my group were happy. As me and my group were sitting in our seats, the next group started to do their skit. In the begining they said, \"Good morning Mrs. (teacher's name) and class.\"\\nThen our teacher looked at me, motioned me to her desk, crossed out the 50, and wrote 48. Then she said\\n\"You forgot to say Good Morning Mrs. (teacher's name). That means we had  100%, and went down to 96%. At my school that would be an A-. Why would she do that? She didn't mark any other groups' grade down because they didn't say that. Is that even, how do I say, \"legal\", to do? I don't know how to put it.

So far from what I've seen he ref'd the Ecuador-Germany game and Saturday's Portugal-Holland game where he was handing out yellows and reds like candy. But in general there's been some serious fouls that haven't been called that I think would deserve a card and some not so serious ones that end up getting cards. Its just really frustrating to watch teams pour their hearts and souls in a great match and have it end as a result of some bad officiating. That's all. Just wanted opinions from others out there!\nAnswer: No, I think the refereeing in the past has been bad. The players have been allowed to run wild for so long. Finally, some boundries are being set and the players are walking right over those boundries. There are consequences for such actions.\\n\\nIt is the PLAYER'S job to learn what will and won't be allowed, and the way these players are so slow to learn, I wonder how many brain cells they have.\\n\\n95% of the calls and 99% of the cards I have seen can be backed up by the Laws of the Game.\n\nAnswer:",

Welfare was designed to help people who are in the situation that you are in right now. You will still be able to go to school, but you would be given financial help to pay your bills, food stamps for food and even help with medical and dental. Once you are back on your feet you can get off welfare. Good Luck!\\n@--->---\n\nAnswer:",

Or how much it usually is for another gym.  Thanks\nAnswer: I'm a member for fitness first too, depend which country you in. In Australia, it cost about $40 a month for student and you can only go to one particular fitness first. If you pay $80 a month (adult) you can go to any fitness first gym. \\n\\nBut you should negotiate heavily, because they will pressure you into signing up. Alot of people got the price down to $60 a month instead of $80. A trick, at the end pretend you don't want to join, they ask why, just said it cost too much then they will reduce the price for you because they don't want to lose customer.\n\nAnswer:",

They can pick up quite small items and rotate in front of their lips using the trunk and tusk combination to strip off the leaves etc.  They also use the trunk to strip the bark off of trees,scrape earth up to dig water holes and mineral scrapes, and for defence - although their large size makes them fairly predator proof.\\nIndian elephants have smaller tusks than African elephants because they have evolved as a jungle species and the bigger tusks would get in the way in the undergrowth etc, plus the lusher vegetation means they do not need to scrape for water etc.\n\nAnswer:",

I think that I am overweight, but people that look at me don't believe that I weigh 138. I just tell them that they need to see me naked to tell.. which i won't let them. But anyway, if that to heavy?? what is an ideal weight? i don't want to look anorexic or anything, just thinner, and toned.\nAnswer: I know exactly what you mean, I am considered overweight according to the scale chart I have provided. I am 5'1 as well and I am about 135 lbs. But what you need to take in cosideration is your body frame. Are u a small, medium, or large frame body. If you can grip your wrist with your thumb and your pointer finger then ur small frame if not then you gotta estimate approximately how much space theres between those two fingers and label yourself as medium or large frame, then refer to the chart to see your ideal weight for you height.\\n\\nBut you know that its good to know that as long as you dont look your weight then its all good. Unfortunately when we see ourselves nude we feel fat, but with clothes you can hide those rolls and love handles. So decide how much weight you need to loose, Im sure its not alot, maybe some situps will just tone your stomach and you dont need to loose pounds.\\n\\ngood luck.\n\nAnswer:",

The USA was not offering anywhere near the amount of lost revenue.\\n\\n2-The United States was asking for Turkey to supply troops and access for a fight against what our government said were anti-US terrorists while offering no assistance at all against anti-Turkish terrorists (Kurds, Armenians, etc), even though Turkey has been a loyal member of NATO and ally of the United States since the 1950's.\\n\\n3-By creating a defacto autonomous Kurdish state in northern Iraq via the 'No Fly Zones' since 1992, the United States had turned a blind eye to the trafficing in weapons and political support to wha the Turkish government feels are isurgents inside Turkey. By replacing the Hussein regime with a potentially unstable successor state, Turkey felt this trafficking could lead to instability in the entire region (there are Kurdish minorities in Turkey, Iran, Iraq, former Soviet Union, etc).\n\nAnswer:",

Unlike other types of fantasies, since you had a previous relationship with him, you have more of a frame of reference to work from.

You can go to the SBA about a loan at http://www.sba.gov, or if you live in a fiar sized city, there may be a local sba. Traditional banks will consider loaning too, but they will expect you to pony up or raise a lot of the cash on your own.\\n\\nAs far as other to invest in your business, I think you may be looking for a venture capitalist or \"angel.\"  A venture capital firm or angel investor can provide you with startup monies, but it is usually an investment, not a loan, which means they would own a portion of your business, be able to sell their part, and have their say in how you run it.  Have a look at http://www.vfinance.com/\\n\\nA third option would be a grant....if you are a woman or minority, these are fairly common....just search on Yahoo here for small business grant woman or small business grant <<<insert race here>>>.\\n\\nBest of luck!

My wife insists there's nothing wrong with her.\n\nAnswer:",

Now women usually plop one leg on top of the other when they sit. Does anyone know who or what started this change?\nAnswer: When women wore very tight skirts which were below the knee, they were unable to cross their legs, so they only crossed their ankles to relax.  Now women wear slacks, jeans and shorter skirts that do allow for leg crossing, so that's the preferred stance.  It's comfortable - even if sometimes a little too showy.\n\nAnswer:",

Lots of 'em but I'd have to say, the first century I did in Marietta, OH. At Mile 45 I was thinking of backing out and taking the 70 mile route. A couple of girls I was riding with talked me into doing the whole thing, so then I was committed. It was cold, in the upper 40's/low 50's. I couldn't keep up with the fast guys on the flats but I could usually outperform them on the climbs, much to my surprise and delight. I waited up for the girls and at ~mile 80 they waived me off. I was cold, sore and ready for it to end. Then it started to pour. That last 15 miles I did like a reckless kid. I was having fun. I think I was getting delirious at that point. When I made it to the finishing point I was ready to go for another 50 miles. \\n\\nMade me wonder what kind of masochist I was becoming. But I did it, not only the 100 miles, but 100 miles with lots of steep climbs thrown in. Hey, I did it!\n\nAnswer:",

Interestingly enough, this about coincides with the cycle of the moon and there are animals which only mate during a full moon.  Although not proved, it is possible that somewhere in our evolutionary past, we had an ancestor who found that mating during a full moon improved its chances of survival.  Another theory is that the 28-day cycle prevents multiple pregnancies (i.e., multiple fertile eggs in the uterus) with multiple ages--something that could be harmful to the woman's and fetus's health.\n\nAnswer:",

They each applied to just one school and were accepted ED. THat was that. My third kid just didnt know what he wanted to do in college. He was a great student and had lots of choices. So he didnt apply ED anywhere, he applied to nine schools and got accepted by eight. But by the time the acceptance came he had thought about things more and was ready to make a decision. It was still tough but he felt better about it than if he had to decide in October. \\n\\nI think that most of the schools should keep the ED.

He came into our house while a 14 year old child was alone, saw her and ran out.   It's a neighbor who lives across the street.  He actually confessed to the sheriffs officers eventually, and stated he had been entering our home and using our computer.  He was charged with trespassing.  \\n\\nThis is a person who we have never invited into our home, we did not even know his name until this incident.\\n\\n\\nWhen we went to sign papers on him, the clerk stated that he would probably end up not being charged, as a person has to be warned three times not to come on our property before it is considered trespassing.  Is this correct? It doesn't sound right that we can go up into anyone's home while they are not there and not have broken any laws.\nAnswer: Generally burglary statutes would apply here, but since he doesn't seem to have broken and entered in order to commit a crime, that is actually not illegal.

I'd love to hear from Catholics and preists.  This is not a joke or a public misconception.  It is real and has been a real problem for the church for centuries.  How many lives have been permanently scarred by the pedophile predators that the church recruits, supports, harbors and protects.  Can't the church do something to identify the potential before they allow a prest in?  They need to do something. I won't even get into the church's disgusting and embarassing history of coverup and relocation of prests as a solution.\nAnswer: I watched a great documentary on sexuality and the Catholic Church, and when one particular researcher on the subject was asked that question, he responded as follows. He felt that because no priests are allowed to engage in any sexual act, pedophiles and even homosexuals who have come to believe that their sexual preference is wrong enter the priesthood because they know they can't have sex anyway, so they feel like the priesthood will prevent those feelings from developing. However, as we've seen, that doesn't always provide a solution.\n\nAnswer:",

Now I understand that non smokers would like smoke free places but I dont know any non smokers who wont go into restaurants with a \"smoking section\". I find this very infair and unconstitutional since there was never a time when a buisiness owner couldn't put up a \"no smoking\" sign. This will damage most businesses in NJ gaurenteed. Where could I help speak against this issue and can I find others who feel our civil liberties being stripped from us?\nAnswer: Hi, I live in Georgia and we are already \"smoke free\". We cant smoke in any public building. This means, as you said, restaurants, bars, etc. We aren't allowed to take a lit cigarette in grocery stores, laundry mats or any convient store. Also our work force here is the carpet industry, and most carpet mills run 24 hours, 7 days a week. Alot run swing shifts, which consist of working 12 hour shifts. Now even our mills are saying \"no smoking\" on their property, not even in your own vehicle. If observed doing this you will be terminated. And I'm not even really sure when the voting of these laws were. So I too, would like speak against this issue.

What details and touches would you incorporate?\\n\\nThey are having the ceremony at the reception site.\nAnswer: We planned our wedding, in six weeks, for the week before Christmas.  We also had the ceremony at the reception site.  First, you should see if the site will already be decorating for the holidays.  Ours did and it saved us so much money.  We served Roast Beef and Chicken family style (trays were brought to the tables and people served themselves).  The guys wore silver vests and the girls wore apple red.  Our cake was white with a silver ribbon wrapped around it.  For our wedding favors I purchased 150 small silver bells with hearts on the top that also doubled as placecard holders.  We also had a friend bake us gingerbread men and woman and \"dressed\" them up with tuxes and dresses (using basic frosting).  The bells were perfect for those guests who are obsessed with having the bride and groom kiss every ten seconds!  I think it would be a great idea to do a christmas theme.  It always seems to put people in great spirits and we got some amazing pictures in front of the decorated christmas tree.\n\nAnswer:",

Every night for two weeks, my family was glued to the set to get the updates from the day's events.  We didn't have to watch 8- to 10-hours of coverage to see who won. All we had to do was wait until prime-time and we could see in one hour who the big winners were, and then spend another one or two hours watching a live event.\\n\\nNow, 20 years later, around-the-clock coverage is given on no fewer than 10 stations, not counting the foreign language presentations.  The updates my family got when I was a kid are only given briefly on the fly from one event to another.\\n\\nI feel overwhelmed with all of the coverage. It feels like the covering network has placed that much coverage to fit in all the big-name sponsors and to sell their shows.  Granted, if it weren't for this type of coverage, we wouldn't see some of the more unusual events, like curling, which in the past were treated as more of a side-bar of the games.  But the complete onslaught of the games is a bit much.\n\nAnswer:",

Vicente Fox must be sitting back laughing his butt off over this situation.  Think about it...by encouraging illegal immigration, he has been able to solve one of Mexico's greatest problems; a burgeoning underclass of people who cannot find work.  He exports these people, eliminating a burden on his own weakened government, and in that same token, profits from those who have left as they work here in the US and send money back into the Mexican economy (some figures show that as much as $40B a year goes from illegals back into Mexico).  From Fox's perspective, this is a win-win...he gets rid of undesirables and benefits monetarily from their illegal exodus into the US without having to do anything on his own.  The biggest thing he has to do is maintain a fa\u00e7ade of indignation over the treatment of people he doesn\u2019t give a crap about to begin with.  We need to view this as what it really is\u2026it is an invasion.  Or worse yet, a colonization of the South West under the approval of the Mexican government.\n\nAnswer:",

Many cultures and diversity make it the greatest city in the world. As the saying goes, If you can make it there(NYC), you can make it anywhere.

Merely inserting the CD while running windows will not give you this menu.  \\n\\nMost computers have the ability to boot off cd, but some have this feature disabled.  If you leave the CD in your drive and restart your computer and you get a Press any key to boot from CD message then you're in the clear.  You won't (usually) need to press F6 to add any SCSI controllers and you'll want to do an advanced install, not an upgrade.  From that menu it should give you a screen that lists you partitions and there should be an option to delete the partitions and yes recreate them.  \\n\\nThis is not a trivial task even if you don't have to change your BIOS options to allow CD Booting.  This is not for the faint hearted and while you may want to know how to do this, perhaps it is better that you get someone who has done this to help you through it, like a smart neighbour kid or something.\n\nAnswer:",

Joints deteriorate for several reasons.  Previous injury(fractures, ligament tears, repetitive microtrauma), can also be from diet(eating an inflammatory diet of meats, fried foods and carbohydrates) vs. eating plenty of green vegetables and drinking plenty of water to start.  There is a ton of stuff that contribute toward degerative arthritis, the main thing is lifestyle choices that we choose through out our lives.  Lifestyle choices such as exercise, diet, sleep, mental attitude, keeping all joints healthy and mobile.  If you are interested in keeping your joints from getting worse, I would recommend going to a chiropractor.  They are the only ones who will address joint problems.  They will not give you medications which cover up the symptoms of the joint problems, but actually coach you in a way to better joint function and improve your health.  If you want a quick fix, then there is always pain killers or anti-inflammatory medications but that will only help temporarily until your joints completely deteriorate then its time for surgical replacement.  After surgical replacement you chances are very slim that you will ride again, except around the barrels or around the farm.  Hope this information helped you along.  Want more information you can go to our web site www.yourdynamicwellness.net and that will give you plenty.  Key thing, dont just take a drug or surgery unless you completely know the side effects and outcome.\\nSincerely,\\nDr. Jon Bright\n\nAnswer:",

Do you like work with tools?  people? ideas? \\n\\nIf you do plan on going to college I would focus on what area of education you are interested in rather than what \"career\" as again that can change.  So just do something that interests you or you'd like to learn more about and you will do well!\\n\\nStill it's best to narrow these ideas down by at least Senior year.  Visit a high school counselor and he/she will be more than happy to work with you and help you take career development tests etc.\n\nAnswer:",

When the Da vinci code came out there was a huge uproar in the christian community. People were saying that this was not true and that it could never be true. Why cant it be true, why do you find it offensive? \\n\\nPS: I just want to know, im not anti any religion. I think that if any God indeed had a family it doesnt take away any of his abilities, credibility or taint him in any way.\nAnswer: The primary uproar from the DaVinci Code was that Jesus wasn't the true son of God, but that the church made that up years later.  \\n\\nAs for the rest of it, any time that you take something that has been long established or believed and try to change it, there will be those who resist just because that's \"how it always was.\"\\n\\nI agree with your postscript, by the way.\n\nAnswer:",

My state (New Mexico) is actually very good in what it has to offer.\\n\\nIf your annual income is below $30,000 per year, all medical is covered (including therapies not provided by the schools...in other words...not of issue in accessing the educational environment) through Medicaid. If your income is above $30,000, your work's private insurance may not want to cover \"developmental\" medical and therapy.... check with your employer and the schools about funding supports.\\nALL states must provide the following, per the laws \"Individuals with Disabilities Education Act\" (IDEA) and \"No Child Left Behind Act\" (NCLB).\\n\\n1. Child find -- From birth, state services are offered for therapies, respite care, and family supports (it's difficult to raise a special needs kid), coordinated by a social worker. The focus is to help the family cope with the additional demands of raising a special needs child, and to prepare that child for the school setting.\\n\\n2. At age 3 -- Pre-school for identified kids, provided through the public schools, brings various therapies in (speech, occupational, physical, counseling, etc.), and provides early exposure to academic and life skills training, as well as early training for successful participation in the school environment.\\n\\n3. At age 5 -- Direct educational services at the neighborhood school (except in rare instances, when there is a centralized program that will better benefit the child... for example, I have students transferred from other schools to participate in my gifted education program, another teacher has students transferred in to participate in the behavioral intervention program). This is provided through the concept of \"Least Restrictive Environment,\" in which the primary question is how much of this child's education can be provided effectively in the regular ed classroom? Students are provided with pull-out (part-day programming) or segregated (all-day programming) programs based on their educational needs. The goal is to try to have the child participate with the regular educational community as frequently as possible, with a key components being learning effectiveness and student safety. Students are also provided with various therapies (as noted above in pre-school), assistive technology if needed, and parent education and supports through the special education social worker(s) for the school.\\n\\n4. at age 14 -- Transitional period. Students continue receiving the educational services above, plus the focus starts to change to how the child will live as an adult. A high-school coursework plan is put in place, and it is decided whether the child will work toward a standard diploma (just like the regular education students) or a certificate (for life skills training). Parents are linked to social services for adults as provided by the state and the local/regional community. The child now starts attending the planning sessions, and has a voice in how the committee decides his/her future.\\n\\n5. Age 18 -- unless the parents have extended their custody of the child through the state (usually done for Mentally Retarded or multi-disabled students), the student now has planning control of his/her education. The parent no longer attends the meetings, unless the student directly invites them.\\n\\n6. The year of the student's 22nd birthday -- if the student has not earned a standard diploma, the student \"graduates\" with the certificate indicating participation and learning growth in the individualized program. All services that might still be needed, are provided through state and community organizations, not the schools.\\n\\nIn New Mexico, the state program for severe and profound adults is called the \"Developmentally Delayed Waiver.\" It \"waives\" the person's adult\n\nAnswer:",

The early temperance writers made this assertion and also insisted that the alcohol in their blood could cause \u201cdrunkards\u201d to catch fire and burn aliveThis combustion argument against drinking was dropped long ago but many anti-alcohol writers continue to promote the idea that even moderate drinking causes brain cells to die.\\nScientific medical research has actually demonstrated that the moderate consumption of alcohol is associated with better cognitive (thinking and reasoning) skills and memory than is abstaining from alcohol. Moderate drinking doesn\u2019t kill brain cells but helps the brain function better into old ageOf course, years of alcohol abuse can cause serious neurological damage, including Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome. Harm can be done to message-carrying dendrites on neurons in the cerebellum, a part of the brain involved in learning and physical coordination. But even in such extreme cases, there\u2019s a lack of evidence that alcohol kills brain cellsHowever, abstinence after chronic alcohol abuse enables brains to repair themselves, according to new research involving rats.People who drink too much and are thinking about either reducing or eliminating their drinking should find these findings encouraging, although humans have not yet been tested directly for the positive brain effects\n\nAnswer:",

I love swimming and with summer coming on I would love to go to the pool again.\\n\\nI can have a bath or shower and it doesn't affect me.\\nIs there anything I can take or do so I can go swimming. I have had the problem all my life and I am 52 now\nAnswer: The only option I can think of is buying one of those large backyard pools that you fill up yourself and use your hose to fill it up, since that water doesnt affect you. I am allergic to chlorine so I need antiheistamines whenever I go swimming in a pool, and sometimes even when I drink tap water that hasnt been filtered. I have no problem in the ocean or river though. Rivers are fresh water and are generally cleaner than the water we drink. I cant stand the salt in ocean water and can react to that too though.

However, glass is amorphous having none of the molecular chains found in polymers, which bears the question on what makes glass birefringent?\nAnswer: From my understanding, it should not be, unless subjected to stress, such as bending, which forces molecular orientation.\n\nAnswer:",

I meditated for two months and felt warm now i have mental illness\nAnswer: Asian traditions recognize a number of pitfalls associated with intensive meditation practice, such as altered perceptions that can be frightening, and \"false enlightenment,\" associated with delightful or terrifying visions (Epstein, 1990). Epstein (1990) describes a \"specific mental disorder that the Tibetans call 'sokrlung' (a disorder of the 'life-bearing wind that supports the mind' that can arise as a consequence...of strain[ing] too tightly in an obsessive way to achieve moment-to-moment awareness\" (p. 27). When meditative practices are transplanted into Western contexts, the same problems can occur. Anxiety, dissociation, depersonalization, altered perceptions, agitation, and muscular tension have been observed in western meditation practitioners (Bogart, 1991; Walsh & Roche, 1979). Yet Walsh and Roche (1979) point out that \"such changes are not necessarily pathologic and may reflect in part a heightened sensitivity\" (p. 1086).\n\nAnswer:",

So if you covered its eyes would it still be able to navigate perfectly around obstacles and hunt as efficiently?\nAnswer: bats still use their eyes to see!! They use echolocation to find the precise location of prey...but they use eyes as well.  It may be albe to know where a bug is by the echolocation and then fly to that spot to get it...but would still need to see with it's eyes to grab it.  Bats are not constantly sending out signals...they use their eyes to see the rest of the time.  They send out the signals when they want to feed.  So, if you blindfolded a bat, it would crash into something, and most likely die.\n\nAnswer:",

The \"N\" word should NOT even be in existance any more.\\nI think part of the problem is that there seems to be (correct me if I'm wrong) an attitude in the African American community that it is O.K. for blacks to use this word and to call each other this name (because of the oppression they've faced) but when whites use it, it is obviously not O.K.\\nMy question is why can't we just make the use of this word wrong ALL of the time?  If we don't we only perpetuate this problem.  Example, white boy likes rap, hears the \"N\" word glorified about 40 times in just one song, then your going to tell him not to say this word??\\nAnother example- the word \"groovy\".  It was very popular and cool in the 60's.  Now it is very uncool, and is laughed at in Scooby Doo and Austin Powers flicks.\\nIf we can make this word uncool and not use it in anything it will die. Jackson is right.\nAnswer: Why JUST the \"N\" word?  We \"need\" (please note the quotes) to have words that hurt.  Some people would not be able to speak if they weren't able to deride somebody else in doing so.  Small minds produce small ideas.  The answers lay in the Bible.  IF were were to follow its (God's) word, we would all be treating each other a whole lot better.  God bless.\n\nAnswer:",

There are only two kinds of animal that spend their whole lives performing the tricky balancing act of walking on two legs \u2013 humans and some flightless birds, like ostriches.\\n\\nBalancing can be a deceptively complex business. Nigel Marven joins stunt co-ordinator Marc Cass for a dramatic drive and experiences how the balance organs let us know how we're being yanked around and even turned upside down.\\n\\nHelp from the eyes \\nFor really fine balance, we need our eyes. They help us to work out exactly what the body is doing relative to the outside world. A troupe of acrobats at the Circus School in San Francisco illustrate this when they perform a human tower in darkness.\\n\\nNigel reveals why spinning round in circles makes you dizzy. And, under the guidance of Dr Ros Davies from the National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery, he discovers why drinking alcohol makes it hard to walk in a straight line and can make your head spin.\\n\\nOur sense of balance is so complex that even if all components are working fine \u2013 the balance organs, the feedback from our limbs, and our eyes \u2013 if there there's any disagreement about what's going on, the result can be unpleasant. Dr Frank Golden of the Royal National Lifeboat Institution explains that sea sickness is caused when the central nervous system receives conflicting messages from these three systems.\n\nAnswer:",

The reason I was upset by that is because it was a $20 pacifier that my husband bought online through the L.A. Raiders website.  It is the only one we use for him and I think she should scour her house for it.  She said she looked everywhere and she offered that we could take the one home that he uses at her house.  It's not the same kind though.  How can I express to her that I definately want it found without hurting her feelings or upsetting her?  Can you please give me your honest opinion, thanks.\nAnswer: I understand that this was important to you, but more important than money is the relationship between you and your sister-in-law.  \\nJust take a deep breath and ignore it.

Joe Lynn Turner sings on most of the songs, with the three instrumentals being \"Bite the Bullet\" - a brief intro to \"Riot In the Dungeons\", \"Memories\" - the outro to the whole album, and \"Krakatau\" - a six+ minute piece that contains many themes Yngwie still plays in concert today. The songs are strongly influenced by 1970s prog rock and heavy metal, such as Deep Purple's Machine Head or Emerson Lake and Palmer's Tarkus. .\n\nAnswer:",

Must be.\\n\\nWhile still in the Naval Reserves, and while the Vietnam war was still going, he travelled to Paris to confer with the Viet Cong and North Vietnamese during their negotiations with US reps.

NT books were chosen with an agenda to make Christianity the dominant religion in Rome. If you disagree, why? Please, no vague answers. No, \"Satan spread doubt\" or \"Lies!  All lies!\".  I want to know WHY you do or don't trust the history, and WHY you believe your own opinion.  I'm looking to promote thought, not ignorance.\nAnswer: I have faith that the Bible really was written via the INFLUENCE of the Abrahamic god, but not necessarily at the time it was written. It didn't start being actually put into written text until centuries after the life of Jesus, and therefore MUST have been shared through oral tradition over generations. As that CAN be a reliable source of information, on the other hand, did you ever play \"Telephone\" in elementary school: one person says a sentence or phrase into one person's ear, and that person repeats what they heard to the next person, and than that person repeats it to the next person, and so on, and it never comes out exactly how it started. Maybe Yahweh started the game, and after generations of playing \"Telephone,\" it just got a little mangled.\\n\\nPlus, have you ever tried to translate anything EXACTLY from one language to another? It can't be done: words that exist in some languages don't exist in others, and vice versa; not to mention the varying sentence structure from language to language.\\n\\nThen, of course, the Roman Catholics had to go and alter it for their own control-the-masses power hype, and screwed it up even more. Let's face it: we're human. We\u2019re fallible, and so is the Bible.\n\nAnswer:",

Let me ask you this - how many terrorist attacks have been perpetrated on US soil since we've been in Iraq? Wouldn't you rather be fighting these fleabags over there? And do you realize that our forces, all volunteers by the way, overwhelmingly support the mission that they are fighting? Stop giving comfort to our enemies, and show an undivided front and unwavering support for our people and the mission that they are fighting.

Most common examples are \"Have you no heart?\" or \"Don't you feel pity towards them if you insist on blah-blah-blah?\" or when you're arguing with someone, and that someone starts crying (so you give in). It's a fallacy to use such an argument in a serious, formal debate.\n\nAnswer:",

I'm a registered nurse, and I just found out a few months back that a fellow coworker was on a working visa and is getting paid significantly less than I am.\\n\\nI heard her story, but in my mind I was thinking that's the way it is. Nurses are not cheap, and hospitals are just taking advantage of the situation.  It works for both sides. The immigrant nurse gets to work here and enjoy the freedom, while hospitals can provide competent care to their patients through these immigrant nurses.\\n\\nCommon practice. For the ignorant person who wrote about jobs being taken away from U.S. citizens..can you please read up on the nursing situation in this country. There is a big shortage and no regular Joe Schmoe can do that job. It is going to get worse in ten years. You'll see when your parents reach 70 to 80 years and a nurse is forced to take on 8 patients because there's not enough of them.

He famously vomited on the hallowed Adelaide Oval turf in a WSC game in 1988 before a live nationwide TV audience of millions (he went on to make 122 and win Man Of The Match).\\n\\nMore recently he became the face of Victoria Bitter (VB) beer for its 2005/06 summer advertising campaign, called Boonanza. Part of the promotion was the sale of a talking David Boon figurine with purchases of beer, which would make comments when prompted by Channel Nine commentary. Boon played himself in the television advertisements. This was a controversial choice, as Boon achieved much fame and notoriety for consuming 52 cans of beer on a flight between London and Sydney before the victorious Ashes tour that saw Australia regain the trophy after five years of English dominance. VB denied the story, though chose Boon as a representative (often jokingly referred to as the \"Keg on Legs\") because of his legendary drinking exploits and dogged, iconoclasic batting displays.\\n\\nMore here:\\nhttp://www.thefanatics.com/content.php?id=330\\nhttp://beebo.org/smackerels/david-boon.html\n\nAnswer:",

I could not eat, sleep, and all the joints in my body hurt. That was Monday. Wednesday I started to develope Strep throat and was still dealing with the flu. I did not go to get any meds until thursday but that was just for Strep.  On late thursday night I started to have some cramping pain in my low back on both sides (maybe kidney area). Friday and work I had some very little trouble breathing and still having pain in my sides. I took the meds for strep and pain goes away. I am still having pain in sides and what can someone tell me as to what it might be? I am also having pain in my low abdomen. Is it from flu, strep? What. I don't like going to doctors because most time they don't know what to tell you? Someone please help!!\nAnswer: Hi There\\n\\nPain in the body is the indicator that you have an issue to deal with. Sounds simple, but people don't deal with pain. We are conditioned to take a drug and the pain will disappear, but the actual issue will not. That is what people don't understand (including doctors). Suppression (taking drugs) of any symtom of the body causes it to take the next issue with your body to a bigger problem. Suppress enough headaches, then you have migraines, suppress those and you have a disease, suppress that and you have a cancer, ect. Same story applies for any issue. \\n\\nI have been educating people for years and if you are sick you need to detoxify the body by letting it rest for at least a week. Eat fruits and veggies (live foods) for a week (better yet juice them) and you will feel better before you know it. ALso good to do a colon cleanse because the toxins in the body hang out there and when people dont have regular bowel movements (30 minutes after each meal), the toxins get in the blood and illness and disease occur. \\nYou are probably dehydrated from being sick and that and stress is what causes back pain. Be sure to drink at least a gallon of distilled water a day. More tips please email me.\\n\\nBest of health to you\\n\\nCheers\n\nAnswer:",

Nonverbal gestures, postures and facial expressions by which a person manifests various physical, mental or emotional states, and communicates nonverbally with others.\\n\\nThese messages delivered through nonverbal cues, which can be either verbal or physical, can support, emphasize or contradict what is being conveyed.\\n\\nIn face-to-face selling, Kinesics are often used to emphasize key benefits. But they are particularly important because they can drive important points home -- such as by adding emotion to a sales pitch, which go beyond words.\\n\\nUncrossing of the arms or legs. Raising of the brows. Rubbing of the chin. Leaning forward.

When you wake up but are completely paralyzed and it feels like someone or something is sitting on you keeping you from breathing or speaking.  You also get the strong sense of evil in the room. If so...explain....\nAnswer: sleep paralysis is a throwback from our hunter/gatherer days, caveman days, a long time ago. Back when we where not on top of the food chain and we were not the most powerful preditors. It is a defense mechanism that kept us safe at night. If we were asleep and moved, that would alert preditors out to get us. So our nervous system prevents the body from involuntarily moving while we are most vulnerable, while we are in a deep sleep. It is not supposed to continue when we are conscious but it does happen. If it happens while we are having a bad dream it seems logical to associate the feelings of terror and fear with evil but it is in our minds.\n\nAnswer:",

Its one of those controversial treatments. I don't dispute the fact that it is a life saving treatment. There are honest doctors that can use it to wean you off drugs with it and have great success. The large problem areas are the methadone \"clinics\". Many people go there for treatment expecting a gradual reduction which never comes. Here the cost for methadone is 10-20 per day and either 25 or 50 a month for a counseling session. So they are making too much money off of it. Instead of gradually reducing the amount to get people off of it, they increase the dose as the patients become tolerant of it. There are some private doctors that will do methadone treatment but you really need to discuss it over with several before making a decision. Some of these doctors will try to wean you off of the methadone too fast. You have to find a doctor with a reasonable plan of care. I remember watching HBO a few months ago and there is a special called Methadonia which if you can watch that, they really portray the methadone clinics fairly for the most part. If you do decide to seek treatment at a clinic make sure that your doctor is aware that you are there to quit and not for maintenance therapy! Good luck on trying to help yourself. The type of addiction that requires this type of treatment is a hard journey and congrats on making that decision!\n\nAnswer:",

If they are having a party, usually a money tree is available for placing money gift on.  \\n\\nIf you still would like for them to have a remembrance of you and your gift, why not try a christmas ornament that is engraved with their special wedding day.

Is it better than what I currently have which is a hyper prostaff 6.1 95.\nAnswer: This is really a matter of preferance, they are both good frames.  I have used the Wilson 6.1 classic prostaff for years and it is comparable to the two frames you have listed.  The hyper prostaff will have a slightly larger sweetspot with the larger head size, but I have heard good things about the ncode six-one tour.  Another racket to consider which I have recently played with is the Head liquidmetal prestige red frame.  It has a denser string pattern but suprisingly generates a generous amount of spin.  Actually it took me about 3 days of hitting before i really started liking the Head Prestige, but it was time well spent.  You may want to change to the n-code for no other reason except the hyper prostaff could be discontinued in the near future.  Anyways, good luck with your choice.\n\nAnswer:",

In the Southern Hemisphere is clockwise. This is due to the Coriolis effect, caused when objects (in this case air) moves over the rotating earth. The air flows towards the twister, but curves to right (relative to the direction it is flowing). It is easier to visualize if you think about some air flowing straight north to a twister. Since the earth's surface is moving faster towards the east where it started, it carry on some of the momentum and curve to the east (right of the northerly direction it was flowing). This will tend to cause the air to miss the twister, but he extreme low pressure will allow the higher pressure around it to bend the flow towards the funnel, but the air will have the angular momentum of moving the right as it moves in, thus creating the counter-clockwise twist. In the Southern Hemisphere, a flow from the south towards a twister will be coming from a place closer to the earth's axis, and thus will be moving East more slowly than the land under the twister, so it fall behind (to the West) as it approaches, resulting, through the similar process as described above, in a clockwise twist.\n\nAnswer:",

Use ice breakers just to start talking to people, like when waiting for a meeting to start and there are only a few of you there say something. If you are in a situation where no one knows each other than the best thing to do is to be the first to break the ice - people will think that you are very confident and will then try to rally around you since you took the lead in the conversation.\\nSay hi to someone that you regularly see around - that way the next time you see them you can just start talking instead of having an awkward moment. \\nIf you do know a few people but not that well, then the next time you talk to them and they say something like, \"Oh I have to go now I have a really big test\" (or something of the sort) remember it and ask them about it the next time you see them - it looks you care, pay attention and listen.\\nHope this helps.\n\nAnswer:",

I am starting to become embarassed with the way that I look and I want to get rid of it.  I have done some online research about it but it talks about having surgery or getting pills to shrink it.  Surgery is too expensive and I can't afford it and the pills seem like a gimmick.  \\nIs there anything that I can do to rid mysel of this ugly tumor??  Help\\nI am only 30 and I do not want to have to dress like an old lady.\nAnswer: Que paso Stacy,\\n\\nIm drorganico, natural health practitioner for 12 years and have dealt with several dozens cases like yours and every single one of them, when they client followed every step of the protocol that is, has been cleared up with 6 to 8 weeks of detoxing and making the right adjustments in their lifestyles.\\n\\nAs you said, your 30 and lots of carefree living in front of you so please get a hold of your emotions and forget the old lady analogies, lets get you back to the secure and sexy image that you know you have of yourself. This can be dealt with faster than you can imagine. However I do need to mention that lack of action on your part will make not being able to wear cute little things a very minor issue compared to other complications that will certainly come about.\\n\\nForget surgery and forget additional costly \"toxic legal poison\" known as pharmaceuticals prescribed by docs that realy dont know that there are legit, effective and economic solutions that work in harmony with your body, not against it, Ill give you some basic info and if you cant find a decent natural practitioner in your city, and you want some detailed help, contact me through yahoo, my email is listed.\\n\\nStacey, my business slogan is EDUCATE SO AS NOT TO MEDICATE, so bear with me while I give you some basic information so your informed and at least make informed decisions not just heresay, trendy and gossip decisions.\\n\\nThe fibroid tumor is a hard, benign (noncancerous) tumor that generally occurs in the uterine wall. It usually has no toxic effects on the body and causes problems only if it grows large enough to physically encroach on vital structures. If such tumors are present in the uterus as a woman approaches menopause, they may produce abnormal menstrual bleeding. \\n\\nAt times this bleeding can be controlled only by removing the uterus. In many cases, much less extreme and natural measures are more than satisfactory. The cause of fibroid tumors remains medicaly unproven though there are many solid theories. Researchers in my natural health field believe its due to certain trace mineral deficiencies via an imbalance of the body PH, more on that in bit. \\n\\nThe balance of ovarian hormones must play some part in their formation because as a woman goes through menopause, the fibroids present frequently retrogress and atrophy along with the normal shrinking of the uterus.\\n\\nMany tumors are in the early stages respond well to the use of certain detox protocols and trace mineral supplementation, this in combination of consuming less acid forming foods and more alkaline forming foods and the all important stress management aspect which also plays a factor in why these tumors formed in the fist place since its a know scientifica fact that un managed stress releases a large amount of unnecessary acid in your system.\\n\\nTo accomplish this, I recommedn certain detox herbs, supplements with natural detox agents; essential vitamins that reinforce the immune system, vegetable protein and supplementation. \\n\\nThis combined with spiritual reconnection therapy is effective in virtualy all cases within a time frame of 7 days to get rid of pain, 8 to 12 weeks for the enitre detox process to take hold and at about 12 weeks after the process begins get an ultrasound to confirm what you will already know and feel, the tumor has been flushed out naturaly with no drugs or toxins.\\n\\nNow Stacy, about one of the main root causes of your tumor, PH out of balance. Let me explain.\\n\\nThe body is dominated by 2 chemicals, alkaline and acid, when the acid takes over for a considerable length of time the entire cell structure and tissues are deprived of sufficient oxygen, this is called an \"anaerobic enviroment\" this was discovered by 2 time Nobel Prize winner in science and medicine, Dr. Otto Werberg, a German physician that won those prestigious awards in 1931 and then again 1938, he also documented that once you get the PH to get more alk\n\nAnswer:",

Get all the bad stuff out of the house right away, just toss it or give it away while your still motivated. No alcohol if that applies. Some juice but make sure its all natural, because the ones that aren't are loaded with sugar and a leading cause in diabetes in children and adults. Lots of water, 3-4 liters a day, not all at once, but spread out. Its really easy to down a liter or two while your watching tv or on the computer. Also drink some after you eat the bigger meals of the day, it helps your body pick out the nutrients in food when your food is more spread apart.  These rules may be hard to adapt to at first so start with cutting out the things you know you can live without.  Then work to there.  Remember these are  perfect eating habits, it can take you a while to work into it.  If you know you can\u2019t live without your one treat a day, don\u2019t fight it by trying to eat something else, just eat it and make sure that\u2019s the only one you cheat on a day.  Otherwise you\u2019ll get depressed and quit.\\nAs for exercise, lots of cardio. Find something you like. If you have never exercised much before, start with walking 30 minutes a day at a brisk pace. Move on to different terrains that include hills and increase the time spent. After a week or two, try jogging the route. No matter what find an activity you enjoy. Walking to jogging is just an example, try hiking, rollerblading, biking. Once you get into a regular routine, if your not happy with the level of difficulty, try signing up with a gym. Spinning, pilates or kickboxing classes are great. It will also introduce you to working with weights. Talk to a trainer for instruction before using any weights. A cheap investment is a balance ball, it works you stomach while your just sitting on it, like at your computer and its great for posture. There are hundreds of exercises you can use it for for your entire body. I can give you some ideas if you want, just email me.

I followed my doctors advice regarding tapering off the dose.  I am fine emotionally and mentally, however the extrem neck pain is really upsetting and disrupting my life (I have two young kids, though my bloke does help !).  I know upper neck and jaw pain is a common w/d symptom, I can cope if it is just short term but have tried every legal possible painkiller and it doenst change. this is third day (and night). I can't sleep for the pain.  Can anyone advise. ?\nAnswer: I can only advise from my own experience.  Please tell your doctor that you think you need a muscle relaxant for a little while until this neck pain goes away.  Just ask to take one at bedtime because they might make you drowsy.  \\n\\nSince this is neck and jaw pain, you are probably also a person who grits their teeth at night.  You need to relax.  If you don't mind my suggestions, there are different types of non prescription medications such a Benadryl that you can take at night to help you relax, but I would check with your doctor for a muscle relaxant.  \\n\\nI am so sorry you are having this problem.  It sounds more to me like anxiety than anything else.  Either that, or you may be developing arthritis in your neck in which case you also need something to relax.    \\n\\nBE sure and check with your doctor, this could be more than withdrawal.  I suffered with this until it got so bad, I could not turn my neck at all.  I kept taking Ibuprofen constantly and it did not help at all. Just made me feel funny in the head.  Finally, I found I had arthritis in my neck as well as some spurs that had formed on my neck that were pressing on my nerves.  I was given some medication that helped out a lot and I don't know your names in the UK but your doctor can help you with this.  Do you have chiropractic medicine where you live?  If so, you would benefit greatly from this as well as getting a massage from a licensed masseuse.\\n\\nBest wishes.\n\nAnswer:",

Divorce really should be a last, last, last resort, especially once kids are involved.\\n\\nThat said, there can be a point where more harm comes to the kids with a bitter marriage.  Mom and Dad never get along.  One or both drink too much, are never home, abusive, etc.  \\n\\nKids are fairly resilient.  They recover well so long as both parents remember that through divorce the kids needs are most important.  \\n\\nI'm in a good (not great) marriage.  I could easily get \"lazy\" and neglect my marriage based on this.  (Cheating, withdrawing etc) but the kids need a stable family and my life really isn't all that bad.  (After all, I CHOSE my wife and CHOSE to have kids).  \\n\\nDivorce is NEVER good when kids are involved.  It is a question of which is the worse of two evils:  A less than good marriage with the family working to hold together or a impulsive divorce that destroys kids faith in adults, parents and family.\n\nAnswer:",

I really need help?\nQuestion: I looked up to see if my ex- boyfriend had a warrant for child support. It said he had a civil attachment issued in 2005 what does that mean??? HELP!! Is this a warrant or not? any info will help.\nAnswer: Former police officer/current attorney...working in child support.\\n\\nA civil attachment is similar to an arrest warrant, but then again it isn't.\\n\\nIts probably where the Judge wants to speak with your boyfriend about his child support obligation. Sadly, alot of times you can't get the fathers to voluntarily come in and see the Judge. So, they issue these attachments. More than likely your boyfriend didn't live up to his part of the bargain. I would recommend he get it taken care of...it can turn into a criminal matter. He'll probably have to go before the Judge. The Judge will ask some questions, maybe put some restrictions on him as far as his support. Nothing too serious, but like I said IT CAN turn serious...\\n\\nIts not really a \"criminal charge\", but attachments are usually served by law enforcement. He won't have any criminal record from a civil order. Good luck.\n\nAnswer:",

What can I do?\nQuestion: I met my girl about a year ago, we starting hanging out almost everyday calling each other talking forever even before we started going out. This happened for 6 months and finally I worked up the courage to ask her out. Weve been going out for about a month and a half now, officially, 2 unofficially. Weve had our shares of fights before where she claimed she didnt want to be with me, but she ended up with me the next day, and everything being fine again. But now, we had a fight 3 days ago, where some really harsh things came out of her saying I turned my back on her before and that im scum, a waste of her time, etc. Shes had a pretty harsh past where shes been cheated on, and has cheated on people, and most of her friends have turned their backs on her leaving her to deal with everything herself. During these times, i stuck by her, always taking her side we got so close because she said i was the only person she could trust, i was sincere and sweet.\nAnswer: I answered your previous question about this issue and really wanted to send you an e-mail this time but you dont have that option available.  All I can say is she sounds just like me when I was her age and I know exactly what she is going through.  If you ever set up an e-mail contact get back to me and I will try and explain her to you so you can have a better understanding of what is going on.  Most of what people are writing to you is not right.  I dont think anybody can understand it unless they have been through it themselves.  Good luck.\n\nAnswer:",

I konw traditionally it's the bride's family that pays for the reception and all that... but if you would really like to have a few more of your family members there then I'd say offer to pay and talk to them about it.

This person that told you about the \"basics of Spanish\" doesn't make sense to me =( \\n\\nI guess the 'basics' of a language could be the 500 most used words plus all grammar (however you might define grammar..). Then the rest of the words would be easier to learn. The thing with language is that it's hard to say what is the most important thing to know. If you look at vocabulary and grammar, just one out of these two won't get you very far. I guess for tourists it's most important to know some basic sentence structures with some loose words to fill in (\"Do you know where the [toilet/hotel/museum/restaurant] is?\"). Still, that doesn't mean you know a language. I guess for Italians it would be like that, though. If they knew the basic differences between their own language and the Spanish language, they would probably find Spanish quite easy. This doesn't go for English and Spanish, though. English is a Germanic language, Spanish is a a Romanic language. They are too different.\\n\\nSo.. unless Spanish has some secret code to it, I don't know what the person was thinking.\n\nAnswer:",

We're not together, but we've been playing the role for some time now. I've fallen in love with him and he claims to have strong feelings for me, but I have a lot of insecurities in our friendship. We are currently on summer break in college, but he still lives in the city where we attend school. He begged me to come down and visit him the entire summer, so I finally went last Thursday and stayed until this past Sunday. We had a great time, until I checked his e-mail, which is something I've been doing for a while. Comes to find out, he's sending and getting a lot of messages from females that live in the same dorm as me. I was not at his house when I checked it, but when I did, I quickly called him and told him that I was on my way over there. When I got there, I cursed him out and told him that we could no longer be friends because I heard that he has a lot going on in his life that I wasn't dealing with.\nAnswer: You went through his personal stuff thinking you would find something and YOU DID! First off, going through his stuff is wrong and you are in the wrong for doing so; however, since you know whats up why do you want someone in you life like that? He's not going to be able to trust you and vice versa...it doenst get better from here even if you two agree to be with other, cause even though we forgive we never forget.\\nYou two are just friends, right?  So then you two are allowed to see other people, right?  Technically, he is doing nothing wrong.  If you want more with him then that shouldhave been stated.  The rules needed to out laid down and I'm thinking they weren't, or were maybe unclear.  All in all, why would you want to be with someone who wants to be with other people?  \\nI know exactly what youre going through and honey, it wont get easier cause youll keep finding shit out.  Since you had access to his e-mail, youll try to get access to other things, like his phone, voicemail, any other personal stuff...its not cool to go through his shit cause ultimately you know youre gonna find something.

Thanks\nAnswer: I can't remember seeing a setting in PM 7 to resize toolbars and am not at a computer right now that has it installed but I doubt there is one.\\nMost likely changing the screen size in Display Properties would be the answer (if on a pc that is) but be careful of not going to large or you might not be able to see the OK and Cancel buttons at the bottom of dialog boxes.\n\nAnswer:",

Also, many people these days read the Bible, NKJV (New King James Version) but are unaware that King James changed the text and used it as his own book of laws over his own people. . .Why follow this book, knowing that the original Bible has obviously been altered by additions, omissions and changes?\nAnswer: It is my understanding that:\\n\\nActually, NONE of the gospels are the direct words of Jesus.  They were all written a couple generations after (Luke and Mark weren't even apostles!).\\n\\nThe Gnostic Gospels were not included into the bible because they preach a more self-sufficient version of Christianity, where the person, not the church, is responsible for their relationship with God.  They refer to Christianity in a similar sense as modern buddhism.\\n\\nIt is MY belief (and I emphasize belief, as no one knows for sure) that the gnostic gospels were excluded from the bible because:\\n\\n- They de-emphasize the church...therefore leaving less influenece, power, and control over the religion for the church\\n\\n- They emphasize a more \"inner religion\", where its not about what the religion as a whole wants or believes, but rather the individual person.  This can be deeply fulfilling for an individual, or very unnerving as there would be little unison and coordination in the religion.\\n\\n- They did not properly imply the possibility that Jesus was God.\n\nAnswer:",

Whether you are or not (CA and CO) they are all basically the same. You either have to be a first time homebuyer or not have home ownership interest with in the last three years. The only exceptions to this is 1) if you are purchasing with in a census targeted location with in the state 2) Recently divorced and can produce documentation of the separation. \\n\\nOther areas that you have to be concerned is that there are income and sales price limits for specific locations based on township and/or targeted census locations. \\n\\nThere is a lot more information, but I am not going to post it, but you can either email me if you have any more questions.

It is lawful for any prospective employer or college to view anything anybody PUBLISHES online.  Putting stuff on myspace is not the same as putting it in a private journal.  The Internet is not private.\\n\\n(The following is from the first link I provided):\\nWhile doing so may be in violation of MySpace agreements, little is done to eliminate groups dedicated to the slandering of racial minorities, and bullying remains a problem. Many schools and public libraries in the US and the UK have begun to restrict access to MySpace because it has become \"such a haven for student gossip and malicious comments\"[7]. Some private schools, particularly those with a religious base, have even attempted to ban their pupils from accessing MySpace at home[8].\\n\\nOn November 7, 2005 only 400 out of 3,000 students of Warren High School in San Antonio, Texas showed up after two male students posted that they were going to bring guns to school. The threat was seen by officials and the students were arrested before anything could happen [9]. Such threats are not uncommon on MySpace. There have been many similar, less-publicized situations involving high-school students making threats that tend to be less serious.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe second link talks about some kids that were arrested for something they put on myspace.  It's just another example to maybe share with your kids.\\n\\n\\n\\nGood luck!\n\nAnswer:",

First of all, he still has a good number of Republicans in his corner. Also, some of the gains made by the Democrats were from Conservative Democrats like Lieberman, Casey. Webb, and Tester. When it comes to certain issues, like the war on terror, don't count Bush out as the Republicans along with the conservative Democrats still may be able to prevent the Liberals from waving the white flag and retreat from Iraq, leaving victory to the terrorists.\n\nAnswer:",

Well, I took her to get on birth control just in case and in the meantime I scared the heck out of her, hoping that if she did have sex she would just tell me so I would know and could offer her protection and help her deal with any problems that may come from it. Truth be told, when I took her to the gynocologist, the doctor asked me to leave the room when they examined her and also explained to me that anything she discussed with her or learned was strictly doctor patient confidentiality. I even tried to scare her after the exam by telling her the doctor told me something and she was in big trouble. I tried scaring her needlessly...I think. Bottom line, no the doctor keeps all of that confidential by a law known as HIPPA now and from the doctor patient confidentiality oaths they take. Even if your mom says the doctor told her something, she's only going on suspicion and trying  to scare the truth out of you. If you do decide to have sex, just make sure that you are protected, please. I had to add that....as a mom :o)\n\nAnswer:",

Three cars and a truck had hit each other on the slick over pass of a bridge and all the traffic was at a stop. We were close enough that I could take out my camera and take a photo of the scene. Yes, I know. How morbid but I did it anyway. When I had the film developed the picture had this white, misty thing above on of the cars that had what appeared to be wispy wings moving off the photo edge. I didn\u2019t even know what it was until my friend grabbed my arm and told me that I had a photo of a guardian angel. I was amazed and ever since I\u2019m sure angels exist.\n\nAnswer:",

It's so annoying! When I get my period, I use tampons and tampons only. But, it always leaks and I always have these stupid stains. I'm going on vacation to Washington DC, and I think I'll get it there. Aside from the point that it'll ruin my vacation, I'm also mad because I'm sharing a suite with my mom, my  mom's friend, and my aunt & cousin. What do I do?\nAnswer: To avoid stains you should put on panty liners in your panties while you wear tampons then once it gets full you can change them like you would a regular pad. You should never wear tampons when you are sleeping. You could forget you have it on in the morning or you could have more of a leakage while you're sleep with it on. Always wear pads while you are sleeping. It shouldn't be that bad when you go on your vacation just as long as you take control of your period and make sure that you are doing the right stuff and using the right stuff.

Well, I interviewed an ambitious teacher she is also a charming wife. Mrs. Lana Neville. It was my pleasure to interview her. She was so supportive to answer the question with satisfaction and she was so honest.\\nThe school and how she thinks of it were some categories of the questions that I asked. Mrs. Neville teaches grade one through grade 10. Wow! Most people barely succeed working with one grade. Personally, I really love the way she teaches and impressed of the skills she show us. So I inquired about the amount of years she taught. The answer was 10 years of computer teaching can you imagine how many classes that means? No wonder she has abilities and boundaries she can cross that hopefully we will at the end of this year.\\nThere was some comedy too! When I questioned Mrs. Lana about what she wishes to do this year she mentioned that she wouldn\u2019t want to go insane doing paper work. More over her believed that it would be much better if there was a private computer lab and lunch room for the boys so they would have to stay on the girl's area. On the other hand Mrs. Lana loves the school campus she thinks it is so colorful. Sincerely I think we should keep the campus clean in order to keep our school in a phenomenal look.\\nUnfortunately, there were some negatives in students. Mrs. Neville mentioned that kids don\u2019t listen to instructions and they ask questions. That really bugs her. In addition she said that she is a little bit tougher to the boys then the girls because she has harder time communicating with them. Let's hope that doesn\u2019t happen again for both Mrs. Lana and the boy\u2019s sake. \\nPredictably Mrs. Lana told me that if she wasn\u2019t a computer teacher she would defiantly be a graphic design teacher. There is something I always wondered about computer class. I wondered weather it matters or not if we had Information technology in the first or last periods. It turned out to be that it doesn\u2019t matter. \\nPeople be ware! If you miss behave in class you\u2019ll have a detention. So just keep it quite and don\u2019t bother her. Mrs. Lana says she tries to be friendly with students but in the same time she likes to be strict in order to have good discipline in the classroom. Well Mrs. Lana ended her amazing way of introducing us to the real Mrs. Neville by telling us that she is looking forward for a astonishing year which hopefully will be so enjoyable for all of us.\\nOf course, I had really interesting time learning about this great educator\u2019s life. Let\u2019s all hope the absolute best for her. Hope that all of our expectation for this achievable year is high. Just don\u2019t worry do your best and cravingly we will all succeed in this right path.\nAnswer: I would rate this essay a B.  There were quite a few grammatical errors and essay rule errors as listed below that I would change to bring up the grade:\\n\\nDo not use contraction.  In order change it's to it is, wouldn't to would not, don't to do not, let's to let us, doesn't to does not, wasn't to was not, doesn't to does not, you'll to you all, don't to do not, let's to let us and don't to do not.\\n\\n1st paragraph - 2nd line - ambitious teacher she (change she to who) - charming wife.

The best way to overcome this fear is probly knowing more about how and why people join cults.  Once you know how to avoid being brainwashed you woln't have to fear looking them in the eyes and telling them they are wrong.\n\nAnswer:",

What i cant understand is that while reacting Sodium Carbonate with water it again forms water. How???\nAnswer: Water functions as sort of a catalyst in the reaction. It's very common, and you'll see it happen a lot as you go through chemistry. In this reaction, it donates a hydrogen to produce OH-, which reaction with Na+ to produce NaOH, but then HCO3 forms CO2, meaning that you now have OH- from the HCO3 floating around, and H+ from the original H2O floating around, and they form an ionic bond to create H2O.\n\nAnswer:",

We've been married for 6 years.\nQuestion: I'm a US citizen, he is Venezuelan. We got our interview last year and was approved for a green card pending the security background check. The green card hasn't arrived yet and it has been over a year. I still want him to have a green card, but would we need to stay married until he gets it? Do we need to stay married after he receives it? If so, how long? Thanks for reading.\nAnswer: You are the sponsor, you are petitioning based on marriage: if not married then you can not be the sponsor/petitioner.\\nBut some more details: When did you file for him and was this your first interview? If so, then he was given a conditional status or resident alien. Conditional on you maintaining a true marriage for the next two or three years.\\nIf not married that condition is not statisifed.\\n\\nHOWEVER, if you have been married for 8 years and filed a while ago, then he may already be past the conditional status and can press the petition forward himself.\\n\\nRemember that marriage fraud is a crime and punishbable by a BIG fine and prison time.\n\nAnswer:",

In Oracle9i it's functionality has been extended to include binary reads/write operations. In this article I will demonstrate how to use the UTL_FILE package to perform a simple data extract to a CSV file.\\n\\nIn Oracle8i the UTL_FILE.FOPEN procedure accepted an actual path for the location parameter. Access to the directory was restricted by the UTL_FILE_DIR parameter in the init.ora file. This gave a reduced level of control and required the server to be bounced before changes could take affect. This situation has been improved in Oracle9i where the path has been replaced by a directory object which points to the path. This makes alteration of the path possible without alterations to the code. In addition access control is granted via priviledges which gives a greater degree of control.\n\nAnswer:",

Bush is neither King nor the chosen of God, no matter how often the Republican congress bows before him and he announces to the world that he is the chosen of God. King James had the Bible rewritten to uphold his belief he was the choice of God. George Bush and his appointees are trying to rewrite the US Constituiion.\nAnswer: I will be happier. Definitely. Safer? No. Because of the Bush legacy it will take a long time to show the world that Americans are good people again. Bush's war mongering has caused hatred all over the world and formed a new breed of Anti-American terrorists.

If whatever he is doing is really not acceptable to you and you know you can't live with it, get out.  It may be hard at first but is better than continuing a relationship with someone you know you really can't stand.  On the other hand, make sure that you aren't expecting him to be perfect.  People just aren't, and if it's trivial things that are aggravating but not incredibly so...just deal with it.  \\n\\nIf you told him you'd leave and you continue putting up with him- you have not followed through and he'll never believe you.  Be sure you are really ready to leave and be without him, because (gut feeling) I think you're hoping you'll leave and he will be crawling back- changed for good!  That isn't going to happen.\\n\\n*********************************************\\nAnyone trying to control where you go & who you see is not what you want to get mixed up in!

Its value is strictly as a utilitarian shooter.  Those old Remingtons were often quite accurate and there are still a few old squirrel hunters around who swear by them.

What do I do? is it something to do with my IP address? How do i fix it?\nAnswer: You should have bought a router instead of a switch, the router does network address translation so that both computers can use the internet connection. However not all is lost. You can get away with some software solution. The easiest way is to run a proxy server on the computer that is able to connect to the internet and point the other computer's settings to use this proxy.\\n\\nSearch for free proxy servers such as AnalogX Proxy or 602Software Proxy, they are free and have manuals explaining how to set up internet conection sharing.

What other mammal has this characteristic?\nAnswer: In contrast to most mammals, humans do not have an all-embracing intense hair on their body. Several theories have been advanced to explain the bareness of human body hair. One suggests that nature selected humans for shorter and thinner body hair as part of a set of adaptations including bipedal locomotion and an upright posture. There are several problems with this savanna theory, not least of which is that cursorial hunting is used by (other) animals that do not show any thinning of hair, and that hair similar to chimpanzees and gorillas also shades the skin from radiant heat and protects it from hot winds, and thus another mechanism for heat loss is not required. Another problem is that bipedal locomotion apparently now predates hominids moving from a forest environment to a savanna environment. A more recent theory for human hair loss has to do with a possible period of bipedal wading in a salt marsh in the Danakil region of Ethiopia, possibly occurring in the hominid lineage between 5 and 7 million years ago. As a wading animal, it was more efficient to develop short body hair and a layer of subcutaneous fat for streamlining and insulation in the aquatic environment; the eccrine sweat glands developed later after the hominids left the water; see Aquatic ape hypothesis. One problem with this theory is that both chimpanzees and gorillas have the same density and distribution of the eccrine glands, but that they have not been developed for sweat production.\\n\\nA third theory for the thin body hair on humans proposes that Fisherian runaway sexual selection played a role here (as well as in the selection of long head hair). Possibly this occurred in conjunction with neoteny, with the more juvenile appearing females being selected by males as more desirable; see types of hair and vellus hair. The human female body hair typically has more vellus hair (making the skin appear bare), while the male body typically has more terminal hair (especially on the chest, abdomen and back). Thus sexual selection can explain the sexual dimorphism in human body hair, with the results of selection being more evident (more extreme) in the female than in the male, a point which the other two theories cannot address without proposing substantially different behavior between males and females. Also, we see that artificially bare (shaved, etc.) legs, arms, etc. on women are seen as \"sexy\" even today, while body shaving is not nearly as common for men.\n\nAnswer:",

Cotto is fighting Quintana for the vacant WBA welterweight title. I've heard some smack talking about Cotto whom I think is a fine young fighter with a promising future. If Cotto was willing to drop back down to jr. welter how would he fare against a sheltered Ricky Hatton( I hope Ricky isn't bringing his personal referee Vans and the handpicked English judges to Vegas when he fights Urango) and an extremely respected and tough fighter Jose Luis Castillo? I happen to think Cotto could be one of the better fighters in the jr. welter and welter divisions for years to come. Let's hear some well thought out answers and a little smack talking because I'm ready.\nAnswer: Cotto reminds me a lot of his countryman Tito Trinidad, who like Cotto, is a fine offensive fighter but is lacking defense and gets hit way to much. Cotto has power and power can always bail you out of a tough situation, but his chin is very questionable as he was hurt severely against Corley and Torres. But the man showed a lot of heart in coming back from what looked like sure defeats to win both fights so something has to be said for that. Hatton is a good fighter but i'm not entirely sold on him yet. I think Cotto is the harder puncher of the two and Hatton has an in your chest, pressure style and he would likely trade with Cotto and produce some fireworks. I see a back and fourth battle with both fighters possibly hitting the deck but Cotto landing the harder, more telling blows and stopping Hatton late in the fight.\n\nAnswer:",

In order to solve these equations and make predictions, you need to be good at calculus.\\n\\nIf you limit yourself to addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, you would be stuck with linear models for everything.  This means that any more complicated relationship between two variables could not be modeled continuously, and you would never be able to extrapolate with any confidence.  Thus development of new technology would be strictly trial and error (and you wouldn't even have a good trial and error system without statistics).\\n\\nHang in there!  Get through that math.

I have McAfee Antispyware installed in my system.?\nQuestion: Each time i scan my system for spy and adware, the antispy software always dectect \"ADWARE-NAVIPROMO\". So i configured the antispyware to scan my system each time its idle, but each time it came up with that adware and i delete them all the time, Please i don't know what to do to avoid this adwares from getting to my system.\nAnswer: Adware can be tricky, most likely McAffee is detecting a registry entry it cannot remove. The simplest solution is to install another or even a couple of more anti-adware/anti-spyware programs, these typically wont interfere with one another as do antivirus and firewall products, and usually will simply provide overlapping protection. I would not recommend keeping more than one as memory resident (Meaning that you should only set one antispyware package as providing real-time protection) as this will consume system resources and tend to slow your computer and may cause stability issues.\\n  In order to locate some additional anti-spyware solutions you can do a search in your favorite search engine using the key term \"anti spyware\".\\n Here are a couple of the free offerings:\\nhttp://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=435bfce7-da2b-4a6a-afa4-f7f14e605a0d&DisplayLang=en\\nhttp://www.lavasoft.com/\\nIf niether of those is able to remove the offending item just try a few more, since a large number of them are free all it will cost you is the time you spend installing them, and if you decide you dont like them it isnt difficult to uninstall them.\\n I Hope that helps.\n\nAnswer:",

May have it removed - I was thinking 4 weeks - am office based worker, at home, but need to be mentally 110% - so need to have moved on to plain paracetomol and have stopped dozing off. Many thanks.\nAnswer: If you start out in top physical condition with strong abdominal muscles, recovery from abdominoplasty will be much faster. Some people return to work after two weeks, while others take three or four weeks to rest and recuperate. After surgery, exercise can help you heal better. Even people who have never exercised before should begin an exercise program to reduce swelling, lower the chance of blood clots, and tone muscles. Vigorous exercise, however, should be avoided until you can do it comfortably.\n\nAnswer:",

By the way, Jenson Button will miss that test session because of rib injuries suffered in a karting accident.\\nHamilton has been under Ron's wing for several years and to make a comparison with Michael Andretti and his short-lived Formula One career is just plain silly and without merit, and Andretti isn't the last rookie to race for McLaren; Jan Magnussen started eight and finished 10th at the October 22, Pacific Grand Prix, at Aida, Japan., in his F1 debut. \\nHad Lewis Hamilton been available to just about any other F1 team, he would have been signed long ago.\\nWell done Ron; a good move on your part and there is absolutely no chance that Hamilton will be relegated to test driver status during the season; you can bet the farm on that one.\\nFor `tony h', Indycar (CART at the time) wasn't all ovals in 1993, when Michael Andretti attempted his F1 career; 10 of the 16 races were on road or street courses, including Mid Ohio, Cleveland, Portland, Detroit, Elkhart Lake, Long Beach, Toronto, Vancouver ...\n\nAnswer:",

It could also be a spyware or a hi-jacker. As far as i can remember, i just erased my harddrive completely and reinstalled the factory installed software back. Another problem i encountered was when my desktop computer started to run really slow and i just can't fix it with my anti-virus and anti-spyware software, so what i did was buy a new harddrive (fastest and with more memory) and threw the old one out.\n\nAnswer:",

Although they did not have that strong relationship but I still don't know what to tell my son about his father. He has made no contact with us since then as he thinks that it is for our interest that he gets out of our lives. What do I tell my son in order not to make him feel rejected?\nAnswer: Never been through that - but my dad died when my sisters and I were all very young.  My mom did whatever she could to fill his void (she almost lost her job because she was trying to be both parents at same time --- went to every single game, practice, school thing - took us to parks, vacations - did all she could to keep us busy and to feel loved)\n\nAnswer:",

You can apply to top universities, but I don't know if you can get full tuition because almost (if not 100%), their students got scores over 30.\n\nAnswer:",

If you have YAHOO email, there is a SPAM folder there too.  Nothing to do with a speed upgrade or a router/hub would effect your emails.  It could only be your provider filtering them, or an email setting on your email client.\n\nAnswer:",

Fire BROWN??? why not fire Isiah?!?\nQuestion: LARRY BROWN DID BAD 1 YEAR..HE HAS A PAST THAT INDICATES SUCCESS...YOU HAVE TO LET HIM REBUILD...THE KNICKS WILL BE WORSE NEXT YEAR ISIAH THOMAS WAS A TOOL WHEN HE PLAYED FOR DETROIT..AND THE KNICKS WILL BE WORSE NEXT YEAR THAN THEY WERE THIS YEAR AND I WILL ACTIVELY CHEER AGAINST NY UNTIL ISIAH IS FIRED...\nAnswer: The Knicks has been a bad team mainly because of poor judgement and the pressure to win. Having the highest payroll in the league year after year doesn't always guarenteed victories and playoff berth (teamwork and trust does). The Knicks have a history of giving big contracts that never pans out in the end (see Larry Johnson and Allan Houston) and still have big contracts to deal with no end in sight. Management are making poor decisions on what to do with this team (pulling the trigger on uncecessary trades, bad free agent signing) that results to forcing to trade players with big contracts anaually, but everytime they do that, they inherit another big contract that doesn't pan out. Add to the fact that they don't have a team leader with a heart and soul make the Knicks a discouraging team. Marbury is a good player but not exactly a role model to start with and with Francis on board, this could get even worse. With a bunch of veterans on a team, I expected to see at least one leader that could motivate this team. \\n\\nIt's sad to see Larry Brown being let go like that after one season. Brown has been nothing short of being a great head coach, not only in the NBA, but basketball in general. Everywhere he goes, he has success (UCLA, Kansas, Spurs, Clippers, Pacers, Sixers, Pistons, etc. all either made it into the playoffs or winning a title) and along with Phil Jackson and Pat Riley, has a great philospohy on the game that makes him a sucessful coach. The Knicks never bought into that philosophy, always caring about themselves and how much they should spend rather than learning plays and making an effort to hustle on the court night in and night out. Brown didn't need all this drama and I should have think that he would have retire after he left the Pistons. Again, this was a poor decision made by the Knicks and I'm sure that Brown is going to recover from all of this, but the team is still going to suffer.\\n\\nThe arrival of Isiah Thomas being the new head coach comes as a desperation move by the Knicks to start winning now, rather than rebuilding. Thomas is not exactly a winner's material to start with. He has success mostly as a player for the Pistons (All-Star, Titles) but never translated that success into other ventures he commited (Raptors, CBA, etc.) expect for the Pacers. He has that reputation of being the gentleman in the NBA and I think his name alone is maybe the reason that he's staying in the organization for so long. However, being a nice guy is not going to cut it in the NBA and although his last run as an NBA coach was a success, don't count the Knicks for a sudden turnaround anytime soon.\\n\\nOverall, the Knicks are still popular, namesake wise (Yankees, Dodgers, Cubs, etc.), but the team is still going paying for their mistakes and pretty soon, MSG is not going to be a basketball \"mecca\" that people once knew.\n\nAnswer:",

Something has to doesn't it?\nQuestion: It seems likely that action of some sort is going to take place against Iran.  What type of action ie military, economic, diplomatic etc do you think it will be and who do you think will take it?\nAnswer: I don't see anything happening over Iran too soon.  Any US president would be insane to start a war with Iran and should be sent to a psychiatric facility immediately.  The EU and NATO definitely won't do anything to piss the Iranians off, Iran has missiles that are within range of their countries.  The UN doesnt have the balls to do anything either (plus you have Russia and China who'll oppose a lot on the Security Council).  Frankly, I think Israel is the only one who can be counted on to do anything at all--which in their case is going to be military action.  That, sadly, is going to drag us (the U.S.), if not Europe, in as well.\n\nAnswer:",

Eat 6 small meals a day about every 4 hours. Here what that will do for you, your metabolism will increase (i.e. Loose weight) and you will have  more engry.

I'm 26. so now wi feel a bit better, although weird and not like i was when normal, but i'm thinking i want to do tango again.. maybe not now, but next year or sometime later, . i've seen salsa and other dances and seems they would be worse for my knees, but one time when i first asked the dance teacher \"IS TANGO FOR ME?\" she said \"If you can walk you can do tango\"  NOw after a few months i can walk.. but sometimes it hurts and i limp and feel alot of pain.. soo.. any advice?\nAnswer: Tango's a hard dance - but not because it's hard on the knees.  Unlike some dances, you usually plant your feet solidly on the ground between each step - you're not on your toes much.  You're also not moving at 100 mph, like you can be in Salsa; it's more slow and sensual.  (Well - if you dance tango like they do in some movies like \"The Tango Lesson\", it can be fast, but that's not the rule.)  There are some patterns like dips that may be more stressful, but you can avoid them, since you're leading.  If you're really badly hurt, it still might be too stressful, but I would think it would be better than other dances.  Try a lesson or two.\n\nAnswer:",

We may not understand it at the time, but there is a reason. You have to try and be happy first...as far as the past goes, you can not change that but you can change the future. When you wake up in the morning, say to yourself It is going to be glorious day! Thank God for letting you wake up in the first place.....You have all the reasons in the world to live you have 3 sons who I am sure love you. You are probably feeling this way because you are going through a divorce, but Honey, I have been through 2 myself and I have found someone who treats me the way I should be treated.....it has taken me 35 years, but hey.....Good things come to those who wait.....Continue to see your therapist and look for a job, they are out there.\\nI use to be on depression meds. and I have been off of them now for 10 years...granted, I Still have my moods, but they are not what they use to be, and when I get in one, I try to sing, or read a few funny jokes or talk to a friend or family member.

Is it time for a new deal in Africa to finally end the troubles suffered by the worlds poorest continent\nAnswer: Sigh.  It is frustrating to see though the West might have the best intentions, they still have no idea what is going on in Africa. How will redrawing borders solve any problems at all? It is certainly not borders that are causing the immense amount of poverty and disease that plagues Africa.  Redrawing borders will only cause confusion, especially considering that there are thousands of tribes in Africa: 73 in Zambia alone.  Most African tribes get along swell, and they got along even better before colonialism.  \\n     What Africa needs is not United Nations intervention (Oh God that would be a nightmare), or religion, or democracy (almost, if not all the countries in Africa, are \"democracies\", at least assert that they are), or birth control, or whatever other easy solutions Westerners come up with.They need justice: an equal share of the worlds resources so that they can have money to feed their families, educate their children, and fight the diseases that plague their continent.\\nBut, as Bono says, Westerners are good at charity, they are terrible at justice.

Please help, sorta urgent?\nQuestion: I got a Dell something-or-other, refurbished. I hooked it up to my home network which has a setup like this:\\n\\nInternet <> Router 1 <> ethernet <> Router 2\\nBoth are wireless but I have my main computer connected wirelessly to Router 2 and this Dell one wired to the first. The reason I don't connect to router 1 wirelessly is because it's an unbranded ISP supplied one and router 2, is netgear and has FAr better range.\\n\\nBasically, on router 1, I have a 'network map' of my network. I have Unknown on ethernet port 1 (the netgear router) and also Jack (the main PC). I connected the Dell to ethernet port 2 and it doesn't show it's name, just \"Unknown-00-06-5b-ad-c1-d1\" which I guess is the MAC address. The computer is called Dell and that's what it should show.\\n\\nDo you people have any ideas as I can't share files with it like this which is a nessecity. If I manually set the IP, I can access the internet just not the other PC, and it shows as Unknown-00-06-5b-ad-c1-d1\\n\\nThanks.\nAnswer: yes you dont know what you are talking about #1\\n\\nand if you have PC1 into router 1 via wire\\nand PC2 into router 2 via wireless\\n\\nthey are obviously on two networks. plug PC1 into router 2 and make sure DHCP service is enabled on your router. I am assuming you are talking about those broadband routers that have DHCP service.\\n\\nupdate:\\n\\ntake away router 2 and put everything on router 1. You should be on the same network then, in order to get to that PC you  need to browse via IP unless you have a DNS server or if you are using an additional protocol other than IP\n\nAnswer:",

Who start it. Is there any relationship with Judism\nAnswer: Prophet Mohammad wrote the Quran, the foundation of Islam. Muslim means \"one who submits\" and Islam means \"submission\". These are references to submitting to God and His will. It is related to the Jewish faith in that Muslims believe that there has forever been only one faith. It just gets regular updates from Allah when needed. So ... God sent Prophet Moses. Latter God sent Prophet Jesus. Then God sent Prophet Mohammad. In Islam this represents a steady, unbroken stream of faith. And for what its worth ... Arabic and Aramaic are closely related languages. Aramaic would have been the everyday language Jesus used. The word for God is the same in both. Its Allah.\n\nAnswer:",

Joseph Campbell and Carl Jung are excellent authors to start with. Christians basically believe what every other faith believes. Their way is the only TRUE path to God. In my opinion (as a Christian) that's incredibly narrow-minded. If you've read the Chronicles of Narnia (and if you haven't you should) the last chapter of book 7 \"The last Battle\" has a scene where Aslan (Christ) allows a young man who was a follower of Tash (another god/demon) into the real Narnia (Heaven) because his actions were congruent with the Aslan's teachings even though the young man didn't realize it. Basically I believe that those who are following Christ's spirit or philosophy even if they're not doing so in name have as much if not more truth than most christians.\n\nAnswer:",

What  possible solutions that we can come with to stop it. What cause people fail to be assertive, fail to insist on condom use. fail to negotiate safe sex.\nAnswer: never underestimate the stupidity of large groups of determined people.  All over Africa, the governments have been trying to educate their citizens about HIV.  And for the most part, they are literally laughed at.  In a majority of those nations, women do not have the right to say no to a man, much less demand he use a condom.  And the men simply refuse to believe that they must at the very least practise safe sex, or abstinence...they do not believe they can sicken and die until it actually happens, and sometimes even then, they do not believe that it was having sex that gave them the disease.  Frankly, I think HIV is turning out to be an excellent way of cleaning out the gene pool.\n\nAnswer:",

What that means is that code that is written to make the final software is freely available for modification and reuse - given that you release your modifications to the public.\\n\\nWindows is a line of products released by Microsoft. Unlike Linux, MS does not release the code of there operating system (OS). Windows XP is the latest version of there OS.\\n\\nLinux in its bare-bone format is not easily usable. To be able to use it you need some software that run on it and some drivers to identify your hardware. Normally Linux comes with a lot of software that is developed by under the GNU project by volunteers for the Free Software Foundation. Under this form Linux is called GNU/Linux.\\n\\nSince Linux can be modified a lot of vendors have released their own version of Linux one of those vendors is RedHat. They release Fedora Linux for the public and RedHat Linux for corporate use. It differs from bare bone Linux in that it comes with an installer and several useful utilities and programs developed either under GNU or by Red hat or by other companies mostly under the same license - GPL.\\n\\nSo primarily the difference is that Linux can be modified but Windows can not. But there are several other finer differences. For most people Linux is about choice. Anyway you can read the details here http://www.michaelhorowitz.com/Linux.vs.Windows.html\n\nAnswer:",

So in effect you can never really observe your present thoughts but you can remember the old ones.\nAnswer: This is a very interesting topic. It's like how you can hear yourself say something in your mind, but you don't actually hear sound. Or how you see a certain image when your eyes are open (hence, daydream). It's difficult to observe thoughts as they are happening, since the only way to actually formulate an opinion about what we are thinking is to analyze what we remember thinking. It's pretty amazing how our minds work, and what they control. We can't (more accurately, MOST of us can't) voluntarily control the rate of our heart beat, but we can voluntarily control our breathing. Yet, when we are asleep or not paying attention, our brain's nervous system takes over. It's so amazing...\\n\\nI can go on about this forever! : ) I actually have never heard of the Heisenberg Uncertainty principle but I'll look into it. (After a pause...)

My mother hates them, but she never seems to acknowledge the fact that I have never been in a fight, even when someone hits me.  That has started to change, but only to a self-defence point, and because I had problems with self-esteem.  There is no direct correlation between violent video games and violence in real life.  If you're smart enough to know the difference, they are harmless.  I think children younger than at least 14 shouldn't have access to them, but when I think of the politicians who are using this as political tool to ban them, it is infuriating.  Even if you look at Columbine and the other school shootings, there are so many factors that contributed to wackiness that you can't just single out the fact that they played Doom!  They were abused or neglected, and teased at school.  I was teased too, but I dealt with it better.  Do you know how many guys out there play Doom?  And just how many of them have shot anyone?  It depends on your definition of \"minors\", but banning them completely until you're eighteen is really stupid.\n\nAnswer:",

Odd to answer a question with a question, but think about it. Yes you have friends and family around you that care for and love you. But is there that ONE person, or even just some one a little extra special? You could also just b going through a really tough time right now. And I know that nothing can suck more than having a bad day and coming home to an empty house(and cats don't count as some one to come home to.) If you want to stop feeling alone then don't be alone. Surround yourself with fun and up lifting people. Do a girls night, don't eat alone and don't keep to yourself. You're feeling down, so tell those people who care and I promise they will help. Who know you better than the people that you love and care for? So it's those people who could probably offer the most help and support in a down time for you. We all have those times when we're feeling down, so you're never alone when it comes to feeling down.\n\nAnswer:",

How did all populations of humans advance at the same time?\nQuestion: For approximately 150-200,000 years, humans essentially lived like very smart animals, then fairly suddenly, about 10,000 years ago, we all seemed to have discovered agriculture and \"civilization\"..a few thousand years later we were all writing.  I have never seen a decent, logical explanation for how all the populations of the Earth took this \"great leap forward\" at the same time-After 150-200,000 years, suddenly within about 1% of that time frame, there are cities everywhere from the Middle East, to China, to North and South America?  Writing starting independently everywhere?  For me, this is the most mysterious event in all of history-any ideas?\nAnswer: Hey! Your \"other\" question is already cluttered up with some high voltage discussion and nice arguements so, I thought I should post my answer here as it is more peaceful and calm here. I was wondering whether I should have posted my answer there? \\n\\nNow, I'll try to make sense while talking about a topic that I know little about. \\n\\n1- It all started with the arrival of the first bipedal- Australopithecus anamensis. (some might argue that it was Ardipithecus ramidus). Ok, the point is, as our ancestors started to learn to walk on two feet, they had some challenges to face as bipedalism reduced their speed considerably putting them at a clear disadvantage against their predators.\\nNow, as this problem was faced by all the hominids all over the world at the same time, it led to some parallel thoughts (and thus inventions and discoveries) all over the world e.g. building homes, making weapons and tools etc. (The stone tools were first made by the handy man i.e. Homo habilis and not Australopithecus).\\nThis tool technology was spread by Homo ergaster as they  migrated outside Africa.\\n\\n2- Then, in the course of evolution, the early humans started to have a complex cultural lives and they grew emotionally, e.g. the Neanderthals (who aren't our direct ancestors) started to bury the dead.\\n\\n3- As the homo species like homo erectus, homo neanderthalis, homo heidelbergenesis and ancient homo sapiens (Cro Magnon) made further advances in creativity and productivity, they all felt a natural need to pen down their thoughts. This led to the cave painitngs and carvings. All of those paintings can be interpreted as diary entries as you may see that the paintings and carvings simply depict what the early men \"did\" i.e. hunting, using tools etc.\\nSo, I guess it is understandable why the \"pictorial-scripts\" developed contemporarily to each other.\\n\\n4- But the question still remains: Why were the origin of world's ancient scripts so contemporary to each other? I guess, as man found the pictorial depiction of thoughts and emotions more and more unconvenient and tedious due to the diverseness of thoughts and situations to be depicted, it started taking help of symbols. Perhaps, this behaviour was so \"human-like\" that every sub-species of the homo sapiens followed this pattern of 'depicting thoughts symbolically' universally.\\n\\n5- Another reason of this might be migration. Before the ancient civilizations like Inka, Mesopotamia, Egyptian etc. even came into existence, the early hominids led a nomadic life. According to the \"Out of Africa Hypothesis\", all the modern humans \"Homo Sapiens\" originated from Africa. Later, they migrated to Africa, Asia and Europe and formed groups.\\nSo, I guess due to their similar ancestral origins, the human beings had a common problem solving approach and hence, attempted the problem of inconvenience of pictorial scripts in a nearly identical manner.\\n\\nThe scientific difference in the scripts can explain that they were devised on completely different grounds but, the approach was similar due to common origins and creative grounds.\n\nAnswer:",

It was at that point that every physical property that mattered was at least as good in the white fillings.  HOWEVER - you must be meticulous when placing white fillings.  A poorly placed white filling will have new decay under it within a matter of weeks or months - not years.  If I can not get a good (dry) environment for placing a white filling, I sigh a little bit and go ahead and use a silver filling.\\n\\nAs far as asking how long tooth-colored fillings last, let me say this.  I have been putting white fillings in some back teeth for about 25 years, way before the material was really designed for this application.  Many of those fillings are still there, because I was very cautious about where I did them.  I'd say I was really on the bandwagon by about 1985-1990 and practically every while filling I've done (to my knowledge) is still serving.  That's \"only\" 15-20 years for the oldest ones, but I have only just begun to see some that need replacement because of wear and those that I am replacing are around 20 years old or more.\n\nAnswer:",

Its mostly confined to N America and Austalia but still a little representation would be nice. just a vexing thought\nAnswer: Lacrosse is the fastest growing sport in North America at the high school level. I grew up in Long Island where it was practically religion. I played Division I college ball in Connecticut. After graduating from college, I've played lax in Florida, Michigan, New Mexico, California, Colorado, Utah, Ohio and Arizona, and couldn't believe the level of passion out there. I actually coached a high school team in San Diego with many of the kids just starting as sophmores and juniors... and they picked it up fast from just the beginning of the season to the end. Couldn't imagine what they'd be able to do if they'd started playing in elementary school like people who grew up in my home town.\\n\\nInternationally, as part of the World Games, it has begun to take off, but it takes time. European countries are starting to get the hang of it as are Asian countries... but it's going to take more time.\\n\\nThe other thing is that professional lacrosse hasn't really caught on yet. I'm hoping it can replace hockey as the fourth major as there's so much more scoring (compared to hockey) and no stupid penalties like icing... ;-)\\n\\nWhy not lacrosse? Just like the grassroots spread of the sport in the U.S., just give it some time. But it's getting there...\n\nAnswer:",

One chlamydia infection may not have caused that but it isn't impossible. Other things that can cause lower abdominal pain are cysts, fibroids, endometriosis, etc. You can observe and chart the pain you have and when in your monthly menstrual cycle. If you have it again you need to see a doctor. Mid cycle pain can be ovulation pain which isn't anything to worry about. \\n\\nHope it is only a one time temporary thing, but if it continues you do need to seek medical advice so that you treat it early.\n\nAnswer:",

Verbal contracts are difficult to defend in court, as the argument then becomes one of \"he said, she said\". The best you could hope for would be a resolution through mediation or by judge's order.

When it flowers, the growing tip of the shoot becomes a flowering stem when then supports the fruits. Since the growing part of the shoot can no longer grow (because it was converted into a flowering shoot) the whole shoot dies off after the fruit has been set. The plant itself is mostly underground; it doesn't die but produces more shoots (more \"trees\").\n\nAnswer:",

He is gentle caring funny cute and even innocent.We both are great friends.He often drops me home from university without me asking for it.I threw him a surprise birthday party in a hotel and god i had never seen anybody as happy.he asked me if i was single a few months back.he doesnt call me that often, but my friends keep telling me that he likes me.Does he? how can i know for sure??How do i make him say it if he does?\nAnswer: I reckon he likes you.  Just go for it if you want. Youll know how to approach him. Maybe just hint it to him. Some guys like it when a girl is dominant or straight forward whereas others prefer the girl to be really subtle instead. Itll depend on how he is. But it does sound like he likes you. \\n\\nJust remember, if you are good friends with him, once you go out it all changes and you need to decide if the chance of losing your friendship is more or less important than the chance of a relationship with this guy. Once you go, you cant ever go back (especially once you sleep with a friend, things change forever).\\n\\nGood luck!\\n\\nAll the best ;-)\n\nAnswer:",

We have to educate them, care for them, and put them in prison at our expence with nothing in return you would think they would have the decency to learn the language?\nAnswer: you would think so - dont even get me started on this subject - in my town the mexicans either stand at the gas station in the mornings waiting for someone to pull up in a truck and give them a days work (although, they wont take less than 10/hr UNDER THE TABLE OF COURSE, you have to buy them lunch, and you cannot even communicate to them what you need them to do - or, they stand outside one of the churches waiting for a free meal.  our countrys open door policy not only encourages the laziness of immigrants, but rewards them for it.  BS.  my grandparents came over from the czech republic, italy and poland - they all went to school, learned english and both of my grandfathers became surgeons, pilars of the community.  it isnt immigrants in general that are the problem - and im not saying its all hispanics either - but, if you want to live in this country you should learn to speak the language, educate yourself and your family and give something back to this great nation that took you under its wing.\n\nAnswer:",

I have not taken more than a day off at a time and only due to my car or a sick child.  I had a good relationship with my last manager and felt comfortable asking her anything.  I am a part-time student and have to do 64 directed practice hours for my degree program this spring.  I  have to do it when I am scheduled and it will be my last semester.  It may be in a \"two days here, two days there\" fashion.  This time will be taken as vacation on my part.  I also have the opportunity to go on a week-long cruise in January.  I do/will have the vacation hours/time to do both.  Last month, a new manager came aboard and I feel intimidated to ask for the time to do both situations.  We are on \"production\" and we found out that he is a \"micromanager.\"  Both events may or may not happen in rapid succession.\nAnswer: It sounds like you are due a vacation. Submit your request to your manager in writing. This way your manager does not feel pressured to answer you while you are standing there. In your request, make certain to list the positive things you have done for the company and also indicate that you are due the vacation time\n\nAnswer:",

I already talked to him about my consern and he said that they are just very good friends..they both have my space acounts and every now and then I go into hers just to see if my boy has wrote something to her...a few days ago he send a message and he finish with something like I love you very very much...what should I do..\nAnswer: Well, his message sounds so overtly loving that it really may just be a sister-like friendship.  If you've already talked to him about it to show your care, which is a good thing, how about getting to know the friend better?  After all, if she's like a sister, and you two have been dating that long, it would make sense that he'd want you and the friend to become friends, too.  He probably wants the friend to like you as much as he does and secretly get her approval.  If he gets very uncomfortable with the idea of you and the girl getting close or hanging out, maybe there's something more to worry about.  In the meantime, it might be fun to get to know her.  And honestly, if the three of you are hanging out and then your guy goes home with YOU, you'll feel that little win inside.  Also, he might talk about you to her just as much as he does about her to you, so there's a happy possibility.\n\nAnswer:",

So then I told my brother-in-law that maybe my husband can help him out, better yet could maybe get him a quote from where he works.

That now I got him tied up with the issue of the signs with my brother in law. I told him, \"All your going to do is just a quote\"!! What's the big deal! My husband said that I should of asked him first....that I made a decision that he should of made. I told him that he's just over reacting to something small. I told my husband,\" your not going to do any labor, work in any way, you only going to get him a quote!! I didn't think he would mind.What do you think\nAnswer: You're not going to like this, but I agree with your husband.  My husband works in construction, so there are always people that I know that want a quote or want to get some work done.  I learned to tell the people that I will have to talk to my husband first.  Why?  Because by me suggesting or agreeing on behalf of my husband gives him a task to do, and he feels obligated to do it because it's family or friends.

I live in US.?\nQuestion: I live in New England and am interested in having a permanent spot in Montreal.  Are there real estate agents in US who could help me?  Or is it best to work with a Montreal-based realtor?  What are the pit-falls, and tricky details in all this? Or is it better to rent?\nAnswer: I suggest you find a local (Montreal) agent that deals with international clients.  Call around and find one that works with \"business\" people that live and work in different cities.  It is very common in most large cities for people to do this.  I wouldn't use an agent from New England unless they live part-time in Montreal.\n\nAnswer:",

The big picture is quite wide, so let's focus on a particular property of classical thermodynamics that is challenged by the chaotic behavior of certain systems: the equipartition of energy.\\nClassical thermodynamics tells us that, providing enough time, a system goes to equipartition, i.e. its energy is apportioned in equal parts along all the degrees of freedom. It is well known that the equipartition law has been disproved by quantum mechanics, but until some years ago it was believed a necessary consequence of classical mechanics.\\nThe news is that the recent studies (including my little contribution) have shown that there are certain systems for which, under given conditions, neither classical mechanics prescribe the equipartition of energy.\\nA class of such systems is constituted by the nonlinear Hamiltonian lattices, that is, N-dimensional spring/mass chains with nonlinear springs. To make it simple, consider that some solid gasses have their atoms stuffed in crystals that can be modeled as such lattices.\\nThese systems are classified as chaotic (or also stochastic) for mathematical reasons too complex to be explained here.\\nSuppose you freeze Helium at the point that it solidifies. Then you have such a crystal. Its degrees of freedom are the harmonic modes of oscillation of the crystal (just like the harmonic sounds in a guitar string). From the equipartition law one should expect that, after waiting some time, all harmonics go to the same energy. But this is not the case: most energy remains instead concentrated in the lower harmonics. The effect is stronger as the temperature decreases.\\nObviously these results are mainly obtained thanks to computer simulations, because the involved equations have no analytic solution.\\nSurprisingly, some of these results match with the prediction of quantum mechanics. This is clearly a debated issue but it suggests anyway that the \"old-fashioned\" classical mechanics has still something to say in modern physics!\\n\\nLater addition (in relation to the \"Additional Details\" above): yes, of course I'm speaking of deterministic chaos here, in the mathematical sense (thought it was obvious).\n\nAnswer:",

What can the Michigan defense do to stop or contain Troy Smith? Maybe, take a page from the New England Patriots from a few years ago. They used a 3-4 defense that constantly rotated it's coverage package. Could this work against OSU?\nAnswer: Wow-ask a question like this and you really pull out all the over confident OSU fans.  As my husband likes to say-You can't ever look past any game or team in the big ten.  With classic rivalries such as OSU/Michigan, you can look at stats and rankings but it truly means nothing when these two teams play.  While OSU has had a great offense this year, their offense was crushed last weekend when Illinois found the holes in their line.  And that was a team that doesn't have the #2, questionably the best defense in the country.  If the wolverines can contain Troy Smith and Ted Ginn's run game, which I think they can, Michigan will win.  Neither team will play next weekend like they did last weekend and it always proves to be a great game.\n\nAnswer:",

She has become very self-centered. For example she interrupts EVERYONE who is talking to talk about herself. Once she interrupted one friend\u2019s story to tell all how she straitened her hair. The story didn\u2019t go anywhere and everyone was left confused. Another example is at her birthday party she rapidly opened one gift and then tossed it aside without saying thank you. Then screamed \u201cMore\u201d and held out her hands. She also has become so boy obsessed that it interferes with her normal life. For example she follows one boy around school constantly. She even stole his favorite jacket. My other friends have also noticed the dramatic changes in her too. I want to salvage our friendship but she seems too far gone. Do you think it is worth it? Do you think she can really change?\nAnswer: give it a try. it's worth that much. brace yourself though. it does sound like she's far gone. tell her what you feel. she might blow you off but that will make it easier for you to move on. \\n\\ngood luck.\n\nAnswer:",

Lemoore, California.  Lemoore has highest ratio of made 3 point shots in central section, Alex has highest ratio at Lemoore High School.  5'9\" 160lbs.  3.5gpa\nAnswer: Believe it or not, the coaches usually come to you -- early.  I know a 15-year-old, 6'3\" high school basketball star who started receiving letters from universities as a freshman.  This was before he was invited to join the varsity basketball team as a freshman.  In short, Big Ten university coaches have been courting him and his parents since he was 14.\\n\\nSince your star has not been approached at this point, you must take matter into your own hands.  Despite the height factor, treat your star like a product.  Become your own Arliss or Jerry Maguire, i.e., sports agent.  Look at the college sports pages for top twenty lists to map out your target schools.  Assemble a media kit with the newspaper clippings, high school transcripts, a personal essay, letters of recommendation from faculty and community leaders, and action photographs of your star.  Pitch your star to the head coach and assistant coaches.  If they require more information, offer to send them a media kit.  Request an interview.  If possible try to bring your star to meet the coach if his/her team is playing at a nearby university.  Send a thank you note.\\n\\nIf that does not work, network, network, network ... Cultivate relationships with the sports writers at your local and big city newspapers and the sports anchors of your local television networks.  Ask for help.  Then ask for recommendations.  For the most part, if your star is not on the front page of the sports section, then you must be aggressive in gaining coverage.  \\n\\nAdditional keys to boosting the profile of your star are park districts, regional tournaments, traveling teams, basketball festivals, and summer camps.  The more people know about the talents of your star, the better.  It may sound overwhelming (and expensive), but practice and multiple performance venues make perfect public relations for budding NCAA stars.  If your star has not been playing basketball year-round, since kintergarten, then expedite your media campaign -- yesterday.\\n\\nIf your star is really a star, then a scholarship is in your reach.  So, roll up your sleeves and claim it.  Ask the basketball coach, athletic director, principal and teachers for support in your endeavor because the universities will confirm your information.\\n\\nAgain, year-round participation is of vital importance.  So, research leagues outside of high school.\\n\\nHave a grateful day.\n\nAnswer:",

We have a 7 month old boy and i do take care of all the finacial responsibilities.  She does not want me to take the child to my apartment during the times that I am there.  We live 5 minutes apart.  She says the baby is too young, and I should wait till he's one.  She however does not stop me from coming to her place to spend time with the baby.  I wanted to go to the court, but they said we have to divorce for any court ordered stuff.  Don't get me wrong, she is not a bad mother and i am not a bad father, we are just going through so stuff.  I am stuck between my duties of being an African (as in wait), or my American side (get a divorce, get your child, which i can win custody due to what she is doing).

Why can't it be fixed?  You obviously loved her before, right?

The database would contain thousands of objects with pictures and information on the objects. I understand MySQL is a free and good database? As stated I have no programming or webpublishing experience but don't mind spending some time on it as long as it doesn't take me months to get up & running. Any help would be very much appreciated.\nAnswer: The best and cheapest way is to sign up for a webhosting account and buy a domain name for your site. I personally recommend nfshost.com for it. They have PHP, CGI, MySQL and lots more pre-installed. Then you have to learn PHP and MySQL and write a CMS. Depending on your current status of knowledge in these subjects, it can take about a month or two to go online. Alternatively you may use some of the readymade CMS's available online for free.

Norris asked if anyone would care to step up and spar with him, and like THE DINGLE-BERRY DUMB-ASS he is, my husband, in a moment of sheer stupidity said he would. Well he goes up to Chuck Norris, they do they're bow and then Tony, my husband, kicks Chuck Norris right in the face. And before Tony had a chance to even realize what he'd done, Norris layed him out. And I mean LAYED HIM OUT!!!!! Tony said the last thing he remembers is seeing that big foot coming at him at what seemed like light speed and then looking up at the ceiling.\\nTrue Story, no joke!\\nIs my man not a big DUMB goof-ball or what?\\nAnd what made it worse, when Tony returned back to the class, the next day, the instructor conned Tony into sparring with his 9 year old daughter and she wopped his butt, too!\\nLMAO\\nBut in his defense the little had been taking Karate since she was about 3 or 4 so, she was way more advanced than him, and in so many ways, lol!\n\nAnswer:",

At my high school (Bakersfield Christian High School, Bakersfield, CA), I learned three things this year: 1) get to know people because the people you may hang out with might be famous one day [a.k.a. make yourself available], 2) manage your time wisely; don't procrastinate or the homework today will nip you in the butt tomorrow & 3) get active in school activites.  Don't be a loner that's againist the world.  Participate in activities that you love, may it be sports, drama, music, etc.  Just go out there and give it your all, because you only have 4 years to make a name for yourself...\n\nAnswer:",

I'm not sure if it was the right thing to say but words to that effect need to be said and it worked out in the end. What holds me back now is the possibility of rejection and heartbreak.

If you want to use the entire 10GB disc space for Win 98 it would be best to reformat the Hard Drive and then reinstall the Win 98 OS. You can download a \"Boot Disk\" for any operating system from \"Bootdisk.com\" or create one from the Win 98 CD. Be sure you have all the Drivers for your hardware; mouse, video card, CD-R/RW, etc.\\n\\nSorry, but you will have to reinstall everything.

Assess the current diet and identify where improvements should be made and commit to those improvements. \\nreduce toxin intake - obviously tobacco, alcohol especially - they might seem to provide temporary relief but they are working against the balance of the body and contributing to stress susceptibility, and therefore increasing stress itself. \\ntake more exercise - generally, and at times when feeling very stressed - exercise burns up adrenaline and produces helpful chemicals and positive feelings. \\nstressed people must try to be detached, step back, look from the outside at the issues that cause the stress. \\ndon't try to control things that are uncontrollable - instead adjust response, adapt. \\nshare worries - talk to someone else - off-load, loneliness is a big ally of stress, so sharing the burden is essential. \\nincrease self-awareness of personal moods and feelings - anticipate and take steps to avoid stress build-up before it becomes more serious. \\nexplore and use relaxation methods - they do work if given a chance - yoga, meditation, self-hypnosis, massage, a breath of fresh air, anything that works and can be done in the particular situation.\n\nAnswer:",

Here's some info.\\n\\nFlatland is a BMX riding style that is performed on smooth flat surfaces, often with flatland specific frames, front & rear bolt on axle pegs, a hollow stem bolt for the front brake cable, and rear brake detangler or \"gyro\" to facilitate the bars being able to rotate endlessy without tangling the brake cables. Also invented specifically for flatland bmx riding was the rear hub mechanism called a \"freecoaster\", that allows the rear wheel to roll backwards without engaging the hub to make the pedals rotate around. Other technical bicycle setup specifics can include narrow handlebars, rear hand brakes and a Gyro rear brake cable detangler device, very high pressure tires, and a very small front sprocket. But in concept, any BMX bike with axle pegs could be used for flatland riding.\\n\\nIn a contest, your talent and skill is judged by your ability to maintain coordination and balance while performing a variety of difficult and elegant moves. There are usually several categories for judging purposes which can include:\\n\\nnumber of touches, i.e. = the number of times a rider does not complete their trick and/or touches their foot to the ground \\nnumber of tricks completed in the alloted time \\ndifficulty of the tricks; which can be very subjective, as flatland bmx has become as (if not, more) technical in many ways as figure skating and breakdancing \\noriginality of the tricks performed; which again is fairly subjective \\nstyle and flow; which means how smooth and/or stylish did the rider perform their moves during the contest run. \\nFlatland is an involving, time-consuming discipline where the rider learns different balance, counter-balance points and center-of-gravity in motion through repetition and trial-and-error. Some tricks can be learned in hours, others may take years to achieve.\\n\\nSome flatland riders would refer to flatland as a type of art, and would place the emphasis on being original, while others consider having the most or hardest tricks the important thing, and still others ride just for fun. There is no right or wrong, and only contest riders need to be concerned with the competitive side of things, as there are many riders who prefer doing shows, having parts in videos, or simply riding with their friends and enjoying themselves as much as winning a contest.\\n\\nRiders usually pedal a few times for speed, and perform various stunts often involving difficult and/or awkward stances on pegs, mounted to the axle of their front or back wheels. Pegs are hollow metal tubes, which are bolted onto both sides of the front and back axles. When flatland riding first came into being, most riders would do one trick, and then get back to the pedals and that was it, but by combining different body, and bicycle positions, into \"combos\" and \"linking\" them together, riders challenge themselves further by doing several tricks in a row without stopping inbetween each move. Flatland riding is usually a combination of many different kinds of moves, often linked together in a non-stop fashion as the rider goes through as few as 2 or 3, or as many as 10-12 moves, and position or direction changes in a row, and then finally returning their feet to the pedals. It has been somewhat unelegantly compared to both ice skating, and breakdancing, and really, it is its own thing, but those comparisons will give you a vague idea of what to expect to see.\\n\\nNotable flatland BMX legends include Bob Haro,Kevin Jones, Chase Gouin, Ross Smith, Bill Neumann, Pete Brandt, Jesse Puente, Chad Degroot, Andrew Faris and Trevor Meyer. Modern flatland legends that have influenced other riders include Simon O'Brien, Martti Kuoppa, Mat Wilhelm, Phil Dolan, Lee Musselwhite, Jeff Desroche, Cory Fester, Percy Marshall, Stephan Cerra, Terry Adams, and Tanaka Kotaro.\\n\\nStall moves were among the first flatland tricks invented, they require good control o\n\nAnswer:",

There is a difference between the world hating you for His sake, and hating you because you talk the talk. \\n\\n\\nI say this for the unbelievers- God isn't saying follow the \"Christian\" guy or gal you work with or live next door to etc..

They have also been twitching.  I read that this could be a sign of MS.  I have a doctor appointment soon but, was wondering if anyone could give me any more details.  Thank you.\nAnswer: Spasticity is like a \u201cwicked charley horse.\u201d  Brain injury from stroke sometimes causes muscles to involuntarily contract (shorten or flex) when you try to move your limb, creating stiffness and tightness.\\n\\nWhen a muscle can't complete its full range of motion, the tendons and soft tissue surrounding it can become tight.  This makes stretching the muscle much more difficult.   If left untreated, the muscle can freeze permanently into an abnormal and often painful position.Spasticity in the leg may cause a stiff knee, pointed foot and curling of the toes\\nyou should go to the doctor and get their opinion.. check web md. with your symptoms too..\n\nAnswer:",

It's believed that the parts of their brains that register visual information remain dormant. \\nAccording to this fascinating article by Diego Kaski in the International Medical Students' Journal, even people who lose their sight early in childhood retain visual imagery in their dreams well into adulthood. However, this imagery fades over time. \\n\\nNevertheless, blind people do dream and often describe their dreams in terms of places and surroundings. An article from the University of Santa Cruz notes that blind dreams feature a \"very high percentage of gustatory, olfactory, and tactual sensory references,\" something very unusual for sighted dreamers to experience. \\n\\nFor some intriguing and descriptive quotes on the subject, read Richard Catlett Wilkerson's article \"Dreams of the Blind.\"\n\nAnswer:",

If you are not interested, say so.  If you are still wanting to play the field, say so. These things can cut down on un-needed heartbreak later which will just lead to anger. It is mis-leading- and it leads people on.  If you are seeing other guys, just say so- we will deal with it by either accepting it or leaving, but if you are honest about it from the very beginning, we wont be angry for being lied to or led on.\\n\\nMy question is; why do you feel the need to be dishonest?\nAnswer: did you think you would get an honest answer? If so, how could you expect that when you already think women are liars?\\n\\nI disagree with the payback philosophy though, because at the most it is a 50/50 thing- guys lie 99% more than women?  Thats a laugh to say the least!\\n\\nI have found that women are liars too, basically because I dont lie to them.  So I think what happenes is that ONE person in the relationship is a liar that why theres problems, otherwise if both were liars, it would probably work!  I know men that lie to their women too, so I dont just think women are liars- and in those cases it is the women that are honest.\\n\\nSomething else to consider, and ladies, you are not qualified to respond to what I am about to say here- because you will either never admit it, or you dont see it in yourselves;  women want you to read their minds. They will tell you something with absolutely no details, but then expect you to be ABLE to recall those details later.  You may be able to recall the whole conversation, but she will tell you she told you something else, and if there is one detail you dont remember (because she didnt tell you) she will say \"you never listen to me!\" The fact is we listen, but what they say to us means something else to them than it does to us.  Thats why it seems like they are ALWAYS lying, because when they say things, they dont mean them in the way that plain english defines them.\n\nAnswer:",

PLEASE DONT TAKE PILLS... pills are nothing but anorectic agents... they make you feel less hungry... there is no way to loose weight fast... though , sauna , steam and massages help slightly... it has to be combined with diet and excercise... pills are very bad in the long run... can lead to impotency and infertility...\\n\\nAlso... short term diets are no good because , they terribly pull down your body metabolism rate since you dont eat much during that period ... Because of this , once you break your diet , you'll start putting on more weight, the reduced body metabolism will take longer and slower to burn the food you take in...\\n\\nThey also dont work because once you break your diet and start eating normally, you will get back to your normal weight as you might not be cautious as to how many cals you take in per day...\\n\\n\\ni lost 10 kgs in about 5 months time... i am getting married in august and i desperately needed to loose weight... i was 65 kilos when i started... according to my BMI , i was 10kgs + overweight... i stand 5'2.odd and 65 kilos is grossly overweight...\\n\\njust dieting wont help like i found out in my case... diet + exercise will do the trick...\\n\\ni'll tell you what i did... it worked for me... hope it works for you too :)\\n\\nthe trick is not to starve but to eat smart :) and stay healthy :)\\n\\nwhat you should cut down :\\noil , butter , cheese , margarine , mayonisse , sauces (depends , will get back to that a bit later), chips , crisps, nuts , chocolates , sugar , cola, fizz , areated drinks ,ice creams , chocolate , alcohol , cakes and everything else thats hi - cal... you'll need to avoid everything thats sweet , oily and sticky... if you are not sure about what foods to avoid... check the net...loads of info available...\\n\\nvegetables / meat to avoid :\\npotatoes - very very important , beetroot (its a root and has concenterated sugar in it) , all kinds of roots basically except carrot... avoid lamb, mutton , pork , beef, and prawns... all these put on weight... eat only lean meats... thats fish and chicken.. avoid eating egg yolk... eat just the egg white...\\n\\nfruits to avoid :\\nmangoes , bananas , jackfruit\\n\\n\\nnow that we had a look at what foodstuff is to be avoided...you might be wondering if there is anythig at all that you can eat... thats how i felt... there is loads of stuff you can eat actually :)\\n\\nhere they come :)\\n\\nfast foods are a big no no... you can order salads and special lo cal foods that are avaailable in most outlets...\\n\\nits best to eat at home for the period you are dieting and trying to lose weight...after those few months... once you've shed your load...you can get back to your usual lifestyle... of course with some caution...\\n\\n\\nmy diet...\\nbreakfast:\\n\\nskimmed milk (use skimmmed milk , is low in fat , other typer of milk are higher in fat content) , fruit... i am from India... am not sure where you are from and hence you might not understand certain food types we consume here... but let me tell you something...

No long ago, two Egyptians were trying to enter the country from Mexico, with Mexican documents, but didn't speak any Spanish.

What's a good one for this...?\nQuestion: My girlfriend just got some new friends. I was trying to tell her they are the kind of people that aren't really friends. They are the kind of people that just want to have fun with you. They don't really care about your problems or sympatheize with you. All she does with them is party. I can already see them changing her. She is cussing more, drinking too much, and she tried smoking a cigarette and she doesn't even smoke. It seems like she is loosing some of her morals too. The only true friends she probably has moved away a long time ago and has a busy life so she almost never gets to talk with her. She considers them all the same. I was looking for a movie that shows what friends like this really are like, how they are nothing but trouble and will only bring you down. Maybe just a movie that has this in it and not one that is only about this. Or how can I get her to see what these people are really like???\nAnswer: hey do you think that movie your looking for will change her?\n\nAnswer:",

In English, negro or neger became negar and finally nigger, most likely under influence of French n\u00e8gre. Neger (sometimes spelled \"neggar\") prevailed in northern New York under the Dutch and also in Philadelphia, in its Moravian and Pennsylvania Dutch communities. For example, the New York City African Burial Ground was originally known as \"Begraaf Plaats van de Neger.\\n\\n\"Nigger is an extremely derogatory term used for black people. During the period when slavery was practiced worldwide, and in particular by the United States and European countries, and for several decades after Europe and North America prohibited slavery, it was a standard, casual English term for black people. The word traditionally has been associated with an often casual contempt, a racist assumption of black inherent inferiority, even of bestiality, making it extremely pejorative. In the last 100 years it has also become a friendly and jocular term, used self referentially, among some black people.\n\nAnswer:",

Why do they get more attention than women sports?\nAnswer: I am not sexist in any way, so dont think I am. The caliber of mens play compared to women is much higher. In some sports women do step up and get a chance to play in mens leagues, but usually end up giving up on that. In the sports that women played against men, such as hockey, with the tampa bay goaltender, she made the NHL, played one game and got smoked, she never tried to go back. Men have a more competitive nature and the body to back it up. Women are usually not built to be a big football or hockey player.  But some of them do what they can to get to the level they can play with the men. I dont know if they are trying to prove something or what. But the reason men sports are more popular is because more men watch sports than women. And a lot more men play sports then women, men are dominant in sports. Women do not get into sports as much. And there are also a lot of sexist guys out there that feel women should not play sports, which i think is ridiculous.\n\nAnswer:",

I liked the whole comment about having a lack of tension. I may be wrong, but I think the guy's from Iran. Don't they kind of have a habit of ignoring the international community and causing just a wee bit of tension on the rest of the PLANET? Besides, he underestimates the intellect of the American people; we are perfectly used to political rhetoric trying to play our emotions off of current events so that we form a favorable opinion to their cause(in this case namely \"destroying the Zionist Jews\") I hope he doesn't plan his reelection on it. Oh ya, if he gets thrown out, he'll just kill who he has to in order to get back.\n\nAnswer:",

This guy was even into drugs at the time. I on the other hand was polite and kind to her. My friend also knows this one guy thats the same way, and he gets tons of girls.

The advantage to this is that everything works smoothly and orderly and people that aren't really bright and have no ambition can handle living there.\\n\\nPC is like living in a mansion on a large estate where anything you say goes.  You are free to do stupid as well as smart things.  You can let your grass grow tall and turn your stereo up all the way.  People (programmers) from all over the world give you stuff for free.\\n\\nIn other words, the Mac is for simple minded people that can't figure out how to operate a PC.\n\nAnswer:",

(Please answer and read the question below)?\nQuestion: WHat is the difference between light dispersion, light refraction, light diffraction, and light reflection? What is another property besides diffraction, dispersion, refraction, and reflection? Please give a scientific answer.\nAnswer: All these produce a change in path of incident ray of light but reasons and effects are different in each:\\n\\nDiffraction -- bending of light round the edges and corners, while passing through slits/holes/wires in the same medium. produces a pattern of alternate bands/fringes ( minimum/maximum intensity). they are maximum intense at the center of the path and fades of - on both the sides\\nshape of bands/fringes depends on the shape of obstacle(hole/slit/wire/edge)\\n\\nRefraction -  bending of light , when it passes from one medium to another of a different refractive index, no pattern produced. no change in the intensity if the second medium does not reflect/absorb part of incident light.\\n\\nReflection: Change of path of light ray due to reflection, i.e the reflected ray is in the same medium as the second medium simply does neither absorbs nor allows it to pass through it. No change in the intensity and no pattern produced.\\n\\ndispersion -  splitting of incident lightray into its constituent wavelengths, when it passes through a medium (like prism). every wavelength gets deviated from incident path through a different angle (angle of dispersion), hence you can see different colors of visible light.\n\nAnswer:",

It is really two programs-one on your computer (\"server\") and the other on the cracker's (\"client\"). This server runs automatically every time the computer is started. A Trojan program gives the cracker complete access to your computer. There are thousands of different Trojan programs.  Trojans need user intervention to install (the file needs to be opened) and do not self-replicate like viruses.\n\nAnswer:",

I'm down to  7.5 mgs for the next three months. What has your experience on Prednisone been like?\nAnswer: It's a great drug for a variety of problems. However, it suppresses the normal adrenal cortex. This is why it's critical to ween from the drug slowly, to allow the adrenals to start functioning again. Follow your doctor's directions explicitly. It's dangerous to try a shortcut.\n\nAnswer:",

I want my father to agree for our nmarriage as v both r very serious about getting married. His parents have already said yes for our marriage. In my family also my all the relatives have said yes i mean they dont have any objection related to our marriage but my father is bit caste conscious person i want him to get agreed for the marriage i really need a good advice from you all who will be answering my this question.\nAnswer: You need to make your father understand that love can come in any age, size, look,etc. If your father doesn't accept the two of you getting married, than in a way that's his own problem. Your 19 years old, legally grown, meaning that you can do what ever you want to do. Maybe he might see it differently when you turn 21, so if you love him that much just wait a couple of years when your father may see it differently.\n\nAnswer:",

Dubai is a GOVERNMENT RUN company.  And the government that owns it has allowed Al Queda to launder money through their country, in essence, funding terrorism against the United States of America.

But there is hope. Internet radio is gaining popularity daily with the general public partly because listeners know they can listen to independent artists that commercial radio refuses to play. And Internet radio is probably where you should start. \\nI'm assuming you have the finished product. If you have an mp3 of your song(s), then register with Myspace as an artist. Upload your songs and then search for record labels, broadcasters, bands and regular members to listen to your songs.\\nIf a broadcaster likes it, they'll pick it for rotation. How do I know this? I'm an Internet radio broadcaster and I review and play quality independent artist's music.\\nIf it's really popular with the Internet community, I think it'll eventually make it to commercial radio.\n\nAnswer:",

Why the sky is blue.\\nWhen light passes through a medium with molecules much smaller than the wavelength, it is scattered. You can understand it so: the light begins by going as a beam \"forward\". It gets absorbed for a moment by a molecule and then emitted again in whatever direction. This effect is more effective when the wavelength is shorter. Blue light has a wavelength ~2 times shorter than red light and gets scattered 16 times as effectively. So the beam coming directly from the sun is deprived of blue =>thus it is yellow (or red if it is sunset and it has passed a thick layer of atmosphere (geometry)). From all other directions we see the light that was going towards other points on the Earth. The yellows and reds went on and the blue was sent in other directions, including towards us.\\n\\n2. Why the grass is green.\\nGreen plants use light to make food. The light is absorbed by chlorophyll (two types of it, too and a bit different, but no matter). Chlorophyll absorbs violet, blue, orange and red light. What we see is what was not absorbed, but reflected. If you take the aforementioned colours out of the white light spectrum, you get a mixtureof green and yellow. And green is the colour our eyes see best. Thus - green grass.\\n\\nI hope I've been clear\n\nAnswer:",

Okay, I worked out every week at least 3-4 times a week for a straight hour, and I would walk uphill at the highest incline at 4.3 miles an hr on the treadmill.  This went well, I burned 700 something cals an hour and combined with eating healthy, I managed to get from 130 in July to like 112 or so in early Nov.  Now I realized that my heart rate was NOT high at all- it was barely more than a resting rate! So I started running in the beginning of Nov (this month) and since then (Its been what, three weeks?) I have noticed MAJOR changes in my body.  I am suddenly a LOT slimmer, and have all this extra skin around my stomach from where I obviously just lost fat.  WHY?  Why so quick? Does it have to do with the heart rate? Its weird because I am burning less calories now- I run on the treadmill at a good steady pace of 5.6-6.5 miles an hour for about 30-40 min 5 times a week. But why did these physical changes just start showing up? My diet is good....\nAnswer: the calorie count on the machine may not be accurate.....if your heart rate is higher, you are likely burning more calories\\n\\nalso, you may have built up some muscle, which takes a little time......if this is the case, you should be burning more calories all day and night, and this will definitely speed up weight loss......\\n\\nalso, since you have less weight to lose, any loss will be a lot more obvious.....you may just lose a couple of pounds, and notice a big change, where before you wouldn't have noticed any just from losing that amount.........\n\nAnswer:",

Look at an exercise table and it will tell you how long you have to do a given activity to burn so many calories.  A small portion of ice cream probably has 200 calories, which you would have ro run for say a couple of hours for to burn.  Exercise is good, dieting is better, and both is best.\n\nAnswer:",

I am not sure as to his fitness to run a country but I think he is surrounded by advisers that have lost touch with reality.  Bush will end up like Lyndon Johnson and be accused of a war that isn't win-able.  \\n\\nOur prayers should be going to those who are serving over in Iraq and Afghanistan (and soon Iran I fear).

Have you realized then its you who abandoned him?\nQuestion: I've been going through a long period of time when I don't feel close to God anymore, and I can't seem to pray. It began when I felt he abandoned me and I was betrayed about how my dying mother was treated by a hospice staff. I guess I've felt guilty that I couldn't care for her at home in the end, but had to let her be put in the hospice facility. I'd promised her I'd care for her, and she was so frightened when they took her away from my home and they wouldn't let me ride with her. It's been a haunting memory and experience.\\n\\nI stopped praying. It has just been too hard too. It doesn't seem the same as it once was. I realize God didn't abandon me, or my mother, and that I've not been faithful to him and haven't tried to pray with any real effort. I feel it should come more naturally.\\n\\nWhat do you think about my failure to pray and the bitterness I've harbored about the way my mother died? What do you suggest as to how I could pray again?\nAnswer: I lost a loved one on christmas day, came home from church that day an dwas told that a loved one have just passed away. i was ticked off because I was at church during that time asking \"god\" to help this person out during their time of need. \\nSince then my resentment for pray and god has grown. \\nIn fact I had started to question the concept of god and religion more than ever and then after a few years have realized that god does not exist and that religion is used to exploit the ignorance of people.\\n\\nThings happen in life, people die whether by illness, accident, or other situations. What should matter is keeping their memories in your heart and never forgetting the good time that you have had with your loved one. But also cheerish their advice that was given to you. \\n\\nIf there was a god both my prayers and yours would have been answered by \"god\"\n\nAnswer:",

As a fan, I watch them do this every year...Strong start in April and May...waver in June / July...fall apart by August...out of it completely by September.

Circumcision of the general male population in the US was not common until after World War 2. This was medically-based not religiously-based. A popular myth spread that male circumcision results in fewer infections and the wife of a circumcised male was less likely to get any of the reproductive cancers. This theory has since been proved baseless. Male circumcision rates have fallen drastically in the last couple of decades. Only a minority of males in the US are circumcised as part of their religion.\n\nAnswer:",

K well the first night I dreamt that I was going back out with my ex boy friend..and that I was not thinking at all about my boy friend that I have now.. we seemed so happy..\\nLast nights dream was that I was with my ex boy friend and we were kissing in the forrest (dont ask.. its so random.. i know..) and then he just said take it slow.. :S.. whats that supposed to mean.. and I know that im not dreaming of my ex coz i still like him, coz i really dont.. I just find it weird that im liking him in my dreams.. evrey thing is going ok with my Bf  i have now.. so i dont ''miss'' my old one..\\nAnyways if you can help me by answering it would be great!! :)\nAnswer: I wish that you had been more descriptive with the actual dream.  Colors, surroundings, animals all play an important part.  But I will still do my best.  Your ex signifies \"voices from the past\".  It could have been anyone from the past, but your mind chose him probably so that you would pay attention to the dream itself.  The \"voices from the past\" are telling you that you are trying to grow too fast.  That you need to take the time and learn from what lifes lessons are trying to teach you now, not what lifes lessons will teach you in the furture.  Be(act,live) your age.  It is quite possible that you are trying to mature too quickly and that you are getting ahead of yourself.  SLOW you life down, there is more than enough time for the \"adult\" stuff when you are an adult.  Thus the kissing(intimacy).  Having adult(intimate)relations at a young age can and will do more damage than good.  Be young while you can, there are some basic lessons that need to learned before you progress to the more advandes lessons.  The forest signifies different levels of growth, from saplings to \"old\" trees.  The trees remind us that we should accept the rate at which we grow.  Today is today, and tomorrow is tomorrow.  Learn todays lesson today...tomorrows lessons when?...that's right tomorrow.  Trees also remind us to stay rooted to what is most important.  To a tree it is the earth, have you ever seen an uprooted tree grow, or live.  Our roots are our families.  Our families are our BEST resources, we need them like the trees need the earth.  You will grow up. You will eventually have all of the priveldges and responsibilites of adulthood.  There is no need to rush into it now.\n\nAnswer:",

I'm numb and dont feel anything when another guy likes me.. It's already been 3 weeks. Sometimes I just break out crying at home. I've been excercising a lot lately because it makes me feel better.. but the high wears off in a day and im back to being depressed. What's wrong with me?\nAnswer: Don't believe crying yourself to sleep at nights will help you to overcome a heart break. The first steps are to relax and spend some time with friends and family, not to mention going out and having some fun. These are all to take your mind off \"the heart breaker\". If that doesn't work, try meeting new people. The aim for all this is to open up your eyes, and allow yourself to see the truth. Which is that you are still a valuable person. Besides, look at it this way, you are not the one losing, he is. They are losing a unique individual.\\n\\nMy personal philosophy in life is that out of everything bad comes something good. Therefore, the bad thing in this situation is losing the person you love, hence ending up with a broken heart. However the good thing that will come out of it is that, with that person out of your life, you will meet someone new. Someone who will accept you and appreciate you for who you are.\\n\\nSo again, I'll ask, can one mend one's broken wings and learn to fly again? Sure you can. Love comes with a lot of risks so before falling, first consider the cost and weigh your feelings.\n\nAnswer:",

I have HP color printer.\\nTo be printed on stickers-labels\nAnswer: Are you printing the invitations or the labels?\\n\\nIf you're printing the labels, you can buy those pre-cut labels in stationery shops. The sheets are usually in letter or A4 size, and you have a choice of the size of the label and thus the number of labels that fit in a sheet. \\n\\nSome label manufacturers have a template (like a sample page with the lines matching the label sheet) that you can download from their website (look up the product code). Otherwise you can just type out your addresses in any word document and just try to match the spacing. Print a test page on plain paper first. \\n\\nThe other option is to get a label sheet that is A4 or letter size, meaning there are no smaller stickers cut into it. Then you just print normally and then cut it up with a pair of scissors. \\n\\nSo in other words, no need for special software at all, just any normal word program will do.\n\nAnswer:",

Society as a whole has this image of the perfect woman...she's cute, she's young, she's way too thin, she has lots of money and friends, doesn't seem to work, and always has a balanced life even if she has a job, kids and spouse.  Real woman struggle to even come close to what the media and advertising and magazines have set up as the normal standard for women.  It also doesn't help build self esteem when the men in your life are all of a more immature or shallow nature and subscribe to the above impossible definition.  As a woman ages and matures, she gains back a whole lot more self esteem and keeps it intact.  I hope this answers your question.\n\nAnswer:",

If you haven't done so, you can find the default IP address assigned to it in the manual. something like 198.0.0.1, then plug that IP in  the address bar in your browser and you will be prompted to enter the user name and password. which is by default usually user: admin password: administrator or vice versa. You can also check what your firewall IP is by going to the start menu, selecting run, and typing cmd then press enter. a dos window opens and you type ipconfig, then press enter, some info is returned the gateway IP is your firewall/router IP address. Once logged through the browser go to the advanced or security tab and make the necessary adjustments. for more step by step instructions I suggest visiting the manufacuter web site, consulting the manual, or googling something like \"setting up secure wireless network Linksys (or whatever)\"\n\nAnswer:",

Each fiber type requires a different approach. You are mainly concerned with type-2a and 2b. Type-2b has no endurance but is very strong so go heavey with 6 to 8 reps for a few weeks then switch over to type-2a meaning less weight from 15 to 20 reps, you can use your imagination and do inclined and or declined pyramid sets meaning you do four sets and add or subtract some weight each set. When adding weight your reps go down. You should never totally neglect your type-1 fibers, they are weak but have tons of endurance so maybe choose a weight were you can do anywhere from 50 to 100 reps with no burn but you only have to do this once or twice a month.\n\nAnswer:",

When i watch fox news and see people like Cindy Shehen (sry if spelled wrong) urgeing people to desert, and read some of these blogs on here it's amazing (in a bad way). If her son was here I prommis you he wouldn't like what she is doing.  I don't understand what is so hard to understand why we are in Iraq.  They posed a huge threat.  Iraq had WMDs or the at least meens of making them, and if Saddam had them there is no question that he would use them on us or our alies.  Iraq is 437,072sq. km, a little more then twice the size of Idaho.  They could be hidden in schools, underground, hospitals, peoples houses, or even have been shipped to other counrties. Could you find them? 3 of the best intellagence agencys in the world said Iraq had them...the Brittish, Russians, and us.  Empty chemical warheads were found, as well as an artilery shell filled with sarin gas, and another with traces of mustard gass.\nAnswer: It's because people believe the liberal media's antiwar message that they have been putting out since 911 to sway public oppinion against the war.  Add in a dose of several well put together, but poorly researched conspiracy theories and you get a reciepe that makes bleeding hearts and peaceniks think that the US Government is conspiring against them.  \\n\\nThanks for doing your part in helping to spread the truth.

Being one of those black folks myself I can say without hesitation that the use of the N-word is most certaintly NOT 'okay', regardless of who says it.  Just because a small sect of blacks continue to use the word, and are sensationalized by the media, does not mean that the entire race embraces it.  It is unfortunate that you're still making judgements and assumptions using such gross generalizations, but I can't blame you, per se, as it does appear that the use of that word is tolerated by blacks when you hear rap music or watch certain movies.\n\nAnswer:",

At that point, yes they are 'addicts' in the truest sense of the definition. Also, people using prescription painkillers over extended periods of time will devlop a tolorance and require higher dosages. \\n\\nWhen (or if) their need for the painkillers ends, it is typically very difficult to stop taking them. With will power, support, and a good doctor it can be done.\\n\\nUnfortunately, some people are not able to kick the addiction or the doctor cuts off the supply without a plan for detoxing. At that point, they will resort to alternative means of obtaining the prescription drugs (hence making them illegal drugs). Then they become addicts in the common sense of the term.\n\nAnswer:",
