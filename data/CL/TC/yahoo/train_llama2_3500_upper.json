In this age of the internet, even in its infancy at that time do you think that a show, and its staff could possess such a secret big enough to lead to cancelation, and no one lets it leak out.\n\nAnswer:",

The Big 3 did not make a fuel efficient car anywhere near comparable.  Last year in May, we traded in the Saturn SW1 station wagon for a 2005 Prius, again because Detroit did not produce what we felt was appropriate to mitigate the fuel crunch crisis.\\n\\nIt will likely be a few more years before Detroit comes around; they made the choice themselves, even asking Bush to kill the Partnership for a New Generation of Vehicles program, where they had produced prototypes of family cars that achieved over 70 mpg.  But they wouldn't make as high a profit margin as SUVs, so the Big 3 continued their role as pushers for the growing ranks of addicts. Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham said Monday, April 9, 2001 that seven years into the partnership, its ``direction is inconsistent with where the market is headed and where the automakers are headed.''\n\nAnswer:",

A myth is any story where a person goes through a journey of discovery.  Where they \"find themselves\" in the mythical woods (the world of the unknown) and come out of it a new person (think Luke Skywalker, who grew up to become a full Jedi).  So, that's your example.  Of course it doesn't have to be that long, lol.\\n\\nJust make the Rose (a wonder that has magical properties of some kind) a reward for some boy or girl who travels the world, discovering the \"secrets\" that keeps their village from growing or moving forward.  While discovering the magical secrets beyond the village, he meets new people, perhaps his father (finding ones Father is a BIG deal in mythology (again, Star Wars) usually the father set out to finish the quest but was unable or got caught up on the wrong side.  Finishing the quest, doing away with the BAD GUY and saving the father is usually what its about.\\n\\nJoseph Campbell was the EXPERT on the mythology and what it meant.  He was a great great friend of George Lucas and Lucas wrote Star Wars based on Campbells mythology work.  Campbell has many, many mythology books written as well as DVD's filmed at Skywalker Ranch.  Their awesome to watch him speak of myths and how they were made originally thousands of years ago and today, and both are practically the same.\\n\\nGood luck!\n\nAnswer:",

Like I mentioned above, the President works for us and he should do what we want. My loyalties belong to this country, not its president.\n\nAnswer:",

No one would listen if it was just happy fluff all the time, because no one cares about the good stuff. 99 percent of the time, it's about soldiers that have died for our country, and it's happening every day. Apparently republicans don't think that is important enough to make the news and that you're bias if you report it? Geez, you guys are so sensitive to critisism of your president, yet gave it out to Clinton so well?\nAnswer: Because the Republicans need as many excuses as possible to try to turn the numbers game back into their direction.  The public is catching on to the debauchery and the news is taking it and running.  Maybe it is a good thing..I don't think the American people believe anything any of them have to say. I know I lost any belief I had in the administration.  Total Buffoons.\n\nAnswer:",

The big step in their evolution is the drying of eastern Africa about 4 million years ago. When the jungles died and separated, what would become man developed a locking knee joint. This enabled them to walk much farther (and endurance run) to cover more ground and obtain more resources, putting them at a distinct advantage to other primates. If you don't believe me, try walking around without locking your knee, it's hard and taxing.\\n\\nThis adaptation allowed for the development of many other things that we've come to love: our large heads and brains (when we were strictly bipedal, we free up our hands for projects, and this favors big brains), short rib cage (for flexibility), and big butts (something has to give you balance when you don't have a tail).\\n\\nThis climate change occurred when New Guinea moved in the way of a prominent current that brought warm, moist water to east Africa. Over time, these newly smart, adapted primates radiated out of Africa and to the rest of the world. See links below for more info.\n\nAnswer:",

When you look at the Smackdown roster, the lack of heel has made the brand...lackluster.

Reason I was turned dn 4 work both local & abroad.I am an Archt. Is the reason legal?\nQuestion: I was diagnosed to have Hepa B in 1990. Other than that, I am very healthy, intelligent and a very qualified professional Architect. But due to my ailment, I have limited opportunity as I am turned down for work due to that reason. I find it depressing as it limits my opportunity for a decent living.  Is it legal? Isn't it similar to having HIV? I just want to have an equal opportunity. I also have a family to support. can they not judge me based on merits?\nAnswer: I feel for you, i have just been cleared of Hep B, when i got it the hospital were so unhelpful, they acted like it was all my fault and i deserved what i got (one nurse in perticular commented how i should'nt sleep about!!!). In truth, 3 years down the line i still dont know how or where i contracted it. when i got home i felt like a leper but my family were on hand for me giving me support and researching on the internet for me (even to the point of being vaccinated for me/against me) Are you in the US? is should be illegal for them to discriminate againt you on those grounds, you need to talk to a lawyer.

It's kind of like acting- if your girl plays the part of the sex kitten or the smoldering vixen, depending on what type of item it is- you're in for an INCREDIBLE night! If it sparks yours and her imaginations, then it's certainly more 'fun' than self esteem boosting-- it just happens that one USUALLY leads to the other.\n\nAnswer:",

It is somewhat burny but not like acid reflux either. It is sharp at times but is always at least a dull ache. It is a holiday weekend or I probably would have been to the doctor already.\\nHas anyone had similar pain? Thanks.\nAnswer: yes i had ulcer and what am i talking i still do,,, ulcer is something you cannot cure but you can take precautions.. i experience the same problems you do.   you need alot of rest, eat small amount of meals, ( eat every one hour if you have to ), stop worrying about anything, if there is any problem in liulfe, write it on a peice of paper and start thinking positive ways of handling it instead or stressing yourself.  keep taking your meds, take rest in between your daily activities, also once you had a meal make sure you have a PLAIN SODA, that will digest your food and so you will not have the burning sensation. All these what i am saying you can write it down and ask your doctor, he/ she will agree with my advice to you. As i have been suffering from ulcer since 1991.  Good Luck.\n\nAnswer:",

I saw your question and had to try this one.  A few years back I worked for Stanley Hydraulic Tools and the discharge pumps we sold we centrifugal pumps as well.   These pumps as yours are designed to move large volume not pressure. Closing the discharge side off should not damage the pump.....housing or impeller.  We had a hydraulic motor that spun the pump/impeller.  The hydraulic motor was constantly bathed in oil and even in a stall or a closed discharge valve situation the pump was protected.  I would encourage you to find out who the manufacturer of your pump assembly is and make this question out directly to them but I hope this in its self helps!  Hyway.\n\nAnswer:",

However, if the majority of any religions adherents practice a religion in a particular way, then THAT is what the religion is, regardless of what a minority say or what a verse here or there says.  Can anybody tell me which Muslim countries are tolerant, loving and peaceful toward other religions including Jews and Christians?\nAnswer: Dont take it by countries , because in the midevals , europe was more entolerant than the most islamic extremists of nowadays \\n e.g: was the crusadors invade palastine for the first time and entered jerusalem for the first time ( the city of peace ) they , by the name of GOD , killed every one alife in the city , even when civilians sheltered in the great musque , crusadors made that musque a lovely big blood bath , where they killed every one alife , years later Saladin entered the same city without killing a soul after it surrendered , and christians lived there after that in peace \\n\\ne.g 2 : when muslems invade spain , they last there for 800 years , and the christians still live there in peace as christians , nobody was forced to change his religon , but later when qween Ezabella and her huspand took back spain , they evacuate it from every muslim in less that 30 years ( of course by tortue and descrimination - having a koran at home was a crime could be sentenced to death penalty at that time)\\n\\ndoes that mean that christianity is a violent religion ? and islam is a peaceful one ? of course not ! so what does that mean ?\\n\\nthat means that the whole thing is a matter of civilizations , the more civilized nations , the more tolerant ones .... \\n\\nnow lets go to the modern days , the west , and now the far east too , is at it's peak of civilization , so it can be tolerant with anything , the muslim world is at it's worst days and laying in the bottom of civilization , that's why many of them cant think descent ... they are to blame others about what they are now , and as for there is no hope for being better , an individual violent terrorist efforts came up to face the world , to say we are the solution , and islam is what we stand for , and it ordered us to do so ...\\n\\nabout countries , countries still tolerant , for example , in Egypt , my country , the biggest billionaire is christian , and the other big ones many of them are christians .... christians work in everything as judges , oficers , minister of commerce is christian, i have christian friends ... etc.\\n\\nBUT , dont take countries as something to see islam from , because it's a matter of periods , that is the period where muslims are at the bottom , so dont excpect much from them , when christians were not so civilized , i told you what they did .... and new thing , when americans got black ppl from africa , where was there tolerance , those blacks had religions at that time , no body respect those religions , some of them were muslims , but they all were forced to convert ( again: does it mean that christianity is bad because what it's countries or followers do , no , but it was a matter of civilization )\\n\\nso dont blame islam for what the muslims at that time do , they are at the bottom now , that's all\\n\\nfor any comment feel fry to write at amgad_he@yahoo.com\\n\\ni hope that helps\n\nAnswer:",

His 'empire' is completely devoid of original thinking but they dont hide that they arent creative. They've stolen, bought over and assimilated all features from other OS's and programs in years past... BUT nonetheless, they've dominated. Excelled in all manner of business. Similiar to Steve Jobs but without the extreme eccentricity and non-conformist manner of appealing to the masses. Dell might be the new compaq, shortly. Cheap, barebones performance computers that are loaded down with crippled operating systems and proprietary software.. people dont stay clueless forever, but nonetheless they've become #1 by capitalizing on people's need to have what they believe is the best.. but yet dont know what they're doing.\\n\\nJeff the Amazon and Pierre of the 'bay.. innovators.

Because India has 300 million people who speak English, and has a democratic tradition for 60 years, it will surpass China if the Chinese devolve into quarrelling and trying to maintain an economy based on \"the Party.\"  But surpassing China, though a key benchmark, is not the same as unseating American power.\\n\\nBut for your dream to come true, local corruption has to shrink to the point where the smartest young people stay in the country with their PhDs instead of immigrating.\n\nAnswer:",

However, hurricanes have been known to stall or even reverse direction before continuing.  The hurricanes take enormous quantities of heat from the warm sea water and build up organized momentum that may have a life all its own.  When you let water out of bath tubs, there is a natural force (coriolis) that spins the whirlpools in opposite directions north and south of the equator; but you can start the whirlpool in the wrong direction buy hand and it will continue due to momentum.\n\nAnswer:",

I think that the stool looks quite normal, it does not appear to be hard, there is no blood, and sometimes it is soft...she cries all the same. so far I have eliminated heavy starchy foods from her diet, if i have to give her I crush it, I give her lots of fruit , juice, milk, veggies, water and porridge, very few snacks or sweet, she takes a daily dose of multi vitamins...DR. recomended- and cod liver oil which we only just started to give to her also on Dr.'s recomendation ....the only constant thing she has had from six months to present is cows milk and porridge made from cornmeal, or wheat.\nAnswer: Give her prunes and juice that has prune juice, or apple juice.  Also do not make an issue over her going potty, you can actually give her psychological problems and there are certain complexs in psychology that I can not rememeber the name of, off hand.  I think she may have a bowel stricture.  Have you had this checked?  By the way take her to another doctor for another evaluation also.  Maybe go to 3 doctors.  You can also buy infant glycerine suppositories, or give her metamucil with lots of water, they have orange flavored.  I am a nurse and have a psychology major also\n\nAnswer:",

Before, people would carry gold as a medium of exchange. Later goldsmiths would take care of the  people's gold, and give them \"receipts\" (much like banks today). Instead of gold being traded, these receipts would be traded, and when giving the recipt to the gold smith it would be yours. \\nSo the reciepts back in the day are much like dollar bill- which both are backed up by gold. \\n\\nAnd when you think about it, our own greed makes ourselves revolve aroung money. We as selfish humans tend to think that the more we have the better we are, but to get more we need money. It's a leson i was tought in my Economy class and i learned it in life too.\n\nAnswer:",

I came across one channel that was totally in Spanish, probably the telemundo channel.  Anyway rey mysterio was cutting a promo( obviously in Spanish) in the ring   This was not wwe tv, but I think it was some kind of lucha liebre promotion.  So he was cutting a promo and apparently called out MNM. Suddenly out of nowhere, johhny nitro, joey mercurey, and melina walk out of the crowd and over the security wall or gate, and enter the ring.  Nitro and Murcurey were dressed in jeans and there MNM gimmick fur coats, but no shirts on. Melina had on her regular flashy attire. Rey was dressed in a suit and jeans.  suddenly a ref comes out and we have a match. A masked mexican wrestler enters the ring to be rey's partner. The match starts with a typical MNM type match and goes back and forth. When rey is tagged he starts cleaning house.  Finally he hits the 619 and hurracanrana off the top rope with a suit on for the win!!! What was I watching?\nAnswer: recently some of the wwe wrestlers did go to mexico to shoot some promotions---maybe it was one of them.\n\nAnswer:",

The culprit then was the PLO, and then, as now, Israeli self-defence was the excuse behind a cynical attempt to destroy Palestinian nationalism and secure land for annexation in the West Bank. \\nRecently, there were two daring attacks against military targets and Israeli soldiers were captured by Hamas and Hezbollah. These attacks happened because Israel and its patron refused to accept the results of the Palestinian election. \\nOf course, before Hamas was elected, there was simply no partner for peace. Translation: There is no Palestinian leadership that will accept the injustice the Israelis want to impose.\n\nAnswer:",

That would mean that inner city dwellers are simply worse people than others. As for your question, lack of a quality education may have some effect. However, both crime and lack of education, although simultaneously influencing each other, could be seen better as symptoms of the conditions in inner cities, rather than one thing causing another.

Honestly are't both sides guilty.\nAnswer: What a fantastic question.\\nThe politicians are definitely dividing, because most of the American public straddles smack dab down the middle of just about every issue facing America today.  That means that most of us are fairly reasonable and mindful of the complexities that face us locally and nationally; daily and life long. But because of this phenomenon, politicians have to initiate a polarization in order to pull people off of the proverbial fence. How can you have a debate if most people agree? The challenge then, is to package an argument (no matter how seemingly insignificant) to inflame  so that people will start to choose sides. This model makes it easy to hide other real issues that won't be addressed due to the smokescreen created by the subsequent brou ha ha.\n\nAnswer:",

The \"truth\" that NATIVE AMERICAN INDIANS already had 100's of communities \"from sea to shining sea\" here in america! \\nWhen will INDIANS be given credit they deserve and ownership of land that what was robbed from them?!\\nChris columbus day is a PRESERVATION of \"anglo saxon\" heritage (mighty whitey) and a desecration and insult to our \"HOME of the BRAVE\".  ALL PEOPLE ARE CREATED EQUAL ......RED SKINS were slaughtered and robbed -genocide by the the \"WHITE \" man - without looking back, rather covered it up with a celebration of COLUMBUS day to distract people from the truth that columbus only discovered a place that he can start an extermination/ eradication / genocide of an entire race. To top it off the \"WHITE\" man created a GOV\"T PAID HOLIDAY out of it! ATLEAST get rid of that out of respect for NATIVE INDIANS\nAnswer: It makes me sick inside when I think of that subject. I actually had a very charismatic History Teacher, he informed us when our books were trying to brainwash us. What is truly sad is that white people didn't stop with the Indians.

People need to listen to more than just one source and definitely more than once every 4 years to find out what is truly happening in our political system. They might actually be surprised who does what and who doesn't. Wake up America!\nAnswer: It because of the cost associated with making a decision.  If you have invested time and energy in supporting something  and you see something that causes you to question your original viewpoint, you are more likely to discount this new information because it is contrary to what you had orginally thought.\\n\\nIn other words, anxiety occurs when your ego (sense of self) gives energy or plausibility to something you had previously considered a concrete point.\\n\\nThis is why their are initiations because the more hell you have to go through as a barrier to group membership, the more likely you are to stick with the group no matter what.\\n\\nA real-world example is how passionate certain members of political parties even when confronted with a smoking gun of wrong-doing.\\n\\nHope this helps.\n\nAnswer:",

So what's the fuss about?\nAnswer: yes...you are right... i live in Egypt,and the christians are not weak in Egypt,the Coptic are about 10% of the Egyptian people..but they have 20% of the Egyptian Nation income and the most rich man and family in Egypt are Christian (Saweires)...but most of them do not like to join the political life they prefer more to be successful in economy...but the bad thing some of the Coptic who live in USA or Canada try give false things about what happen in Egypt.i think they just want to gain more power.. but not all the Coptic people do that really...some of them..and of course the some political people of USA will not let this chance, they use that as a tool to make pressures on the government of Egypt....\n\nAnswer:",

Hun, that's normal.  A guy pumping his penis in your vagina repeatedly is going to trap air in there, if you suddenly change position or your muscles clench or he suddenly thrusts is deeply then the air is going to be randomly pushed out causing the sound of fastly escaping air which sounds like a fart.  Just recognise that a 'vart' is normal and that it's going to happen everyso often, just laugh a bit and carry on.  If your guy has any sense or maturity about him then he knows what's going on and will just be waiting for you to stop laughing so he can get back to what you two were doing before hand.  Guy's don't care, why should they?  It's not like you dutch ovened him.  Forget about it, relax any clenched muscles and get back to the good lovin' :D enjoy\n\nAnswer:",

If we put them on an island all to there selves they would revert back to their ancestrial ways because its been proven they cannot govern themselves\nAnswer: Just take a general look at the middle East and Saudi Arabia, Iran, Kuwait, Iraq, Palestine, Afghanistan in particular. What have they contributed to the benefit of the world & civilisation?\\n\\nWhere are there Engineers, poets, doctors, scientists, explorors, men of vision and wisdom, others of renown? Where are they?\\nFor the most part they are ruled by despotic family run businness's aided and abbetted by relious nutter extremists without any accountability whatsover!\\n\\nWhat education? There isn't any! Its indoctrination from the cradle to the grave. Watch Friday prayers all over the arab world & see what happens! The Mullah's rant and rave preaching their sermons of hate and the doggy faithful run out and cause / proboke havoc the world over. Extremist factions always to the for. The doggy faithful uneducated , cannot think for themselves, not allowed to question, analyse, discuss merits, weigh the pro's and cons. Led like simple minded sheep / indoctrinated by evil, senile, old, perverted twisted men who will stop at nothing to prevent freedom and democracy being estblished in their lands. For once it's established and the benefits accrued to the poeple - the despots and nutters will be turned out\\n!.\\nAnd they talk of their history and culture. What history and culture? 24 hour news media covereage news depicting nothing but aggression, conflict, riots, rape, pillage, sacking and burning.\\nWatch them. Scruffy, uneducated, waving guns, yelling abuse, etc, etc. What has the Arab World given us? Terrorism, hate, disruption, death, grief, loss, you name it - they perpetrate it.\\n\\nPeace, civilization, education, the right of freedom of speech, democracy / debate, the rule of law, adherence.,  will never materilze in the Middle East. It's about time the Allies pulled out of the Middle East and stood back and let the despotic families and extremist religous nutters fight it out. To quote the words of Winston Spencer Churchill - \"let dog eat dog\" Then the Middle East & the world will be a far, far safer place.\n\nAnswer:",

Your dentist is correct. Cost somewhere between $200-300 per side.  Believe me it is worth it. A hard denture riding on those bones would be worse then a bur under the saddle of a horse. You should heal in about a week and the dentures will fit better.  But remember a lower denture will never fit very well.  The tongue, lips and floor of the mouth will make that baby jump around the rest of your life.  I personal recommend that you see about having implants placed to help stabilize or anchor that thing in.  Never get mad at a dentist for a poor fitting denture. It will never be as good as real teeth.\n\nAnswer:",

I'm trying to learn all I can topside, so I read quite a bit. \\nI was never taught that the cylinder valve should be turned back 1/4 turn or a short way... in fact, in my confined water dives and the others that I've done since certification, I've never done that; I've just opened the valve.\\nMy b/f says you should turn the valve back a bit, I've read it should be turned back in a tips booklet published by Scuba Diving magazine, yet on the Scuba Diving website, it says that the valve, once opened, should be turned back a bit or NOT AT ALL.\\nWhat is the correct procedure?\\nThanks!\nAnswer: Open it fully (not hard) and back off 1/4 to 1/2 half turn. No more or you may cause turbulence in the 1 st stage (heat it doesn't need) and potentially causing condensation in there. Not a good thing for the reg and definitely bad news if you're diving a normal reg and even an environmental, in freezing conditions. It can also cause a possible a supply issue at depth, when you need it most. Leaving it fully open, could cause the valve to stick, making detaching the 1 st stage a vexing experience to say the least.\\n It is part of the course, you may have just missed it. I've seen Instructors whip through that part mumbling.\\n\\nEdit: I disagree with Don on the fully open part regarding overheads etc. So NOT true nor taught in any wreck course or technical diving course. You ARE taught to know your manifold without the need to think. If indeed you do start to turn it the wrong way, the little it has been shut is an immediate indicator. Also, when it's backed off just that little bit from open full, it has NO impact on supply or smoothness of flow to the 1st stage.\\n\\n Edit: Yup, ask your buddies, they'll agree. As for the fella that answered last...well I guess he's never seen one occur nor read even the OW manual from PADI ( I dug it out, it's in there.). It DOES happen. Just like that outdoor tap that you opened too far and need a wrench to close.\\n Due to the amount of dive related questions that are popping up, this evening during a social at the local pub, I asked a pal of mine that owns a 5 star Padi to join under his shop's name. A number of years ago, this man saved my life on a wreck dive, and he's about to become a PADI Director. That's about as high as you get in that particular org as well as standing in my book. I'm not an instructor ( I got bugged again to do the course tonight for free), hence my reluctance to put the word of \"god\" into some of my answers here. Mine is strictly advice and experience.\\n He can. Hopefully he'll join.\\n If you're curious, his shop's web site is www.coltcreekdiving.com\\n heck, I think there may be a pic or two of me in there too.\n\nAnswer:",

It's the cold, hard truth, but we have to learn to accept it. There's an old Native American proverb which goes something like this: \"Truth looks for eyes unclouded by desire.\" And we, as humans, naturally desire the belief that someone or something watches over us and protects us. It's comforting for a while, but for most, that comfort begins to dwindle 'till it is merely a flickering flame. \\n\\nThink about this: (for this example, we'll use a horse.) What made a horse (meaning, not in a reproductive sense but THE first horse), A: men, B: spacemen, or C: fairies? Just because the first two aren't true doesn't make the last one correct.

I was watching a documentary on Japan, and I was almost in tears, I was stunned how \"real\" people are there, there beautiful traditions, and hard-working happy people, Education is VERY important. It seems in America everyone takes everything for granted.\nAnswer: People are too materialistic here...they think that money is pleasure which is not always the case. People will go to all extents for money and the worst is when they sue each other or companies for the dumbest reasons. The latest I heard is someone sueing Apple 'coz iPod can cause deafness, which I personally feel is a really stupid excuse. So instead of enjoying all things in life people spend day and night running behind money. Respect for other people is almost absent compared to other civilizations like Asian, Indian, etc and you can see that the people there have less stressful lives (although they might not be faring as well monetarily). They have a culture which Americans don't. People dont fake their love for other people like many people do in the US. I am not saying that all people in the US are bad and all people in the above countries are good. But these are cultural tendencies...\n\nAnswer:",

Both detect nothing wrong with my PC. Why does Windows File Protection keep asking for my Windows XP setup CD?\nAnswer: I run all the same programs. First log onto Windows up date and make sure you have ALL of the available updates for XP(especially the security ones,you may be surprised if there are a lot).You may have to disable Adware to do this. Then make sure you are running Nortons fire wall and not the Windows default firewall(this is usually done automatically upon Norton set-up). Make sure you run live update on Norton Program every day that you log on to the internet. Do not trust Any Auto up-date programs! Run A full virus scan manually now and no less than once per week. Then see about reloading your set-up program. If this does not work, Try resetting your computer to the very first day you installed XP and repeat the above procedures. Somewhere, something in your setup program has been removed. If you continue to have this problem, E-mail Microsoft's Help Desk. GOOD LUCK!\n\nAnswer:",

The internet is growing quickly to become a gigantic hub for information exchange and it seems that there will be enough people in this world who wants to share their varied experiences on a regular basis. On the other hand, there are also enough people who would want to read other people's stories.

It is safer to keep an enemy close by your side. Plus if you had an argument try and resolve it. It feel better knowing you have lots of people who care about you, rather then hating you. Never know the other person may feel lonely as well. You be the bigger person and apologize, this will start some open and honest conversation. Good Luck.\n\nAnswer:",

A state which previously had been considered \"cured\" with democracy putting people to death for conversion?  It makes you wonder what the fuck we spent all that money on.\\n\\nAlso when it comes down to it Bush can't run again.  He doesn't have to build his own approval rating so long as the Republican party stays popular (the Dubai ports deal and immigration are issues the party will continue to criticize Bush for, at least in rhetoric). In this manner they will continue to sign away things like bankruptcy protections (best for credit companies), Tort protections (best for big insurance companies, and no, medical costs won\u2019t go down for most medical work), and immigration law (best for big manufacturing companies).\\n\\nThe list goes on.

Today, only a century later, we are about 6.3 billion.\\nResources don't multiply as people, so technique has to do it.\\nGMOs started mostly because the pressure of those countries who give subsidies over the price, making profits disappear for those who produce crops.\\nRR Soybean, the most famous GMO, for example, was obtained not by modifying the DNA chain as most people think, but adding cytoplasmic DNA, which only enters in action when needed to syntethize sulfur amino acids, so its DNA remains untouched and has no risk of developing diseases in the future as Greenies think.\n\nAnswer:",

What you do is take cards with different color combinations on them and show them to students ranging from kinder-garden to the 12th asking them which color combination is their favorite. The first case is where you do it individually and then as a collective class. You should find that the younger children will stand by their first choices even during a group decision. As the children get older they are more prone to follow the choices of their peers until the later years where individuality take hold once again and they start to diversify. I used pie charts and percentages to display alot of the information and also split up the classes into males and females for a follow up experiment. Its been many many years since I did it but I'm sure the results will fascinate the judges. Good Luck!\n\nAnswer:",

Male or female?\nAnswer: Well, males are more likely than women to get at least one orgasm, especially if the male controls proceedings.  Many women do not get to orgasm via penis in vagina sex.  Those women are thus (obviously??) likely to desire sex less than those men.\\n\\nIf women explore their sexuality, they can become multi - orgasmic, and can achieve massive prolonged orgasms, that might well exceed what men experience.  They might desire sex even more than the men involved.  I suspect that only a minority of women do this, however.\n\nAnswer:",

Steve Finley is currently tied for 90th with 124.\nAnswer: The main reason for the \"death\" has to be that Baseball stadiums are consistantly getting smaller to promote the \"long-ball\" which most fans pay to see.  For instance the Polo Grounds in New York used to be almost 500 ft. in center field...hit it past the center fielder or to the gap and it doesn't not only go to the wall, but, IT KEEPS ROLLING! allowing the baserunner to easily get to third.\n\nAnswer:",

Keeping your area within certain specs.  You learn to be more aware of yourself.  Depending on your tech school (career choice), you may get more discipline there.  Security forces is a little tougher.  Para jumpers will have more.  I think that you can make the right moves to make you more disciplined.

Even people we may have known... we have not opened ourselves to dating with them and they may have other ideas and expectations.  Its always best to hash that out... outside of your home.\\n\\nThat being said... I would suggest starting with a glass of wine (don't have more than one bottle opened).  You can initiate conversation in a relaxed way without the dinner table.  Then invite him to the table and serve a small salad... remove the pasta you have kept warm in the oven and heat the bread.  You can then enjoy a salad until the bread is done. Serve the bread and pasta (maybe seafood pasta (I find seafood sexually appealing - but you may need to ask about allergies before hand).  It is simple but it allows you to concentrate on your guest (so do that) and not the food.  I might also say make sure you have the ability to make tomato soup and grilled cheese if a disaster hits.  If you wanna get him involved in the meal... I think we are talking the third date or so... buy steaks and a grill...lol.\n\nAnswer:",

Especially  regarding atheists........have you ever wondered ?\nQuestion: Not everybody is religious. Not everybody even claims to be spiritual. Many people say : we have one life on this earth and that's it. Many people believe that when we die we end up as food for worms.\\nSo.......the question is......if people deep down do not \"feel\" something , they should not have any morals about killing, getting what they want at all cost..After all : if we only end up as ashes with nothing to believe in : life does not count. We will all die after all. \\nI have always wondered what atheist thought about that.\\nI am in no way judgemental. I am just wondering. How do you justify your life and why should there be morals after all ?\\nJust curious about how your mind works..\\nThank you.\nAnswer: I guess I can answer that, somewhat. That is a very deep question. I see it as this, If you run around and act as if others feelings and and others belongings mean nothing strictly because you dont believe in a God or after life then that makes for a shallow person. You still have yourself to wake up to. You still have children to raise. Maybe when they get older they will choose to embrace a religious figure. That should be there choice. I dont shove religion down my Childs throat, I also do not denounce religion of any sort. I still have myself to wake up to. I guess it boils down to your morals. Chris...\n\nAnswer:",

Once you give the examples of body language you can then explain how someone could interpret folded arms as someone who is supposedly protecting themselves or is being unapproachable. When maybe their arms are folded because of something totally different. Or how a look with the eyes could mean one thing to me and something different  to you.\\nThen the presentation can end with how, ad least i always heard that, 90% of communication is body language, a language that can be easily misinterpreted.\n\nAnswer:",

It has been agreed for eons that no species will be allowed to leave their home star system if they insist on taking their gods with them. Humans may not have to worry about that, however. Over the centuries, your planet was a curious place to visit once or twice and was not considered very interesting . Sure, your wars showed us how undeveloped you are as a species.  Your infantile,(in cosmic terms) dependence on god concepts does not bode well for you and neither does your penchant to breed beyond your planet's ability to sustain you. We are now showing an interest in you because it is not often that we get to observe a species commit suicide. You are so close to maturing as a sentient species and it will be a shame to see you kill yourselves. There are just not enough of you becoming rational enough to force the issue. You let the least among you determine your fate, so be it.\n\nAnswer:",

Please know that I am only asking this because I support US efforts to liberate Iraq, and truly wish for you to be a free people...and to service men and women...thanks for all you do\nAnswer: though i am not iraqi,but my mother is and i lived  in iraq till i left it last year more than 40 years,but i think i have the right to answer you.\\n1. the war has almost totally destroyed the country.iraq was the jewel of the middle east,now it is a heap of garbage.it is the richest country in the whole world.now its people have the the rank of the 5th poorest country.in the 80,s iraq imported 3 million egyptian workers,now the unemployment is 80%.iraq who is floating on oil is importing gas,kerocine and disel.their prices have jumped 20 folds in 6 mounthes.\\n2.from whom was iraq libreated.it was a sovrign independent country since 1921,it is now under occupation.if you think that removing saddam from power is the lebriation of the country,then i suggest you read a criditable book about the deserting army soldeir who by miracle claimbed to the chair of the vice president in 1968 without any qualifications or any service in the government,accept being a gangister,when he was at the age of 29.who was behind him..\\n3.there were more than 15 attempts of assasinations and coups by the iraqi army and diffrent people sectores against saddam.who used to warn him,and give him full informations.\\n4. wasnt easier and much less costlier to assasinate him since his regime was badly decaying instead of sheding blood from both side with these astronomical figures of us dollars.the proof for that is the us army faced no resistance in invading the country,had the regimn not decayed,the casualties would have been immence.the iraqis are known to be stubborn fighters,\\n5.i wish that those who speak of the rebuilding of iraq give the names of the hospitals,roads,electric power stations,schools,water purifying plants ,and the locations of these new projects.otherwise why the electricity is much worse than it was before the war,till now.\\n5.no one dosent like the democracy,but every culture has its own way of democracy.dont forget that iraq has 10,000 years of accumilated culture behinde it,it isnt easy to impose the american ideals and way of democracy on it in short time. it is natural that it is rejected.yes the iraqies lived black days since 1958,but the occupation made things worse.\\n6.above all there was real security,who dared to kidnap a person before,he would be executed infront of the victims house.noe in the last 3 mounthes the kidnaping rate is 200 persons per day,halfe are wqomen and children.that is one example.who can dare cretisize any official.who can complain anything to any official,where can the officials be found to complain to them.in 1950 my fraind says taha if your phone goes out of service,it would be repaired in one day,now after lebriation it took 15 mounthes and it is not working yet.\n\nAnswer:",

How long depends on the thickness of the sedimentary rocks deposited on top of the particular clay layer (pressure helps evacuate water and increases temperature); whether or not there is an external heat source (volcanic activity, magma chamber nearby, metamorphic processes - faults, etc.). SO - time can't be specified unless is a case study, temperature -  between 150 and 200 degrees C. Above 200 c is the schist kingdom in metamorphic rocks.\n\nAnswer:",

I know I should have not done  what I did but! I paid a great deal for that mistake and I still am.\nAnswer: IF I get beat while in Police custody and DID nothing to deserve it, I don't care what my lawyer said, I would sue.  The problem is that we are a sue happy country and people sue when they are only angry for getting what they deserved!  BUT IF your case is legitimate, then you should sue (and I was a cop).  The only way to stop bad cops is to file a civil rights violation with the FBI and a civil suit.  When Departments start loosing a lot of money for what a few bad cops do, they will change their ways and get rid of the bad apples.  Their is NO EXCUSE for beating a person in handcuffs and behind bars - their are other ways to control an individual without getting your testosterine off.\n\nAnswer:",

America is a diverse country too. Some naive Americans may hate certain people and it is around all races hating on each other, not just everybody hating on Arabs. Just because of the acts of few of your people is all it takes for some Americans to draw a conclusion about your ENTIRE RACE and start to hate. IGNORANCE.\\n\\nI am sure, there is racism in your countries as well against Black Arabs, or the Filipinos or other Asians working/living there. No doubt.\n\nAnswer:",

A failure at being a liberal disc jockey named 'rusty', he became a welfare case, then was arrested in Pittsburg for soliciting homosexual prostitutes! His 3rd wife complained of a \"sexless\" marriage, and one of his former boyfriends says that he \"guarantees that none of his show marriages was consumated\"!  Later he campaigned to put ronald reagan on Mt. Rushmore, claiming that he voted for him when in fact he never did. He then became a devious drug addict who violated federal drug laws and got off scott free, due his contacts in the republican-led government, for whom he is a loyal parrot. He now calls himself rush limbaugh, his 4th alias!  Why do people so blindly follow this shameless druggy closet-queer former welfare case hack??\nAnswer: The same kind of people that followed Hitler. And that's about as dumb as you can get.

Many cultures have certain food groups that are known to be most beneficial to the growth, health, and longevity of we the people, and with a combined educational and medical program people living under these conditions generally do much better than in other parts of the world where such requirements are non-exsistant.\\n\\nI believe doctors are quite sensitive when it comes to lifestyle issues, particular lifestyle changes culture to culture, or simply topographically. In closing it's important to remember that no matter what resources and qualities are available to all, one has to take the initiative to act upon their own personal requirements and conditional factors to maximize a standardized outcome.\n\nAnswer:",

I'm doinag an exam and they're all much too thick..?\nAnswer: you can check your line and pen settings and how they are printed by going to :\\nFile,  Plot (or Print depends which version you are using), and then the plot window appears. On the left (in my version (autocad 2005)) You can see \"Plot Style table (pen assignments) there you can choose a pen assignemnt, Mostly you choose acad.ctb. You can change the setting by clicking on the pen next to it.  In the next window you can change to pen assigment per color. I usually use the next ( they correspond the the old fashion inkt pens) \\ncolor 1 (red) = 0.18\\ncolor 2 (yellow) = 0.25\\ncolor 3 (green) = 0.35\\ncolor 4         = 0.5\\ncolor 5         = 0.7\\ncolor 6         = 0.9\\n\\nI use color 8 and 9 for Hatching, = 0.15 these colors I print in the own color, the others as black. For a normal drwaing you use the first 4 mostly. You can save the pen assigments per drawing, or set it as a standard. You should also check when you are drawing you got the toolbar \"Propoties\" open, and the lineweight is \"by layer\" and nog something thicker.\\ngood luck!\n\nAnswer:",

The NYSE stated members can sell in 3 steps 1 year, 2 year, 3 years.  The NYSE did not give exact dates.  But we are talking about 70% of the value of the company minus the cash the members received.

You should be extra careful with details in those marketing materials, NO typos, no false statements, try to be as accurate as possible and, of course, try to have those materials in at least two languages. Also be ready with quotation templates and check the payment method best suits you. again trust is important in this regard.\\n\\nIn this stage you may find in statistics about export of your country (given in any Economy Ministery website) about top foreign countries that most likely buy the kind of products you choose to sell from your location, keep it simple but be persistent as it takes a lot of work to get the first order, however, once you start, yopu will be in one of the most lucratives activities of the world and prosper you, as well as your family.\\n\\nAs you don\u00b4t give further details in your question I assume that you are starting from scratch, so, don\u00b4t worry, try to strenght relations with your friends and family, and the friends of your friends and the family of your family, try to find in your personal network those fellows that may help you connect the chain (find the best provider or find the first client) in any case prepare your selling speech for each case and be ready to show leadership and motivation, remember that doing business is a human activity and in involves inter-personal relationship skills.\\n\\nAlso, remember to keep it simple, export follows the same principle of local selling, you buy as cheap as possible and sell as expensive as possible (your profit will be the difference)\\n\\nbuy cheap and sell expensive (but be fair in both sides)\\n\\nDon\u00b4t kill the gold eggs chicken by trying to get all the eggs at once, keep you baance and try to not be so greedy.\\n\\nBeware of international scams!.  In my website www.somosnegocios.com  I have many recommendations for doing business internationally, check in the FAQ section, If you have further questions feel free to ask me.\\n\\nBest regards\\n\\nAlejandro\n\nAnswer:",

Should this be the way to keep us bitter amongst ourselves so that we don't realize that they are still just politicians that don't have a real job, dont really do anything or make any decisions-thats what we vote on in local elections, and we pay them a tax free salary in which they give themselves raises. Speak up people\nAnswer: the system is not representative and not democratic.it does not represent the diversity of the public and the spectrum of the minority's and leave out other alternatives that should have representation like in a parliamentary system.the system is no democratic because the differences between party's are posturing and more a matter of style than real differences.look at the way the elections are financed and how those moneys are spent in advertisement to grease the media.good luck america.\n\nAnswer:",

Moon is heavily afflicted and so the Venus. Your ego and your short temper is your enemy. Don't take it granted that all the glittering are gold. Married life will be OK but love failure is sure and certain. Come out of your aggressive nature and follow politeness. \\n\\nBelieve in God, pray to God regularly. Seventh house is occupied by Guru, so you have the blessings from God but the present Dasha is not favourable (Shani-Rahu) therefore be polite and detach yourself from your filthy 'friends'. Listen to elders. If possible wear \"sea-pearl\" in a silver ring. \\n\\nYour horoscope is brilliant and teaching line as well as business line will suit you best.

A review of this phenomena has been done.  A quote to give you an idea:\\n\\n\"All investigations in the literature have been subjective, the urine being smelled by individuals (sometimes a panel of individuals) who had been previously shown to be able to positively smell and identify asparagus-related odorous urines. However, with subjective assessment, apprehension always exists concerning the results. \"\\n\\nSo, they can't even decide on who smells what.  Anyhow, the paper is easy to follow, so go have fun, it covers beetroot as well.  As to why it \"makes\" it through your system so fast, the odor producing chemicals are quite soluble, and serum levels of highly soluble ingested chemicals can be detected in a few minutes.  Try taking a liquid B vitamin supplement a few minutes before you need to relieve yourself.  It gets glowing yellow quite rapidly.  Hope this answers your question.\n\nAnswer:",

Read before it goes into the trash.?\nQuestion: Debtors Prisons are back!!! Do you know that the recent changes in the bankruptcy laws have put YOU at risk?\\nDebtors prisons were here before but only for poor non custodial parents who could not pay support(those that could pay did before being jailed) And even those non biological parents that DNA had excluded but the court still imposed support for the benefit of the child(about 30% nationally jailed and NOT the biological parent). This carries a felony conviction which also takes away your right to vote(among other rights). NOW you can be hit with the same contempt charge for being too poor to pay your credit off. This can also put YOU in jail with the same Felony conviction.. How do you feel about the new industry in the United States being Jail construction and maintainence to house all the poor that will now be classified as felons(and that includes you who have difficulty paying your bills now)? After already losing freedoms through the patriot act are we now at risk of losing our liberty? I may be wrong but I thought this was the United States of America.

She doesn't let you speak without interupting and always has to be right. She steps on everyone and tries to take control even to her superiors. It's so annoying. It's a small office so do I just ignore her or say something..I want to be kind.\nAnswer: When you know she is wrong about something, get the proof and put it on her desk 9don't let her know wher eit came from.) Or, get a couple of people to work with oyu on this, but when she is beeing to interruptive, take her to the side (liek a professional should, witha stand by if need be, then she can't freek) and say. I am sorry to tell yo this, but I do not apprechate the way you talk to me or the way you interrupt (really anyhting that is on your mind.) She wil be embarressed, promise. Also, have other people do the same. Be sure to stay professional. Also, the best thing is when you knwo she is wrong about soemthing and you have proof. If you can stay consisten, stay professional, don't back down, and have other people do the same, I promisse she wil stop that soon (she wil be more uncomfortable than she makes you). That is not beeing rude, or not nice, it is beeing professional. You have a job and it seems that your interrest is in having a good work environment and therfore, for the better of the business or job. Remeber, take her to the side, with oneother person max, if you do it infron of people she will might get divensive and it can back fire. She might anyhow, but just start aut your conversation with:\\n\"I am just taking you to the side to tel you something and really do not want a reply, but rather have you think on it. So please listen and no hard feelings. This is a work place and it is for the best of the business (Unit, Team, whatever it is) that we have a good work environment and  this and that is not helping. SO please think on it and maby we can talk about it. (Always best to havea third person there, just so she cannot say you did or say something bad or wrong to her.)

How many SKILLED workers could be here if there were not 12 million criminals here who stole the American dream from them?  They say they are not criminals?  Tell that to the skilled foriegners living in worse places than America who will never get to raise a family here because they are taking their place in the American dream.  Mabey they can hold a rally aimed at asking all the illegal immigrants to give THEM a chance at the American dream...  Do you think they would give the sympathy that they are asking for themselves?

In the meantime they moved a sofa from one flat to another (1 mile journey). After discovering the mess I decided to visit them complain, and withdraw both properties (they where empty). The boss called and said i owe them \u00a3100 for moving the sofa, i told her no way, her husband called and suggested he would collect it personally.  Do you think they are sh*t or is a man and a van worth \u00a3100 for 30 mins work????\nAnswer: can you charge them for miss conduct? they promised to do a job they haven't done?\\n\\nis it the agencies responsibility to clear mess left by a tenant? isn't that why private tenants pay security deposits?\\n\\nask a solicitor, you will get 30Min's free from some. nothing is worse than a ripped off feeling, i do hope you get sorted soon and maybe you should raise your security deposits to cover any losses in the future. there are some really nasty people out there.\n\nAnswer:",

Or less?\nAnswer: try man on top and tell him to go slow! when it hurts, speak up. \\n\\ndo you use tampons? probably not. they hurt first couple times.

Why would God change his MO at the end?  I find this notion ridiculous without meaning to offend.\nAnswer: in the end, destruction is final but the consequences are eternal...it will not take long to destroy people who are evil..it is the evil soul (mind, will emotions)that is burned up.

Be careful whom you date from now on. If he has a live in girlfriend when you date him then you are fooling yourself that he will leave her for you. A well-mannered man will leave one girl before starting to date another. Get some education if you can and learn how to take care of yourself. If this man comes back and wants you do not go with him. He will only do this because the other girl kicked him out and he will leave you when he finds someone else. He has a proven track record of this. Does your government help single women with children on getting groceries and housing and such? If so apply for help, if not then like I said get a job or go home to your parents if they will let you.\u2194\n\nAnswer:",

That is obvious. For some reason we are NOT to know more about the details. Probably because it is part of the plan. If we knew more it would alter our behaviour. This way humans develop to their true self. If the spirit they contain is that of the light it will go to the light. If they belong to the spirit of destruction they will inherit destruction. This way the \"secrets of many hearts will become revealed\". \\nBUT (!) No human is to decide who belongs where. God forbade even to the angels -way ahead of us in the circle- to judge. Judgement is only God's. We are to love and help each other. And we are to gide those who have eares to hear to the light. If they are that of the light they will listen and become what they are: One with the light.\\nPeace to you, friend!\n\nAnswer:",

Yup. But what?\\n\\nThe Government? yeah, that's what the people usually would complain about. \\nPoverty? yeah, that's what the people usually would meet in some busy street. But the deadliest trouble of all,Filipinos haven't noticed yet \\n\\n-You see the Philippines' like the movie Friday the 13th: the victim dies long before he finds out who slashed his throat.

When you go into the splits try to focus on sitting up straight or even bending back to try to touch your back leg. Scorpions are all in split flexability and back flexability, so do back bend (or bridges) whatever you call them too. If your problem is just that you cant pull it close enough to your head try slipping a band around your ankle and pulling it to your head that way. \\n\\nMost importantly though, just make sure you aren't forcing it. I know you say you need to have it soon, but its not worth injuring yourself over it since there are many other cool lib variations you can try. Change it to stretches, or maybe even scales. It may not come over night, but if you keep working hard and stretching, eventually your scorp will come.\n\nAnswer:",

As you mention, your brake lights are meant to alert the driver behind you.  Without a considerable amount of education, I think it would be difficult to train other drivers to interpret what you are doing with your brakes.  When accidents are caused it may become the burdon of the person braking to prove they did not cause confusion in a law suit.  If everyone has the same brakes, there should be less (lawyer caused?) confusion.  For example, some drivers merely tap on their brakes to alert a tailgater to back off.  The brake light comes on with little or no real braking action.\\n\\nHowever, there is no reason that novel methods of making brake lights more practicable, efficient and reliable should not be adopted.  Modern cars now are required to have brake lights in the rear window as well as at the tail lights; because that places them more at eye level.  Progress is slow but sure.  There is in engineering what is called the \"coke bottle\" effect.  For many many years Coke used the same small green coke bottle, because it worked!  If you change something that \"works\" you may solve one proble but create three new problems.  That said Coke did move on to use clear glass Coke bottles and bottles in larger sizes and plastic too.  Each advance may have given them new production headaches while on the learning curve.  I'd encourage you to pursue your novel ideas; but always search for the adverse effects.  Good luck.\n\nAnswer:",

I earned my bachelors degree in Criminal Justice and Business and 4 languages all online and finished them all in allot less time than on campus. And most business is finding online studies as an advantage because the student can also get his work experience on top of the education. As example doing my studies online I also worked for a multi-billion dollar company. With all that experience I\u2019m only 20 years old and I make $225,000 a year which however I started my studies early at age 18. Very important however to make sure the school is accredited that makes a world difference. Good Luck!!!\n\nAnswer:",

What to do?\nQuestion: It is not news that fifa has the absolute power that corrups absolutely.  We see it time and time again.  Brazil has the easiest schedule by far.  No other country has it easier.  Not only that the schedule was made to give Brazil more time to rest and to avoid powerhouses like Argentina, Germany, France, or Holland until the final instances.  Even then bad refereeing like tonight's shameful display by Horacio Elizondo on the game that \"gave\" Switzerland the pass to the next round.  Havelange and Blatter, Brazil and Switzerland once again.  The same old story.\nAnswer: I feel your frustration and I am in agreement with your assessment. Too many false red-cards have found their way from referees pockets into play during this cup -- which is completely opposite from the 2002 World Cup play (battles).

I think we gravitate to what makes sense to us a man who refuses to let his religion interfere in legislation some believe can't be trusted.  I agree with Ann Coulter it boils down a relgious belief but both sides have their extreme representives the self-proclaimed Joan of Arcs and Buddah's.  All politics is faith based it's just a matter of where one invests his faith.  The problem with defining them comes when one side defines the other based on contrary views but that's politics.

If we had an idealized 'stasis field' (a container or defined zone in which time could be prevented from passing), we might be able to perform experiments to determine whether the things inside were still subject to entropy or whether they were removed from the general entropy gradient. The current prevailing theories hold that the contents of a stasis field (or container) are unaffected by entropy. This leads to the concept that entropy might be stripped from the events which cause it and transferred from object to object or from place to place, leading to unexpected catastrophes for no apparent cause. Once more, these things are difficult to determine.\n\nAnswer:",

I was in Paris recently and did see many baguettes and bikes, especially with motors, but not a beret in sight! My impression of the Parisians- intelligent, sophisticated, friendly, classy. No ear splitting music, loud cell phone conversations, jeans and sneakers on anyone over 20. They dress well, behave well, take the time to enjoy life. They don't run themselves ragged to do more business, make more money, appease the stockholders. Their tax rate is high- they are willing to pay more than lip service to care for all their citizens. Gas is expensive, traffic is bad and space is scarce, so even new cars are small and efficient, they are for transportation, not status symbols- not a Hummer anywhere. And the public transportation is outstanding! Very wise in my opinion.  Maybe you're watching old movies: there would of course be old cars, n'est-ce pas? We're not all cowboys and remember, only half supported King George!\n\nAnswer:",

But after even several months and not a cigarette on my mind, my true question is is how do you keep from that instant \"WANT\" out of thin air especially after something sets you off and makes you want one?  What is good to DO instead of bumming that one smoke that eventually leads you into buying a pack and starting all over.  It's the violent thoughts and rage that make me grab a smoke this way, and THE PATCH only wacks me out and gets me in a strange high!\\n\\nI have also noticed when I quit, it seems like everyone I see at the red light is \"puffing it up!\"  I realize this is just pyschological recognition and it does not bother me, but I have smoked for ove 20 years.\nAnswer: I think your question is an excellent summary of the situation that most smokers find themselves in ... I'm in exactly the same position - have just stopped (again!) - 6 days now - after 30/day since December ... No patch, no nothing... but ... will power ... and SPORT !  I think sport, and the ensuing self knowledge/respect, are perhaps the way out of this ...\\n\\nI do triathlon, and smoking like I did is in no way compatible with the life I want to lead...  \\n\\nThink about sport ... You need to give time to sport to make your life different, better...  To make your life whole, healthy, clean, and hopefully, cigarette free ...\\n\\nI will probably fall again, but then I will also stop again ... for the same reasons ...   \\n\\nWe need to find pride in ourselves, see what addiction really is, and be stronger than the cigarettes that chain our lives ...\\n\\nGood luck to all of us ;^)\\n\\nAnd to HELL the Big Money Tabacoo Companies and their shareholders who cream benefits from the demise and illness of others !!!\n\nAnswer:",

He seemed kind of overly nice and his overall mannerisms kind of gave me a gut feeling about him. He offered to pay for lunch for fixing his car. Thats when the problems started. I wanted to have a decent conversation about something normal like women or cars or sex. traditional guy talk. But somehow he steered every subject i started into the bible! I am not 6 years old i know about God, I didnt live under a rock. Can they not tell i am unconfortable being preached to in a cult like way? I seriously wanted to sacrifice him with chair but being put in this awkward situation i decided to lean in and tell him i am the anti-christ so he can shut the hell up about how sinful i am for having premarital sex with my girlfriend. Seriously, what makes them so righteous pushing their beliefs on people?\nAnswer: Born agains are the worst.They are usually ex whores,sluts alcoholics and drug abusers...The worst of the lot,but when the spirit of God hits,and you realize the healing effect of it,it makes you want to spread the miracle of what happened.Now,however,most do not know the difference between;witnessing,and being pushy and annoying.the Born again christian is the greatest tool of the devil.they will push you away from God quicker than satan himself.Most totally forget the book of Matthew,where it is very clear about Judging another.i usually just listen to them,then when they least expect it,I go into full attack mode of quoting book,chapter and verse,then they realize I already know God,better than them,and they leave me alone\n\nAnswer:",

I watched the game there were no such things as unseen fouls.\\n\\n2 Do you know when it is apenalty ? when the handball done inside the penaltybox is deliberate. None of the handballs you say were deliberate.\\n\\n3 The linesman's flag was up , clearly, Frei was in a offside position. BUT when the ball was passed it touched a Korean player on the way . Thus it turned into a pass from a swiss player to a misspass from a korean. In case of a misspass the players offside position gets nullified, even if the whole swiss team was in offside & a misspass was made. this is the FIFA rule from 2003. The ref can overturn linesman's descision. He followed the rules & was right.\\n\\n\\nGood for Korea as they got a test of their own medicine. Remember how they cheated past Italy & Spain in 2002 ? The people who said Korea deserved it need to consider these facts after 2002-\\n1 Korea didnt win Asian Cup Japan did\\n2 Korea finished 2nd to Saudis (!) in qualifiers\\n3 They lost 3-1 to Ghana in the build up.\\n\\nHow come you Koreans not say anything about how Vieira's legal goal was mistakingly ruled out ?

Golf instructors are typically under-qualified  in my opinion.  There are merely a handful that really worth their salt.  One acid test I use is whether the instructor has a grasp that golf cannot be explictly \"taught\"... the learning, for any player, comes thru self-discovery and experience.  The instructor's role is to convey WHAT needs to happen in a cause/effect fashion, but there are numerous ways to \"implement\" a given what. And more over, the verbage rarely translates into \"feel\".  You can't explain \"feel\"... but rather guide a student to constructively acquire feel thru guidance.  Finally, I feel instruction RARELY touches on the mental aspect of both playing and learning.  What constitutes good practice??  How to play under pressure...  My list of rants goes on and on... so YES, I think an objective reviewing source would be fantastic.  Other comments?\n\nAnswer:",

So bush needs to be empeached\\nThough i know he's better than Kerry, at least bush knows what he wants and is doing it, nobody would be afraid to bomb our country if Kerry was in office.\n\nAnswer:",

The speaker of this hymn is an officiant at the Temple of Athena of Argos, preparing for the ritual bath of the statue of the Goddess. \\n\\nAll you that are companions of the Bath of Athena, come forth, come forth! I heard just now the snorting of her holy horses, and the Goddess is ready to go. Hurry you now, O fair-haired daughters of Pelasgus, hurry! Never did Athena wash her mighty arms before she drove the dust from the flanks of her horses - not even when, her armor all defiled with filth, she returned from the war with the lawless Giants; but far first she loosed from the car her horses\u2019 necks, and in the springs of Oceanus washed the flecks of sweat, and from their mouths that champed the bit: cleansed the clotted foam. \\n\\nO come, daughters of Achaea, but bring not myrrh nor alabaster (I hear the whir of her axle now!); bring not, you companions of the Bath, for Pallas myrrh, nor alabaster (for Athena does not wear perfume), neither bring you a mirror: she is sure of her beauty. Not even when Paris judged the contest on mount Ida; the great Goddess looked not into orichale nor into the transparent flow of the river Simois, nor did Hera. But Aphrodite took the shining bronze and often altered and again altered the same lock. While my Goddess, after running a two-hundred stade course, like the twin Spartan stars on the banks of Eurotas, then did her simple annointments: oil from her olive tree, applied with skill; and the blush, my dear maidens, that ran up her body was like the color of the morning rose or the seed of the pomegranate. Therefore now also bring you only this masculine virgin oil, with which Castor and with which Hercules anoint themselves. And bring her a comb all of gold, that she may comb her hair, when she had anointed her glossy tresses. \\n\\nCome forth, Athena! This company pleasing to your heart awaits you, the maiden daughters of Acestor\u2019s mighty sons. Athena, come, the ancient rite is begun, the shield of Diomedes is carried to Inachus, an Argive rite taught by Eumedes, your beloved priest who on a time, when he knew that the people were plotting and planning his death, fled with your holy image to the hill called Creion - and set you in rocks, you, O Goddess, on the rugged rocks, whose name is now the Pallatid rocks. \\n\\nCome forth, Athena, Sacker of Cities, Athena, helmeted in gold, Athena, who rejoices in the crash of horses and shields. Come. Today, the city will drink from small springs and fountains, but not from the river; girls will dip pitchers in Physadeia today, maidens will bear water from Amymone's pool where the daughter of Danaus lives. For, mingling his waters with gold and with flowers, the river Inachus will flow from his pastoral hills, bringing fair water for the Bath of Pallas Athena. But beware, O Pelasgian river, brim your eyes to the Queen: the man who sees Pallas, Keeper of Cities, naked, shall look on Argos for this the last time. Come, Lady Athena, and meanwhile I shall say somewhat unto these. The story is not mine but told by others. \\n\\nThere was a time in Thebes, my dears, Athena loved a nymph, loved her to distraction, loved her more than any other, the mother of Teiresias, Chariclo by name, and was never apart from her. When Athena drove her horses towards ancient Thespiae or towards Coroneia or to Haliartus, riding through the farmlands of the Boeotians - or toward Coroneia where her grove is heavy with incense, and her altars lie close to the river Curalius - often did the Goddess set the nymph upon her car and there was no dalliance of nymphs nor sweet ordering of dance, where Chariclo did not lead. \\n\\nYet even Chariclo did many tears await \nAnswer: Sure is confusing.\n\nAnswer:",

If it sprinkles, my teacher still made our class run- through the mud, too! That's why we have uniforms for p.e., so that when we wear our normal clothes, it wouldn't be all muddy and dirty- Though if it starts pouring, our teacher would tell us to go into the gym. I mean if the school is the cause of one's sickness because they got a cold from the rain or something, that's bad for the school/ ..Anyway, I think the rules vary from each school.

I'll never work again!  While recuperating now, I forgot to withdraw my resumes from the internet for Nursing jobs.  Was send several emails about job offers from prestigous medical/health systems.  How depressed would you be to find out that your getting offers for these jobs knowing you can never take the jobs?  I'm fighting for my workers compensation from that employer where I got hurt.  Do you think I should include potential earning capacity as part of my law suit seeing these job offers are with top dollar health systems.?\nAnswer: Absolutely! In addition to your medical expenses and general pain and suffering, your lawyer SHOULD also factor in loss from future earnings..and this is a figure that you can quantify based on the offers you received X expected work life......there is case law that allows for it.....\n\nAnswer:",

Events here often resemble festivals.\\n\\nwww.schooldisco.com 70s, 80s, 90s guess the dress code?\\nSat Hammersmith\\n\\nwww.carwash.co.uk\\n\\nHAVE to be in 70s,80s, 90s or other fancy dress or no entry. More outragious the better. they have a pool and jaquzzi clothing optional just not your club outfit... thats swim wear, underwear, half or zilch... Frequented by 18, 21st hen and bucks nights. Plus pre book or unlikly to get in.\\n\\nwww.starkersclub.co.uk\\n\\nNude nightclub\\nThis one is pretty wild not for anyone too young... the dress code of nude or for girls no more then thong. No changing room and 400 capacity... mainly guys say 95% if you girls want thrills, but mainly gay too. if thats your thing.\\n\\nYou could have a laugh with your male mates ie send them down thinking there will be 200 naked women, follow and photo them comming out when they realise its mainly blokes.\\n\\nThe church aussie club sunday afternoons... pretty mad. get there 12-1 in the afternoon. Stay to the end. Male stripper every month or so. Wild drinking games, raunchy dancers, mad acts , up for it crowd etc.\\n\\nGet out of where you are going and look around... Brixton good for rave nights and gigs but don't go near Cold Harbour lane.\\n\\nExplore Camden and the markets and find Cyberdog the shop with the wildest clothes around...Centre of alternative London... you could find people there who can tell you where to go.\\n\\n\\nThe London Eye\\n\\n\\nPS there is a festival tommorrow ie sat in finsbury park.\n\nAnswer:",

He loved his freedom and had a hard time realizing he's hurting me with this. Now, things got better and better.For 1 year or a bit more he's been talking about marriage now. Just dropping it from time to time.Sweet but i don't know? There is not much physical attraction (and never much been).but i love him very much and adore him. He is like my veryveryvery best and most important man&friend in life&i am afraid to lose him! but i definitely always missed the \"other\" part of a relationship..you know. Now when things are going so well,why do i worry and try to break free???\nAnswer: The heart wants what it wants. The more you deny the longer it goes on until you break free anyway. You're a \"complete package deal\" kind of personality. You want an awesome inside and a good outside. Nothing wrong with that. You have to make a hard decision for yourself that will free him to seek someone better suited to love him as he is. Good luck.\n\nAnswer:",

I often say Ill give myself a new outfit, trip someowhere, whatever\\n* record lectures on tape and when yo get home type out the important stuff\\n*if you write down the notes in class, type out the important stuff on your computer when you get home, its like a review, it jogs your memory\\n\\ngood luck :)\n\nAnswer:",

It should do all that it can diplomaticly to protect its citezens but the individuals need to take responsibiblity for their own safety and understand that some places are not safe to visit.  Its the same in most Islamic nations, in China, in many African nations, and in some areas of India.  You can't count on the U.S. government to bail you out of every bad decision you make in your life.\n\nAnswer:",

Costing Americans 300 BILLION Dollars a MONTH and it has no end in sight.   \\n\\nThe Borders have been an issue since the ALAMO and an ISSUE whenever either party requires a shield to cover the truth.

I have to go to hospital next week for a knee replacement in the right side, unyet I spent a week looking after a friends dog, in a high mountain, walking, and enjoying fresh air, since I know what movement I have now, I will have the benifit after my operation. you must not let your muscles fail at an early age, you will be worse as you get older. enjoy life, exercise also gets a control on depresion, which if you are not getting out enough, I would say you are suffering with. you will enlarge most muscles and blood supply, which I am sure you know you need to enlarge****\n\nAnswer:",

Make the Tax experts in various organisations scratch their\\n    heads in terms of employees' salaries.\\n3. Keep the taxman at work\\n4. Gives us a message : \" Do not take us Political Leaders for\\n    granted.\"\\n5.

You would have different \"statuses\" like booked, confirmed, paid etc. Imagine having a change in date/cancellation and you have to relocate etc. So, normally it would be in pencil and loads of rubbing off and rescheduling! Then with a code, they would have another file with the details of the booking - names, contacts, invoice etc.\\n\\nI actually helped out a change over from a pencil and paper system. Truth is that the basics are pretty much the same, the visual system is now digital! Plus, I'm sure there are many which still use the old system!\n\nAnswer:",

All of your brain activity get confused because of the state that you are in. The brain cells try to recollect and reorder but it causes a confusing state- like a dream. Most who think they had a near death experience have heard someone talk about it before and had a sleep peralous, which is a abnormal function when your brain is confused whether ur awake or asleep. Bottom line, near death experience could be possible- you won't know untill u have had one.\n\nAnswer:",

There are also three contributions the the red shift and they are only due to gravity   . The only direct observations of star/galaxy motion is for transverse (proper - angular) motion. Changes of light intensity could demonstrate receeding motion but there are other causes of light intensity. See: http//inventing-solutions.com/simplified-universe.htm for details.\nAnswer: Yes there is.\\n\\nSupernova decay curves show the time dilation that would be expected from rapid motion (i.e. taking the redshift as a doppler velocity) so we know it isn't tired light.\\n\\nA lot of other methods of measuring distance have been developed and those are used to calibrate the redshift measurements (by finding the Hubble Constant).\n\nAnswer:",

I'm one of those working on if I can until 70 but find I'm english but dicriminated against due to my age!!!.The letter says if any changes you must tell us,but their directions to me state under the question what should you do now,YOU DO NOTHING we will contact you, they didn't it cost me a small pension of \u00a315 although I have alifelong injury from a work related accident that caused this. I was one month over 65 when I contacted them. The job centre advised me 65 does not apply it means 65 or when you retire finally.  The pensions help line told me that decision is rubbish. I appealed against the decision based on when they created this situation when I was age 63years. the offending dept will not let me appeal and although I appealed the enquiry said I cant appeal as they refuse to turm it down so its not available to appeal against. what a waste of time, democracy!!\nAnswer: Sorry for your problems, but that's what you get for expecting anything from socialist governments, and why it is better to provide for yourself rather than expecting it to be provided for you.\\n\\nBecause the government that has the power to provide you with all that you want, has the power to take all that you have.\n\nAnswer:",

I was wondering why scientists finally end up on quite small rotator for wind power station. So I find out it was the most efficient construction. However I tried to develop it. Current construction allow to produce electrical energy only from enough strong wind. I focus on sailing-ships and imagine what if add some kind of gathering funnel to increase impact of wind on rotator. The funnel would be regulated like sails in case of wind weakening or getting stronger. Unfortunatelly I cant figure out the angle and size of the funnel because I dont have access to an areodynamic tunnel and I dont have proper knowledge how to calculate it, so I need someone qualificated to test, develope and posibly introduce it into life. I have also idea to build some kind of half and empty inside pyramid with rotator on the ground (maybe even underground). I hope someone work on silencer for the rotator because it would allow to add them even in built upon area.\nAnswer: I doubt it would work very well; you'd need very substantial sails with strong support structures. Being large, they would also require expensive maintenance. I think the current setup has been carefully tuned for efficiency too; the long, thin blades on the turbines are designed for maximum lift (and therefore maximum torque) with minimum drag.\\n\\nSo, my analysis is that it's unlikely to be economical even if it does slightly increase the performance.\n\nAnswer:",

And just few min. ago even!\\nSorry, there\u2019s no way at all!!\\nAround you find miraculous drugs and creams, different herbal products and at last some machine as like as the pump and the extensor! Everyone sold those products on anonymous web sites and with high costs! That\u2019s just should be an alarm bell\u2026 eh?\\nMaybe the extensor could give you a penis a bit longer (but thinner) after many times, BUT there are some implications. Aside of a flaccid penis, with the age it will be more difficult to have a strong erection after such treatment! Just value with care the situation and please know that any person is wonderful for what he actually is and the good sex isn\u2019t measured thro the penis length!\\nSex is possible with penis very short even!\\nBe happy anyway!\n\nAnswer:",

Re-Birth??\nAnswer: Nobody gave a concrete proof.\\nMany scientists too agreed who made studies on it.\\nLET US SEE LOGICALLY.\\nScience says both energy and matter are neither created nor distroyed only they change the forms. Life is a form of energy which has a special capacity to work to attain something it desires to achieve. That means it will catch a new body to complete unfinished tasks.\\nBhagavadgeetha ch.2. Verse 15, says.. \"dEhinoosmin.....\" It means just like one attains youthhood from childhood and then the old age he attains another fresh body after death.\\nch.2. V 22, says - The life force(energy) scraps the old or spoiled body and changes to a new one, similer to a living individual changing the old or unusable dress material to a new one.\\nThere are long and appropriate answers to a few importent questions.\\nWhat controls the next form of birth? (Short answer - The actions, Karma). Is an individual has the choice of next \\nform of birth - Short answer Normally No. But Yes After the  MOKSHA (The deliverence). After Moksha one can choose the form and nature of his next body or birth).\\nThe experience of this life will be passed on to the brain chip of next body just like an e-mail passing from one computer chip thru the WEB to another BRAND NEW COMPUTER, without any dependence of the computer where the mail is originally created. \\nScientifically a freqency perfectly catches another similar frequency, and therefore we can select different channels in Radio and TV. Similarly the life energy will have a certain thought frequency depending on the previous body experience. Therefore it can select the parents of similar matching thought frequencies for its next birth. For example if some one behaves very cruelly like tiger and remains as criminal in the world, and if he never repents his cruel actions, his mind freqiency will match with that of a tiger. After leaving the present body that life energy may select a tiger as its mother because of well matching frequency available there!      \\nEnough for now.\n\nAnswer:",
